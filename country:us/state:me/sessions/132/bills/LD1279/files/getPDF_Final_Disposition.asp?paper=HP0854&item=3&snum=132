Resolve, Establishing the Biotoxin Testing of Cultured Scallops Pilot
Program
Sec. 1. Biotoxin Testing of Cultured Scallops Pilot Program established.
Resolved: That the Biotoxin Testing of Cultured Scallops Pilot Program, referred to in
this resolve as "the program," is established until December 31, 2027. The Department of
Marine Resources, referred to in this resolve as "the department," shall oversee the
program. The purpose of the program is to conduct biotoxin testing of whole cultured
scallops or the roe of cultured scallops in the same manner as the testing for other cultured
mollusks under the Marine Shellfish Toxins Monitoring Program, established in the Maine
Revised Statutes, Title 12, section 6076, including using high-performance liquid
chromatography testing. The department shall provide logistical support to a commercial
fisheries business engaged in scallop aquaculture in conducting the testing under this
section, including providing transportation of samples to be tested from a facility in the
municipality in which the grower is located to the testing site. For the purposes of this
section, "high-performance liquid chromatography testing" means a testing technique in
analytical chemistry that uses high-pressure pumps to separate, identify and quantify
specific components in mixtures. The program may not conduct testing on cultured
scallops or the roe of cultured scallops grown on limited-purpose aquaculture license sites.
Sec. 2. Report. Resolved: That the department shall submit a report on each year
of the program, by January 1, 2027 and January 1, 2028, respectively, detailing the number
of commercial fisheries businesses using the testing under section 1, the overall impact on
the scallop aquaculture industry, including economic growth and cultured scallop landings,
and recommendations for further improvements or expansions of the testing under section
1 to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over marine
resources matters. The committee may report out a bill based on the 2028 report to the
Second Regular Session of the 133rd Legislature.
Sec. 3. Appropriations and allocations. Resolved: That the following
appropriations and allocations are made.
