4 Housing unit residents who receive federal supplemental security income or municipal
5 general assistance benefits that are used in whole or in part to pay for housing or utility
6 costs and do not receive other federal, state or local government assistance targeted
7 specifically to housing or utility needs, with the exception of households for which the

9 fuel costs and their eligibility for annual home heating fuel assistance may not be
10 limited by this section; and

12 primary home heating fuel source of the household, including wood, electricity or any
13 other home heating fuel source, except that annual home heating fuel costs may include
14 only the cost of heat and may not include the cost of the fuel for any other uses of the

16 §1700-I. Benefit amounts
17 1. Percentage table. The commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall by rule

21 benefits for the following year. The maximum percentages contained within this table must
22 vary by household size and annual household income. The percentage may not exceed 90%
23 of applicant households' annual home heating fuel costs.
24 2. Maximum percentages of costs. The maximum percentages contained in the table
25 established in subsection 1 must provide proportionally higher benefit percentages to
26 households with a gross income of 154% of the federal poverty level or less and
27 proportionally lower benefit percentages to households with a gross income of 155% to

29 3. Payment rate. Annually, based on the number of eligible households that have
30 applied to or are projected to apply for the program, and on the eligibility of households in
31 the benefit categories under subsection 2, the commissioner or the commissioner's designee
32 shall by rule set the payment rate that must be used to determine the amount of annual home
33 heating fuel assistance for each eligible household. The payment rate may not be greater
34 than 100% of the maximum percentages under subsection 1.
35 4. Calculation of benefits. In the case of a household for which the cost of heat is not
36 supplied by the landlord, the household's annual home heating fuel assistance benefit is the
37 household's annual home heating fuel cost as described in section 1700-H, subsection 2
38 multiplied by the maximum percentage for that household in the table established by
39 subsection 1 and multiplied by the payment rate established in subsection 3.

41 participating in a public, subsidized or Section 8 housing program under the United States
42 Housing Act of 1937, Public Law 75-412, 50 Stat. 888, Section 8, as amended, are eligible
43 for an annual home heating fuel assistance benefit under the program in an amount equal
44 to 30% of the benefit the household would have received if the household were purchasing
45 home heating fuel directly or in the amount of $50, whichever amount is greater.
Page 4 - 132LR1166(01)

1 6. Certain households participating in programs. Households that are participating

2211 Commissioner of Health and Human Services must engage in cost-effective purchasing
2222 practices to maximize the use of public funds, including purchases of home heating fuel
2233 before the heating season begins, fixed price agreements, automatic home heating fuel
2244 delivery and negotiations with home heating fuel suppliers on behalf of program recipients.
2255 The commissioner must establish by rule income eligibility requirements and how to
2266 determine the amount of benefits an eligible person may receive. The commissioner is also
2277 required to certify home heating fuel suppliers to be eligible to participate in the program.
28 The Office of Home Heating Fuel Assistance administers the program and the federal
29 Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, develops and recommends policy changes
30 for the commissioner, explores alternative and additional funding possibilities, both public
31 and private, and prepares an annual report. The bill establishes the Home Heating Fuel
32 Assistance Task Force to advise the office.
33 The bill requires the commissioner to set aside funds for the crisis home heating fuel
34 assistance component of the program and adopt rules governing crisis situations for the
35 expenditure of the home heating fuel crisis funds and to establish the income eligibility
36 requirements of households for receipt of crisis home heating fuel assistance.
37 The bill also directs the Public Utilities Commission to require natural gas suppliers to
38 provide a discount program to income-eligible customers.
