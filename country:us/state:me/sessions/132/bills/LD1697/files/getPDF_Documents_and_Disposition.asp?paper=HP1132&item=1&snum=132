3 Pt. B, §6 and affected by Pt. X, §2, is amended to read:
4 A. A person may not violate this subchapter or a rule adopted pursuant to this

16 rule as described in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A. Clear and convincing

1 1. Establish a penalty schedule for violations of the laws and rules governing pesticides
2 to create transparency for future penalties assessed;
3 2. Provide the means by which separate civil suits may be brought against the same

11 SUMMARY
1122 This bill increases the maximum fine that may be adjudged for a violation of the laws
1133 and rules governing pesticides from $1,500 to $25,000 except in a case for an unauthorized
1144 pesticide application in which the preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that the
1155 violator benefited substantially from the violation, in which case the maximum fine is
1166 $50,000. Maximum fines for subsequent violations are increased to $75,000 and $150,000,
1177 respectively. The bill provides that clear and convincing evidence that only one person
1188 benefited substantially from an unauthorized pesticide application constitutes prima facie
1199 evidence that the person is responsible for the unauthorized pesticide application. The bill
2200 increases the maximum fine for a private applicator who violates rules regarding the
2211 maintenance of records from $500 to $1,000 and from $1,000 to $2,000 for subsequent
2222 violations.
23 The bill directs the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, Board of
24 Pesticides Control to adopt routine technical rules to:
25 1. Establish a penalty schedule for violations of the laws and rules governing pesticides
26 to create transparency for future penalties assessed;
27 2. Provide the means by which separate civil suits may be brought against the same
28 violator of the laws and rules governing pesticides if pesticide migration through soil or
29 bedrock occurs affecting more than one property;
