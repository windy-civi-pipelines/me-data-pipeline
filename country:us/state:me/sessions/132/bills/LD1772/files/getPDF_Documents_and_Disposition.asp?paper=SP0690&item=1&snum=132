28 disbursement plan an amount from the internal flexible account to the elderly low-cost drug
29 program under section 254-D that when added to the General Fund appropriation to that
30 program for that fiscal year totals $2,400,000. The internal flexible account may not
31 otherwise be used to fund medical care. Year-end balances remaining in the internal

35 board of a funding disbursement plan, the trust shall transmit informational copies of the
36 funding disbursement plan to the Governor and to the joint standing committee of the

38 does not require approval of the Governor or the joint standing committee of the Legislature
39 having jurisdiction over public health matters.

9 must be credited to the administration fund, and any funds unspent in any fiscal year carry
10 forward and remain in the administration fund to be used to defray administrative costs. In
11 any year, the board may not disburse to the administration fund an amount greater than the
12 amount allowed pursuant to section 1517, subsection 4, paragraph C. The board may also
13 use the administration fund to contract for reasonable professional assistance to help review
14 input received from interested parties, to develop the funding disbursement plan under

24 information, preparing for meetings, analyzing public health issues at the direction of the
25 board, communicating with stakeholders, writing reports and such other board support and

28 lawfully delegated to the coordinator by the board.
29 3. Bylaws. The board shall adopt bylaws for the governance of its affairs consistent
30 with this subchapter.

34 established under Title 5, section 12004-G, subsection 14-G, and other state agencies and
35 authorities the missions of which relate to the purposes of this subchapter, in order to
36 minimize inefficiency and duplication and to ensure consistency and effectiveness.
37 Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, upon request of the trust and upon
38 the approval of the commissioner or director of the state agency receiving the request, other
39 state agencies, officials and employees shall cooperate and assist in the administration of
40 the trust as needed to further the purposes of this subchapter.

17 bonded either by a blanket bond or by individual bonds with a minimum of $100,000
18 coverage for each person, or equivalent fiduciary liability insurance, conditioned upon the
19 faithful performance of their duties. The premiums for the bond or bonds are administrative
20 costs of the trust.
21 2. Indemnification. Each trustee must be indemnified by the trust against expenses
22 actually and necessarily incurred by the trustee in connection with the defense of any action
23 or proceeding in which the trustee is made a party by reason of being or having been a
24 trustee and against any final judgment rendered against the trustee in that action or
25 proceeding.

40 but must carry forward in the trust fund and be available to be used immediately for the
41 purposes of this subchapter, upon the sole direction of the trust. Any interest or investment
42 income earned by the trust fund must be credited to the trust fund. The trust may use the

8 advance from the General Fund to the trust fund to provide money for disbursements from
9 the trust fund. The money must be returned to the General Fund as the first priority from
