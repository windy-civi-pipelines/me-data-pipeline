1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 35-A MRSA §3204, sub-§11, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 287, §1, is amended
3 to read:
4 11. Affiliated generation outside service territory permitted. Notwithstanding
5 subsection 5, an affiliate of an investor-owned transmission and distribution utility may
6 own generation or generation-related assets in accordance with standards of conduct
7 adopted under this subsection as long as the generation or generation-related assets are not
8 directly interconnected to the facilities owned or operated by that investor-owned
9 transmission and distribution utility. The commission shall establish, by rule, standards of
10 conduct governing the relationships permitted under this section between an investor-
11 owned transmission and distribution utility and an affiliate of the investor-owned
12 transmission and distribution utility that owns generation or generation-related assets that:
13 A. Prohibit a transmission and distribution utility from taking any action that favors
14 such an affiliate or adversely affects a competitor of such an affiliate in a manner that
15 is unjust or unreasonable;
16 B. Ensure the separation and independence of such affiliates; and
17 C. Protect ratepayers.
18 For purposes of this subsection, "affiliate" means a person who has any direct or indirect
19 ownership interest in, or is a direct or indirect subsidiary of a person who has any ownership
20 interest in, the investor-owned transmission and distribution utility, but does not include a
21 wholly owned or partially owned direct or indirect subsidiary of the investor-owned
22 transmission and distribution utility.
23 Any affiliate generation or generation-related assets permitted under this subsection that
24 do not have a commission-approved long-term contract or term sheet under this Title as of
25 July 1, 2017 are ineligible to participate in a long-term contract under this Title.
26 Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are major substantive rules as defined in Title 5,
27 chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.
28 SUMMARY
2299 This bill permits an affiliate of an investor-owned transmission and distribution utility
3300 to own generation or generation-related assets in accordance with standards of conduct
3311 adopted by the Public Utilities Commission including when the generation or generation-
3322 related assets are directly interconnected to the facilities owned or operated by that
3333 investor-owned transmission and distribution utility. The bill also removes the prohibition
3344 on affiliate generation or generation-related assets participating in long-term contracts
3355 under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A.
