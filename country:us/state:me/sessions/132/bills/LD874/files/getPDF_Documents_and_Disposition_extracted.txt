7 SUMMARY
128 This bill establishes the Government Shutdown Loan Guarantee Program. The
139 program, administered by the Finance Authority of Maine, or FAME, provides access to
1140 no-interest loans for certain federal employees in Maine or State Government employees
1151 affected by a partial or full shutdown of the Federal Government or the State Government
1162 that lasts for longer than 7 consecutive days by guaranteeing up to 10% of the loans eligible
1173 credit unions and financial institutions make to affected employees.
18 Under the bill, affected employees are eligible for up to 3 loans during a shutdown,
19 each equal to their monthly after-tax pay, less unemployment benefits, up to a maximum
20 of $6,000. Eligibility must be proven by the employee based on certain requirements. The
21 creditworthiness of an employee may not be used as a factor to determine eligibility for the
22 program.
23 An eligible financial institution that makes a loan pursuant to the program is prohibited
24 from requiring repayment of the loan during the grace period, which is the time during the
25 shutdown or 90 days after the disbursement of the loan, whichever is later, and from
26 imposing interest on the loan for 180 days following the grace period. Following the end
27 of the 180 days, an institution that made a loan under the program, after a good faith effort
28 to collect the principal amount of the loan, may apply to FAME for repayment of the
29 uncollected amount of the loan in default. The Treasurer of State is required to transfer
30 funds for the payment of the uncollected amount to FAME, which is required to make the
31 payment to the eligible financial institution. FAME is required to make reasonable efforts
32 to recoup the amount of any payments made to eligible financial institutions from the
33 employee who defaulted on the loan.
34 Finally, the bill gives the joint standing committee of the Legislature having
35 jurisdiction over appropriations and financial affairs, in consultation with the joint standing
36 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over financial services matters, authority
37 to report out legislation to address any funding needs of the program.

7 SUMMARY
128 This bill establishes the Government Shutdown Loan Guarantee Program. The
139 program, administered by the Finance Authority of Maine, or FAME, provides access to
1140 no-interest loans for certain federal employees in Maine or State Government employees
1151 affected by a partial or full shutdown of the Federal Government or the State Government
1162 that lasts for longer than 7 consecutive days by guaranteeing up to 10% of the loans eligible
1173 credit unions and financial institutions make to affected employees.
18 Under the bill, affected employees are eligible for up to 3 loans during a shutdown,
19 each equal to their monthly after-tax pay, less unemployment benefits, up to a maximum
20 of $6,000. Eligibility must be proven by the employee based on certain requirements. The
21 creditworthiness of an employee may not be used as a factor to determine eligibility for the
22 program.
23 An eligible financial institution that makes a loan pursuant to the program is prohibited
24 from requiring repayment of the loan during the grace period, which is the time during the
25 shutdown or 90 days after the disbursement of the loan, whichever is later, and from
26 imposing interest on the loan for 180 days following the grace period. Following the end
27 of the 180 days, an institution that made a loan under the program, after a good faith effort
28 to collect the principal amount of the loan, may apply to FAME for repayment of the
29 uncollected amount of the loan in default. The Treasurer of State is required to transfer
30 funds for the payment of the uncollected amount to FAME, which is required to make the
31 payment to the eligible financial institution. FAME is required to make reasonable efforts
32 to recoup the amount of any payments made to eligible financial institutions from the
33 employee who defaulted on the loan.
34 Finally, the bill gives the joint standing committee of the Legislature having
35 jurisdiction over appropriations and financial affairs, in consultation with the joint standing
36 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over financial services matters, authority
37 to report out legislation to address any funding needs of the program.
