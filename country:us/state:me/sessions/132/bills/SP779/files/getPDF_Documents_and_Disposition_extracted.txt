RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Thirty-second Legislature
now assembled in the First Special Session, on behalf of the people we represent, take this
opportunity to designate May 2025 as Maine Treatment and Recovery Court Month in
recognition of the efforts of all professionals and participants who make our treatment and
recovery courts work and of the significant contribution our treatment and recovery courts have
made and continue to make in the fight against substance use disorder, by helping our citizens
in their recovery and in restoring hope.
