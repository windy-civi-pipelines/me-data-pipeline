14 facilities, within 125 miles of the proposed mining operation.
15 The human health impact assessment must include a human health risk exposure plan
16 that will ensure that, every 2 years following the commencement of mining, the
17 permittee will perform risk assessment modeling for human exposure to air emissions
18 from the mining operation, consistent with the human exposure model established by
19 the United States Environmental Protection Agency, with the results of such modeling
20 to be provided to the department.
21 The department shall review the human health impact assessment and may approve,
22 reject or require modifications to the assessment;

36 the mining operation for the same duration as financial assurance is required under
37 subsection 1. The insurance must provide sufficient coverage to address potential harm to
38 members of the public located adjacent to or in proximity to mining areas or affected areas,
39 including, but not limited to, harm resulting from fires, explosions or flooding originating
40 at or caused by the mining operation and harm resulting from exposure to air, water or soil

19 municipality or county commissioners with information pursuant to this subsection shall
20 attend one or more public meetings within the municipality or at a location directed by the
21 county commissioners to provide additional information on the matter to members of the
22 public located adjacent to or in proximity to mining areas or affected areas.

24 affected by §33, is amended to read:
25 2. Imminent endangerment. If the department determines that a violation under
26 subsection 1 mining operation is causing or resulting in, or has the potential to cause or
27 result in, an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or safety,
28 environment or natural resources, regardless of whether a violation under subsection 1
29 exists, the department shall take action necessary to prevent, abate or eliminate the
30 endangerment. Such action may include one or more of the following:
31 A. Revoking the mining permit as authorized by section 342, subsection 11‑B;
32 B. Issuing an order to the permittee requiring immediate suspension of mining
33 activities, including, but not limited to, the removal of metallic product from the site;
34 C. Issuing an order to the permittee to undertake such other corrective or response

37 SUMMARY
3388 This bill provides a number of amendments to the Maine Metallic Mineral Mining Act,
3399 including the following.
40 1. In addition to other requirements provided under current law, the bill requires an
41 applicant for a mining permit to:
Page 6 - 132LR2210(01)

1 A. Submit a human health impact assessment for the proposed mining operation that
2 identifies all potential emissions and effects from the mining operation in a proposed
3 mining area and affected area that can reasonably be expected to cause or threaten harm
4 to human health and to particularly vulnerable populations. The assessment must
5 include a baseline health data evaluation for the population surrounding the mining
6 operation;
7 B. Demonstrate specific plans to provide for and fund the perpetual treatment and
8 monitoring of mine waste and tailings in the event that the applicant fails to satisfy
9 applicable mine waste or tailings management requirements, applicable closure and
10 post-closure monitoring requirements or other applicable requirements resulting in the
11 need for perpetual treatment of mine waste or tailings following closure;
12 C. Demonstrate specific plans to address natural events that may affect mining
13 operations and for the implementation of climate adaptation measures as specified by
14 rule; and
15 D. Demonstrate specific plans for ensuring that the mining operation will use clean
16 energy measures and technologies to the greatest extent practicable.
17 2. In addition to other restrictions provided under current law, the bill prohibits the
18 Department of Environmental Protection from issuing a mining permit for a mining
19 operation that:
20 A. Will involve or result in the release of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl
21 substances into the air, soil, groundwater or surface water within any mining area or
22 affected area;
23 B. Will involve the use of explosives or other blasting materials that contain
24 perchlorate; or
25 C. Does not meet all applicable setback requirements specified in rule, which must
26 include, but are not limited to, minimum setbacks from schools, day care facilities,
27 residences, hospitals, national and state parks, elder care facilities, community gardens,
28 churches, locations considered sacred by federally recognized Indian tribes, nations or
29 bands in the State, water bodies and wildlife refuges.
30 3. In addition to other requirements provided under current law, the bill requires a
31 mining permittee to:
32 A. Comply with applicable air quality standards and requirements through direct
33 measurement of emissions and not by estimating emissions concentrations; to conduct
34 air emissions monitoring for the pollutants described in the State's ambient air quality
35 standards laws and for other hazardous air pollutants specified in rule; to install and
36 operate fenceline monitoring equipment for air emissions from any stack, flue,
37 chimney, vent or other potential source of air pollution within a mining area; and to
38 ensure the monitoring and measurement of fugitive emissions to the air within a mining
39 area; and
40 B. Provide proof of and maintain comprehensive general liability insurance for the
41 mining operation for the same duration as financial assurance is required by law, which
42 must provide sufficient coverage to address potential harm to members of the public
43 located adjacent to or in proximity to mining areas or affected areas.
Page 7 - 132LR2210(01)

1 4. The bill amends the provisions of the mining law regarding imminent endangerment
2 to provide the department with authority to take action necessary to prevent an imminent
3 and substantial endangerment to the public health or safety, environment or natural
4 resources that a mining operation has the potential to cause or result in, regardless of
5 whether a violation exists.
6 5. The bill amends certain definitions within the mining law and makes other
7 associated changes to the mining law to provide for the regulation of smelting or refining
8 activities and facilities that are part of the mining operation. If a mining operation involves
9 on-site smelting or refining activities or facilities, if mine waste or other materials resulting
10 from those activities is removed for off-site storage or disposal, the permittee must conduct
11 post-closure groundwater monitoring at any location where the mine waste or other
12 materials are stored or disposed.
13 6. The bill amends permittee notification requirements to require the provision of
14 information to communities surrounding a mining operation regarding air emissions and
15 other fugitive emissions, material safety data for all chemicals and substances used in the
16 mining operation and the results of studies or modeling regarding the mining operation. At
17 the request of a surrounding community that receives such information, the permittee must
18 attend a public meeting to provide additional information.
