Sec. 1. Alternative nursing facility locations. Resolved: That the Department
of Health and Human Services shall amend its rules in Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits
Manual, Chapter II, Section 67, Nursing Facility Services, to allow for the placement of a
MaineCare member, when the member is being discharged from a hospital to a nursing
facility placement, in a nursing facility that is greater than 60 miles from the member's
residence under the following conditions.
1. For placements that are beyond 60 miles from the member's residence but not more
than 100 miles from the member's residence, the hospital must have attempted to find a
placement that is within a 60-mile radius of the member's residence and those efforts,
including refusals by facilities, must be documented.
2. For placements beyond 60 miles of the member's residence, the member must be
provided with information, including written materials and contact information, about the
long-term care ombudsman program in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, section
5107-A for use by the member if the member determines, at any point, that a closer
placement is desired.
3. For placements beyond 100 miles from the member's residence, the member or
member's guardian must consent to the placement.
