6 SUMMARY
77 This bill provides that the Maine Emergency Medical Services Act of 1982 may not be
88 construed to prohibit a person licensed as an emergency medical services person from
99 rendering medical services in a hospital or other health care facility setting if those services
1100 are rendered in the person's capacity as an employee, volunteer or contracted agent of the
1111 hospital or health care facility and certain other conditions are met. Current law requires
1122 such a person to render those services in the person's capacity as an employee of the hospital
1133 or health care facility in order for the exemption provision to apply.
