8 3. Violation. The board shall process any violation of this section in the manner
9 provided in section 3906.
10 §3905. Prevention of prohibited acts
11 1. Prevention of prohibited acts; board powers. The board may prevent an
12 agricultural employer, agricultural employee or other person from engaging in a prohibited
13 act under section 3904 in accordance with this section.
14 2. Complaints. An agricultural employer or an agricultural employee that believes
15 that an agricultural employer, agricultural employee or any other person has engaged in or
16 is engaging in a prohibited act under section 3904 may file a complaint with the executive
17 director stating the charges. The complaint may not be filed with the executive director
18 until the complaining party has served a copy of the complaint upon the party named in the
19 complaint. On receipt of a complaint, the executive director or the executive director's
20 designee shall review the complaint to determine whether the facts as alleged constitute a
21 prohibited act under section 3904. If it is determined that the facts do not, as a matter of
22 law, constitute a violation of this chapter, the complaint must be dismissed by the executive
23 director, subject to review by the board. If the executive director or the board determines
24 that a formal hearing is necessary, the executive director must serve upon the parties to the
25 complaint a notice of the prehearing conference and of the hearing before the board. The
26 notice must include the time and place of hearing for the prehearing conference or the
27 hearing, as appropriate. A hearing may not be held based upon an alleged prohibited act
28 occurring more than 6 months before the filing of the complaint with the executive director.
29 The party named in the complaint has the right to file a written answer to the complaint and
30 to appear in person or by other means and give testimony at the place and time fixed for
31 the hearing. In the discretion of the board, any other person or organization may be allowed
32 to intervene in the proceeding and to present testimony. This subsection does not restrict
33 the right of the board to require the executive director or the executive director's designee
34 to hold a prehearing conference on any prohibited act complaint prior to the hearing before
35 the board and to take an action, including dismissal, to attempt to resolve disagreements
36 between the parties or to recommend an order to the board, when the executive director
37 determines appropriate, subject to review by the board.
38 3. Cease and desist order. If after hearing and argument and upon a preponderance
39 of the evidence received the board is of the opinion that a party named in the complaint has
40 engaged in or is engaging in a prohibited act under section 3904, the board shall state in
41 writing its findings of fact and the reasons for its conclusions and issue and cause to be
42 served upon that party an order requiring the party to cease and desist from the prohibited
43 act and to take affirmative action, including reinstatement of agricultural employees with
44 or without back pay and making agricultural employees whole for the loss of pay resulting
45 from the agricultural employer's prohibited act, and to provide other relief. An order of the
Page 3 - 132LR0198(01)

416 board may not require the reinstatement of an individual as an agricultural employee who
427 has been suspended or discharged for cause or the payment to the agricultural employee of
438 any back pay if the individual was suspended or discharged for cause.
4 4. Dismissal of complaint. If after hearing and argument and upon a preponderance
5 of the evidence received the board is not of the opinion that a party named in the complaint
6 has engaged in or is engaging in any prohibited act under section 3904, the board shall state
7 in writing its findings of fact and the reasons for its conclusions and issue an order
8 dismissing the complaint.
9 5. Enforcement action; scope of review; consolidation of actions. If after the
10 issuance of an order by the board requiring a party to cease and desist or to take any other
11 affirmative action the party fails to comply with the order of the board, the party in whose
12 favor the order operates or the board may file a civil action in Superior Court to compel
13 compliance with the order of the board. Upon application of a party in interest or the board,
14 the Superior Court may grant temporary relief or a restraining order and may impose terms
15 and conditions as determined just and proper. The board's decision may not be stayed
16 except when it is clearly shown to the satisfaction of the Superior Court that substantial and
17 irreparable injury is likely to be sustained or that there is a substantial risk of danger to the
18 public health or safety. In an action to compel compliance, the Superior Court may not
19 review the action of the board other than to determine whether the board has acted in excess
20 of its jurisdiction. If an action to review the decision of the board is pending at the time of
21 the commencement of an action for enforcement pursuant to this subsection or is filed later,
22 the enforcement action and the request for review of a board decision in the Superior Court
23 must be consolidated.
24 6. Review. Either party may seek a review by the Superior Court of a decision or order
25 of the board by filing a complaint in accordance with the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure,
26 Rule 80C within 15 days of the date of issuance of the board's decision. The complaint
27 must be served upon the board and all parties to the board proceeding by certified mail,
28 return receipt requested. Upon the filing of the complaint, the Superior Court shall schedule
29 the hearing and notify all parties in interest and the board. Pending review and upon
30 application of a party in interest, the Superior Court may grant temporary relief or a
31 restraining order and impose terms and conditions that the Superior Court determines just
32 and proper, including back pay and compensation for actual and consequential losses,
33 except that the board's decision or order is not stayed unless it is clearly shown to the
34 satisfaction of the Superior Court that substantial and irreparable injury will be sustained
35 or that there is a substantial risk of danger to the public health or safety. The executive
36 director shall immediately file in the Superior Court the record in the proceeding certified
37 by the executive director or a member of the board. The record must include all documents
38 filed in the proceeding and the transcript, if any. A hearing must be held after notice, and
39 after the hearing the Superior Court may enforce, modify, enforce as modified or set aside
40 in whole or in part the decision or order of the board, except that the findings of the board
41 on questions of fact are final unless shown to be clearly erroneous. An appeal to the
42 Supreme Judicial Court must be the same as an appeal from an interlocutory order under
43 section 6.
44 7. Privileges seeking injunctive relief. In a judicial proceeding authorized by this
45 section in which injunctive relief is sought, subsections 5 and 6 apply, except that an
Page 4 - 132LR0198(01)

416 allegation or proof of unavoidable substantial and irreparable injury to the complainant's
427 property is not required to obtain a temporary restraining order or injunction.
3 §3906. Hearings
4 1. Hearings; rules of evidence; evidence. Hearings conducted by the board must be
5 informal and the rules of evidence prevailing in judicial proceedings are not binding. Any
6 documentary evidence and other evidence determined to be relevant by the board may be
7 received by the board.
8 2. Subpoenas; evidence; witness fees. The chair of the board may administer oaths
9 and require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the presentation of
10 books, records and other evidence relative or pertinent to the issues presented to the board
11 for determination. Witnesses subpoenaed by the board are allowed the same fees paid to
12 witnesses in the Superior Court. These fees, together with all necessary expenses of the
13 board, must be paid by the Treasurer of State on warrants drawn by the State Controller.
14 §3907. Federal precedents
15 The board shall consult precedents under the National Labor Relations Act, as
16 amended, as appropriate.
