12 SUMMARY
1133 This bill increases fees paid to a county register of deeds for certain services. It
1144 implements a flat fee of $45 for receiving, recording and indexing instruments that do not
1155 already have a specific fee set forth in statute and changes the fee for recording, indexing
1166 and preserving plans to $45. The bill also increases fees applicable to electronic or printed
1177 images and electronic abstracts from a county registry of deeds website and increases the
1188 surcharge a register of deeds may collect per document. It also increases the fees associated
1199 with downloads of 1,000 or more consecutive electronic images or abstracts from a county
2200 registry of deeds and prohibits the buyer from selling such images or abstracts to another
2211 person. The bill also repeals a $13 fee for requests for more than one previously recorded
2222 instrument. In current law, an annual report is required from the register of deeds for each
2233 county to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over state and
2244 local government matters on the amount of surcharge funds raised and expended and the
2255 use of those funds; the bill makes the report required only if requested by the committee.
