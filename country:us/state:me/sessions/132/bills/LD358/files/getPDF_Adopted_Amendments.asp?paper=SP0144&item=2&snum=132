2266 This amendment requires county registers of deeds to send an electronic or paper copy

3300 law. The amendment also clarifies that county registers of deeds may charge a reasonable
3311 fee for a paper copy provided.

33 instrument that may be recorded and for which a specific fee is not set forth in current law.
34 These fees are $25 per instrument recorded at the request of the State or a municipality and
35 $35 per instrument recorded at the request of all other persons.
36 The amendment removes the reference to electronic abstracts and changes from 5¢ to
37 25¢ per image the cost for acquiring downloads of 1,000 or more consecutive electronic
38 images from a county registry of deeds that is equipped to and voluntarily agrees to provide
39 downloads of 1,000 or more consecutive electronic images pursuant to a written agreement
40 with the person requesting the downloads. The amendment also removes from the bill the
41 prohibition that a person acquiring downloads of 1,000 or more consecutive electronic
42 images from a county registry of deeds may not sell such images to another person.
