packages of cigarettes as evidence of the payment of the tax imposed by this chapter. The
assessor may permit a licensed distributor to pay for the stamps within 30 days after the
date of purchase, if a bond satisfactory to the assessor in an amount not less than 50% of
the sale price of the stamps has been filed with the assessor conditioned upon payment for
the stamps. Such a distributor may continue to purchase stamps on a 30-day deferral basis
only if it remains current with its cigarette tax obligations. The assessor may not sell
additional stamps to a distributor that has failed to pay in full within 30 days for stamps
previously purchased until such time as the overdue payment is received. The assessor
shall sell cigarette stamps to licensed distributors at the following discounts from their face
value:
D. For stamps at the face value of 175 mills, the discount rate is 0.66%.
Sec. 4. Effective date. This Act takes effect April 1, 2026.
