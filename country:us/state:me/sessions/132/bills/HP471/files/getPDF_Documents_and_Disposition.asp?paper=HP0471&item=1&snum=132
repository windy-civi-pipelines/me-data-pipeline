JOINT RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING FEBRUARY 2025 AS
NATIONAL PARENT LEADERSHIP MONTH
WHEREAS, partnering with parents is a critical and effective way to help families identify
and build upon their strengths and prevent child abuse and neglect; and
WHEREAS, authentic partnerships with parents are created when parents have the
opportunity to partner with other parents and present a "parent perspective and lens" to inform
policies and programs that support the growth of the protective factors that lead to strong
families and communities; and
WHEREAS, the Maine Children's Trust, a statewide abuse and neglect prevention
organization, supports, encourages and acknowledges partnerships between parents and
community stakeholders, leaders and policymakers as critical to developing strong
communities; and
WHEREAS, partnerships with parents can help with building strengths-based
communities that thrive based on protective factors; and
WHEREAS, partnerships with parents are successfully achieved when parents are partners
in the planning, implementation, oversight and evaluation of policies, practices and programs
that affect families and communities, receive support and training and have multiple
opportunities to share their expertise; and
WHEREAS, parents each year are partnering with other parents to build stronger, safer
communities where all children can thrive; and
WHEREAS, parents can have a powerful effect on communities by sharing their lived
expertise, and they will continue to have a positive effect on the lives of families across the
State; and
WHEREAS, many organizations across the State support and provide partnership
opportunities for parents; and
WHEREAS, National Parent Leadership Month is an opportunity to recognize, honor and
celebrate these parents and their contributions; now, therefore, be it
RESOLVED: that We, the Members of the One Hundred and Thirty-second Legislature
now assembled in the First Regular Session, on behalf of the people we represent, take this
opportunity to recognize February 2025 as Parent Leadership Month in order to raise awareness
of the vital role parents play in creating local communities that produce thriving children.
