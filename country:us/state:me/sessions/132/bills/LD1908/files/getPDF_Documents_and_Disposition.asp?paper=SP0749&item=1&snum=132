3366 This bill requires that, beginning January 1, 2026, an original equipment manufacturer
3377 of digital electronic equipment sold or in use in the State on or after July 1, 2021 is required
3388 to make available on fair and reasonable terms to any independent repair provider or owner
3399 of the digital electronic equipment any documentation, parts or tools required for the
4400 diagnosis, maintenance or repair of the equipment. Under the bill, an independent repair
4411 provider is a business engaged in diagnosing, maintaining and repairing digital electronic
4422 equipment but is not the original equipment manufacturer or a business licensed by the
4433 original equipment manufacturer.
Page 6 - 132LR1519(01)
1 The bill also prohibits original equipment manufacturers, beginning January 1, 2026,
2 from using software to identify component parts through a unique identifier, also called
3 "parts pairing," to prevent or inhibit an owner or independent repair facility from installing
4 or enabling functional replacement parts or components; intentionally reduce the
5 functionality of the electronic equipment; or cause the electronic equipment to display
6 misleading alerts about unidentified parts that the user cannot immediately dismiss. This
7 provision applies to consumer electronic equipment that is manufactured for the first time,
8 and first sold or used in this State, after January 1, 2026.
9 The bill includes several exceptions that limit an original equipment manufacturer's
10 obligations under the bill. The bill provides that an original equipment manufacturer is not
11 liable for damages resulting from improper use of personal data or a data security breach
12 in connection with repair, diagnosis, maintenance or modification of digital electronic
13 equipment by an independent repair provider or owner.
14 The bill requires that independent repair providers must provide a customer with a
15 written notice explaining that the independent repair provider is not an authorized repair
16 provider for the digital electronic equipment and disclose whether the independent repair
17 provider uses any used parts in performing repair work.

1 3. Additional limitations and exclusions. Notwithstanding any provision of this
2 section to the contrary:
3 A. An original equipment manufacturer is not required to:
4 (1) Provide or make available to an independent repair provider or owner
5 documentation, parts or tools if:
6 (a) The part or tool is no longer available to the original equipment
7 manufacturer; or
8 (b) The tool is used by the original equipment manufacturer only to perform
9 no-cost diagnostic services virtually through telephone, Internet, chat function,
10 e-mail or similar means that do not involve the manufacturer's physically
11 handling the owner's equipment, unless the manufacturer also makes that
12 documentation or tool available to persons unaffiliated with the manufacturer;
13 (2) Divulge any trade secret except as necessary to perform diagnosis,
14 maintenance or repair on fair and reasonable terms;
15 (3) Make available to an independent repair provider or owner documentation,
16 parts or tools that would disable, reset or override electronic privacy or security
17 locks or security-related measures or functions, or disable or override antitheft
18 security or privacy measures set by the owner of the equipment without the owner's
19 authorization. This subparagraph may not be construed to relieve the original

10 authorized 3rd-party provider to provide such documentation, parts or tools to an
11 independent repair provider or owner or to relieve an original equipment manufacturer
12 of its obligations to make available documentation, parts or tools to an independent
13 repair provider or owner; and
14 D. An original equipment manufacturer is not liable under this section for damages
15 resulting from improper use of personal data or any data privacy or security breach in
16 connection with repair, diagnosis, maintenance or modification of digital electronic
17 equipment by an independent repair provider or owner.

19 of any agreement between an original equipment manufacturer and an authorized repair
20 provider, including, but not limited to, the performance or provision of warranty or recall
21 repair work by an authorized repair provider on behalf of an original equipment
22 manufacturer pursuant to such an authorized repair agreement, except that any provision in
23 such an authorized repair agreement that purports to waive, avoid, restrict or limit an
24 original equipment manufacturer's compliance with this section is void and unenforceable.
25 4. Written notice required. Before repairing digital electronic equipment subject to
26 the requirements of this section, an independent repair provider shall provide to a customer
27 a written notice that contains the following information:
28 A. That the independent repair provider is not an authorized repair provider for the

35 SUMMARY
3366 This bill requires that, beginning January 1, 2026, an original equipment manufacturer
3377 of digital electronic equipment sold or in use in the State on or after July 1, 2021 is required
3388 to make available on fair and reasonable terms to any independent repair provider or owner
3399 of the digital electronic equipment any documentation, parts or tools required for the
4400 diagnosis, maintenance or repair of the equipment. Under the bill, an independent repair
4411 provider is a business engaged in diagnosing, maintaining and repairing digital electronic
4422 equipment but is not the original equipment manufacturer or a business licensed by the
4433 original equipment manufacturer.
Page 6 - 132LR1519(01)

1 The bill also prohibits original equipment manufacturers, beginning January 1, 2026,
2 from using software to identify component parts through a unique identifier, also called
3 "parts pairing," to prevent or inhibit an owner or independent repair facility from installing
4 or enabling functional replacement parts or components; intentionally reduce the
5 functionality of the electronic equipment; or cause the electronic equipment to display
6 misleading alerts about unidentified parts that the user cannot immediately dismiss. This
7 provision applies to consumer electronic equipment that is manufactured for the first time,
8 and first sold or used in this State, after January 1, 2026.
9 The bill includes several exceptions that limit an original equipment manufacturer's
10 obligations under the bill. The bill provides that an original equipment manufacturer is not
11 liable for damages resulting from improper use of personal data or a data security breach
12 in connection with repair, diagnosis, maintenance or modification of digital electronic
13 equipment by an independent repair provider or owner.
14 The bill requires that independent repair providers must provide a customer with a
15 written notice explaining that the independent repair provider is not an authorized repair
16 provider for the digital electronic equipment and disclose whether the independent repair
17 provider uses any used parts in performing repair work.
