28 violation of the home-sharing agreement for which the tenant is being evicted;
29 B. No later than 7 days following notice of eviction by the landlord pursuant to
30 paragraph A, the tenant must vacate the premises; and
31 C. A tenant who fails to vacate the premises within 7 days following the notice of
32 eviction pursuant to paragraph A is deemed a trespasser without right, and the tenant's

3377 This bill establishes an expedited eviction process for a landlord participating in a
3388 home-sharing agreement. "Home-sharing agreement" is defined as an agreement made

4400 residence and a tenant who leases a room in that residence. A home-sharing agreement is
Page 1 - 132LR1241(01)
411 deemed a tenancy at will. The bill provides for the landlord to require eviction within 7
422 days of written notice. Failure of the tenant to comply within 7 days results in the tenant
433 being declared a trespasser without right and allows the landlord to seek assistance from a
444 sheriff or law enforcement officer to evict the tenant.
