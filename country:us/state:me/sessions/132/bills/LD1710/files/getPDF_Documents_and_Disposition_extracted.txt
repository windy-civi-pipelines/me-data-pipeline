2 an escape from custody or to enforce a rule of the Department of Corrections or a jail;
3 or
4 B. In self-defense or to defend a 3rd person from what the individual reasonably
5 believes to be the imminent use of unlawful nondeadly force encountered while seeking
6 to prevent an escape or enforce a rule as described in paragraph A.
7 2. A corrections officer, corrections supervisor, transport officer or law enforcement
8 officer responsible for the custody, care, treatment or transport of persons in custody

10 the circumstances.
