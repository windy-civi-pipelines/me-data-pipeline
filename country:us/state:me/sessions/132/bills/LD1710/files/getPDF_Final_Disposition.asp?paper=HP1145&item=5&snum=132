person reasonably believes such force to be necessary to carry out the officer's or
supervisor's direction, unless the private person reasonably believes the order is illegal;
or
B. Deadly force only when the private person reasonably believes such force to be
necessary for self-defense or to defend a 3rd person from what the private person
reasonably believes to be the imminent use of unlawful deadly force or when the officer
or supervisor directs the private person to use deadly force and the private person
reasonably believes the officer or supervisor is authorized to use deadly force under
the circumstances.
5. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, a corrections officer
or corrections supervisor is not justified in using nondeadly or deadly force, or in directing
a private person in the use of such force, in accordance with this section unless the
corrections officer or corrections supervisor has received in-service training pursuant to

person to use such force, in the setting in which the force is to be used.
