38 prohibit unlawful discrimination against consumers;
39 C. When the controller, under the circumstances, has actual knowledge or willfully
40 disregards that the consumer is at least 13 years of age but has not attained 16 years of
41 age:
Page 10 - 132LR2064(03)

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
1 (1) Process the personal data of the consumer for purposes of targeted advertising;
2 or
3 (2) Sell the consumer's personal data without the consumer's consent; or
4 D. Retaliate against a consumer for exercising a consumer right in this chapter or for
5 not agreeing to the collection or processing of personal data for a separate product or
6 service, including by denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for
7 goods or services or providing a different level of quality of goods or services to the
8 consumer.
9 4. Loyalty and rewards programs. Subsection 3 may not be construed to require a
10 controller to provide a product or service that requires the personal data of a consumer that
11 the controller does not collect or maintain or prohibit a controller from offering a different
12 rate, level, quality or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods
13 or services for no fee, if the offering is in connection with a consumer's voluntary
14 participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts or club card
15 program.
16 5. Privacy notice. A controller shall provide consumers with an accessible, clear and
17 meaningful privacy notice in plain language that is understandable by a reasonable
18 consumer that includes:
19 A. The categories of personal data processed by the controller;
20 B. The purpose for processing personal data;
21 C. How consumers may exercise their consumer rights, including how a consumer
22 may appeal a controller's decision with regard to the consumer's request;
23 D. The categories of personal data that the controller shares with 3rd parties, if any;
24 E. The categories of 3rd parties, if any, with which the controller shares personal data;
25 and
26 F. An active e-mail address or other mechanism that the consumer may use to contact
27 the controller.
28 6. Consumer rights request mechanism. A controller shall establish, and shall
29 describe in a privacy notice, one or more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit
30 a request to exercise a consumer right pursuant to this chapter. The design of the secure
31 and reliable means must take into account the ways in which consumers normally interact
32 with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication of requests and the
33 ability of the controller to verify the identity of the consumer making the request. A
34 controller may not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise a
35 consumer right, but may require a consumer to use an existing account.
36 7. Notice of sale and targeted advertising; opt-out mechanism. If a controller sells
37 personal data to a 3rd party or processes personal data for targeted advertising, the
38 controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose such processing, as well as the manner
39 in which a consumer may exercise the right to opt out of such processing. The disclosure
40 required under this section must include:
41 A. A clear and conspicuous link titled "Do Not Sell My Personal Data" or bearing a
42 substantially similar title on the controller's publicly accessible website that directs the
Page 11 - 132LR2064(03)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
413 consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to a publicly accessible website that enables
424 the consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to opt out of the sale of the consumer's
435 personal data; and
4 B. A clear and conspicuous link titled "Opt Me Out of Targeted Advertising" or
5 bearing a substantially similar title on the controller's publicly accessible website that
6 directs the consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to a publicly accessible website that
7 enables the consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to opt out of processing of the
8 consumer's personal data for targeted advertising.
9 In lieu of providing the 2 links described in paragraphs A and B, a controller may satisfy
10 the requirements of this subsection by providing a single conspicuous and clearly labeled
11 link on the controller's publicly accessible website that allows a consumer, or an agent of
12 the consumer, both to opt out of the sale of the consumer's personal data and to opt out of
13 the processing of the consumer's personal data for targeted advertising. If the controller
14 maintains a specific section or page of its publicly accessible website that allows a
15 consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to opt out of the sale of the consumer's data or the
16 processing of the consumer's data for targeted advertising and to select additional privacy
17 controls, the controller may satisfy the requirements of this subsection by providing a single
18 conspicuous and clearly labeled link on the controller's publicly accessible website titled
19 "Your Privacy Choices" or bearing a substantially similar title that directs the consumer, or
20 an agent of the consumer, to that specific section or page of its publicly accessible website.
21 8. Universal opt-out mechanism. No later than December 1, 2027, a controller shall
22 allow a consumer to opt out of any processing of the consumer's personal data for the
23 purposes of targeted advertising or any sale of personal data through an opt-out preference
24 signal sent, with the consumer's consent, by a platform, technology or mechanism to the
25 controller indicating the consumer's intent to opt out of any such processing or sale. The
26 platform, technology or mechanism:
27 A. Must be consumer-friendly and easy to use by the average consumer;
28 B. May not unfairly disadvantage another controller;
29 C. May not make use of a default setting but must require the consumer to make an
30 affirmative, freely given and unambiguous choice to opt out of any such processing or
31 sale of the consumer's personal data;
32 D. Must be as consistent as possible with another similar platform, technology or
33 mechanism required by federal or state law; and
34 E. Must enable the controller to reasonably determine whether the consumer is a
35 resident of this State and whether the consumer has made a legitimate request to opt
36 out of to the sale of the consumer's personal data or targeted advertising.
37 A controller that recognizes an opt-out preference signal that has been approved by the
38 laws or regulations of another state is in compliance with this subsection.
39 §9607. Responsibilities of processors and controllers
40 1. Processor responsibilities. A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a
41 controller and shall assist the controller in meeting the controller's obligations under this
42 chapter. Assistance provided under this section must include:
Page 12 - 132LR2064(03)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
1 A. Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the
2 processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, so far as is reasonably
3 practicable, to fulfill the controller's obligation to respond to a consumer rights request;
4 B. Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the
5 processor, by assisting the controller in meeting the controller's obligations in relation
6 to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to the notification of a
7 breach of security, as required by chapter 210-B, of the system of the processor, in
8 order to meet the controller's obligations; and
9 C. Providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document
10 data protection assessments.
11 2. Contractual requirements. A contract between a controller and a processor must
12 govern the processor's data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on
13 behalf of the controller. The contract must clearly set forth instructions for processing data,
14 the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of
15 processing and the rights and obligations of both parties. The contract must require that
16 the processor:
17 A. Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of
18 confidentiality with respect to the data;
19 B. At the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller as
20 requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data
21 is required by law;
22 C. On the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all
23 information in the processor's possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's
24 compliance with the obligations in this chapter;
25 D. Allow and cooperate with reasonable assessments by the controller or the
26 controller's designated assessor or arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to
27 conduct an assessment of the processor's policies and technical and organizational
28 measures in support of the obligations in this chapter, using an appropriate and
29 accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for the assessment.
30 The processor shall provide a report of the assessment to the controller upon request;
31 and
32 E. Engage a subcontractor pursuant to a written contract that requires the subcontractor
33 to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data.
34 3. Processing relationship liability. This section may not be construed to relieve a
35 controller or processor from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by virtue
36 of the controller's or processor's role in the processing relationship as described in this
37 chapter.
38 4. Fact-based determination. Determining whether a person is acting as a controller
39 or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that
40 depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed. A person who is not
41 limited in the person's processing of personal data pursuant to a controller's instructions, or
42 who fails to adhere to the instructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to a
43 specific processing of data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's
44 instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If
Page 13 - 132LR2064(03)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
415 a processor begins, alone or jointly with other persons, determining the purposes and means
426 of the processing of personal data, the processor acts as a controller with respect to the
437 processing and may be subject to an enforcement action under section 9611.
4 §9608. Data protection assessments
5 1. Documentation. A controller shall conduct and document a data protection
6 assessment for each of the controller's processing activities that presents a heightened risk
7 of harm to a consumer. For the purposes of this section, "processing activity that presents
8 a heightened risk of harm to a consumer" includes:
9 A. The processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising;
10 B. The sale of personal data;
11 C. The processing of personal data for the purposes of profiling, when profiling
12 presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:
13 (1) Unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on, consumers;
14 (2) Financial, physical or reputational injury to consumers;
15 (3) A physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the private
16 affairs or concerns, of consumers, when the intrusion would be offensive to a
17 reasonable person; or
18 (4) Other substantial injury to consumers; and
19 D. The processing of sensitive data.
20 2. Required elements. Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection
21 1 must identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and indirectly, from the
22 processing to the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders and the public against the
23 potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with the processing, as mitigated by
24 safeguards that can be employed by the controller to reduce the risks. The controller shall
25 factor into the data protection assessment the use of de-identified data and the reasonable
26 expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the processing and the relationship
27 between the controller and the consumer whose personal data will be processed.
28 3. Attorney General disclosure; exemption from public records. The Attorney
29 General may require that a controller disclose a data protection assessment that is relevant
30 to an investigation conducted by the Attorney General, and the controller shall make the
31 data protection assessment available to the Attorney General. The Attorney General may
32 evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in
33 this chapter. A data protection assessment is confidential and exempt from disclosure under
34 Title 1, chapter 13. To the extent information contained in a data protection assessment
35 disclosed to the Attorney General includes information subject to attorney-client privilege
36 or work product protection, the disclosure does not constitute a waiver of that privilege or
37 protection.
38 4. Processing activity. A single data protection assessment may address a comparable
39 set of processing operations that include similar activities.
40 5. Reciprocity. If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose
41 of complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection assessment
42 satisfies the requirements established in this section if the data protection assessment is
Page 14 - 132LR2064(03)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
413 reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data protection assessment that would
424 otherwise be conducted pursuant to this section.
3 6. Application. A controller is not required to conduct a data protection assessment
4 under this section for any processing activity created or initiated before July 1, 2026.
5 §9609. De-identified and pseudonymous data
6 1. De-identified data requirements. A controller in possession of de-identified data
7 shall:
8 A. Take reasonable measures to ensure that the data cannot be associated with an
9 individual;
10 B. Publicly commit to maintaining and using de-identified data without attempting to
11 re-identify the data; and
12 C. Contractually obligate recipients of the de-identified data to comply with all
13 provisions of this chapter.
14 2. De-identified data and pseudonymous re-identification of data. This chapter
15 may not be construed to require a controller or processor to:
16 A. Re-identify de-identified data or pseudonymous data; or
17 B. Maintain data in identifiable form, or collect, obtain, retain or access data or
18 technology, in order to be capable of associating an authenticated consumer request
19 with personal data.
20 3. Consumer requests. This chapter may not be construed to require a controller or
21 processor to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request if the controller:
22 A. Is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal data, or it
23 would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request with the
24 personal data;
25 B. Does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the consumer who is the
26 subject of the personal data, or associate the personal data with other personal data
27 about the same consumer; and
28 C. Does not sell the personal data to a 3rd party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the
29 personal data to a 3rd party other than a processor, except as otherwise permitted in
30 this section.
31 4. Pseudonymous data requirements. The rights afforded under section 9604,
32 subsection 1 do not apply to pseudonymous data in cases when the controller is able to
33 demonstrate that information necessary to identify the consumer is kept separately and is
34 subject to effective technical and organizational controls that prevent the controller from
35 accessing the information.
36 5. Contractual oversight. A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or de-
37 identified data shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with contractual
38 commitments to which the pseudonymous data or de-identified data is subject and shall
39 take appropriate steps to address breaches of those contractual commitments.
40 §9610. Controller and processor; duties and obligations
Page 15 - 132LR2064(03)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
1 1. Exempt controller and processor activities. This chapter may not be construed
2 to restrict a controller's or processor's ability to:
3 A. Comply with federal laws or regulations or the laws or rules of a state;
4 B. Comply with a civil, criminal or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena or
5 summons by federal or state governmental authorities or governmental authorities of a
6 federally recognized Indian tribe in this State;
7 C. Cooperate with federal, tribal or state law enforcement agencies concerning conduct
8 or activity that the controller or processor reasonably and in good faith believes may
9 violate federal laws or regulations or the laws and rules of a state;
10 D. Investigate, establish, exercise, prepare for or defend legal claims;
11 E. Provide a product or service specifically requested by a consumer;
12 F. Perform under a contract to which a consumer is a party, including fulfilling the
13 terms of a written warranty;
14 G. Take steps at the request of a consumer prior to entering into a contract;
15 H. Take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life or physical
16 safety of the consumer or another individual and when the processing cannot be
17 manifestly based on another legal basis;
18 I. Prevent, detect, protect against or respond to security incidents, identity theft, fraud,
19 harassment, malicious or deceptive activities or illegal activity or preserve the integrity
20 or security of systems or investigate, report or prosecute those responsible for an action
21 described in this paragraph;
22 J. Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific or statistical research in the public
23 interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws and is approved,
24 monitored and governed by an institutional review board that determines, or similar
25 independent oversight entities that determine:
26 (1) Whether the deletion of the information is likely to provide substantial benefits
27 that do not exclusively accrue to the controller;
28 (2) Whether the expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks; and
29 (3) Whether the controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate
30 privacy risks associated with research, including risks associated with
31 re-identification;
32 K. Assist another controller, processor or 3rd party with obligations under this chapter;
33 or
34 L. Process personal data for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, but
35 solely to the extent that the processing is:
36 (1) Subject to suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights of the
37 consumer whose personal data is being processed; and
38 (2) Under the responsibility of a professional subject to confidentiality obligations
39 under federal or state laws or local ordinances.
Page 16 - 132LR2064(03)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
1 2. Internal use. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this
2 chapter do not restrict a controller's or processor's ability to collect, use or retain data for
3 internal use to:
4 A. Conduct internal research to develop, improve or repair products, services or
5 technology;
6 B. Effectuate a product recall;
7 C. Identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality;
8 or
9 D. Perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the
10 consumer or reasonably anticipated based on the consumer's existing relationship with
11 the controller, or are otherwise compatible with processing data in furtherance of the
12 provision of a product or service specifically requested by a consumer or the
13 performance of a contract to which the consumer is a party.
14 3. Evidentiary privilege. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under
15 this chapter do not apply when compliance with this chapter by the controller or processor
16 would violate an evidentiary privilege under the laws of this State. This chapter may not
17 be construed to prevent a controller or processor from providing personal data concerning
18 a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of this State as
19 part of a privileged communication.
20 4. Liability. A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a 3rd-party
21 processor or 3rd-party controller in accordance with this chapter has not violated this
22 chapter if the 3rd-party processor or 3rd-party controller that receives and processes the
23 personal data violates this chapter, as long as, at the time the disclosing controller or
24 processor disclosed the personal data, the disclosing controller or processor did not have
25 actual knowledge that the receiving 3rd-party processor or 3rd-party controller would
26 violate this chapter. A 3rd-party controller or 3rd-party processor receiving personal data
27 from a controller or processor in compliance with this chapter is likewise not in violation
28 of this chapter for the transgressions of the controller or processor from which the 3rd-party
29 controller or 3rd-party processor receives the personal data.
30 5. Exemptions. This chapter may not be construed to:
31 A. Impose an obligation on a controller or processor that adversely affects the rights
32 or freedoms of a person, including, but not limited to, the rights of a person:
33 (1) To freedom of speech or freedom of the press guaranteed in the United States
34 Constitution, Amendment I; or
35 (2) Under Title 16, section 61; or
36 B. Apply to a person's processing of personal data in the course of the person's purely
37 personal or household activities.
38 6. Limitations. Personal data processed by a controller or processor pursuant to this
39 section may be processed only to the extent that the processing is:
40 A. Reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section; and
41 B. Adequate, relevant and limited to what is reasonably necessary in relation to the
42 specific purposes listed in this section. Personal data collected, used or retained
Page 17 - 132LR2064(03)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
413 pursuant to subsection 2 must, when applicable, take into account the nature and
424 purpose of the collection, use or retention. The data must be subject to reasonable
435 administrative, technical and physical measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity
446 and accessibility of the personal data and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of
457 harm to consumers relating to the collection, use or retention of personal data.
6 7. Controller burden. If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an
7 exemption in this section, the controller bears the burden of demonstrating that the
8 processing qualifies for the exemption and complies with the limitations in subsection 6.
9 8. Clarification of roles. Processing personal data for the purposes expressly
10 identified in this section does not solely make a legal entity a controller with respect to the
11 processing.
12 §9611. Enforcement
13 1. Violation as unfair trade practice; exclusive Attorney General enforcement. A
14 violation of this chapter constitutes an unfair trade practice under the Maine Unfair Trade
15 Practices Act, except that the rulemaking provisions of Title 5, section 207, subsection 2
16 do not apply to this chapter and except as provided in subsections 2 and 3. The Attorney
17 General has the exclusive authority to enforce violations of this chapter under the Maine
18 Unfair Trade Practices Act.
19 2. Notice. Notwithstanding any provision of Title 5, section 209 to the contrary, at
20 least 30 days prior to commencement of any action under the Maine Unfair Trade Practices
21 Act to enforce this chapter, the Attorney General shall notify the person against whom an
22 action may be brought of the intended action and give the person an opportunity to cure the
23 alleged violation or violations. The Attorney General may bring an action pursuant to this
24 section only if the controller fails to cure one or more of the alleged violations described in
25 the notice within 30 days of receiving the notice.
26 3. No private right of action. Notwithstanding Title 5, section 213, this chapter may
27 not be construed as creating a private right of action under this chapter or any other
28 provision of law against any person based on a violation of any provision of this chapter or
29 any other law.
30 4. Preemption. This chapter supersedes and preempts any ordinance, resolution, rule
31 or other regulation adopted by a political subdivision of the State regarding the processing
32 of personal data by a controller or processor.
33 §9612. Maine Privacy Fund established
34 1. Establishment; purpose. The Maine Privacy Fund, referred to in this section as
35 the "fund," is established within the Department of the Attorney General as a nonlapsing
36 fund to providing funding for the staff and activities of the department necessary to enforce
37 the provisions of this chapter.
38 2. Administration. The Department of the Attorney General shall administer the
39 fund. The fund must be established and held separate and apart from any other funds or
40 money of the State or the department and must be used and administered exclusively for
41 purposes authorized in this section. The fund consists of:
42 A. Any civil penalties, attorney's fees or costs awarded to the State in an action brought
43 by the Attorney General to enforce a violation of this chapter;

13 SUMMARY
1144 This amendment, which is a minority report of the committee, replaces the bill.
15 The amendment enacts the Maine Consumer Data Privacy Act, which takes effect July
16 1, 2026. The Act regulates the collection, use, processing, disclosure, sale and deletion of
17 nonpublicly available personal data that is linked or reasonably linkable to an individual
18 who is a resident of the State, referred to in the Act as a "consumer," or that is linked or
19 reasonably linkable to an identifiable consumer's device, by a person that conducts business
20 in this State or that produces products or services targeted to residents of this State, referred
21 to in the Act as a "controller." Under the Act, a controller must limit the collection of
22 personal data to what is adequate, relevant and reasonably necessary in relation to the
23 purposes for which the controller processes that data, as disclosed in a privacy notice
24 specifying the categories of personal data processed by the controller, the purposes for
25 processing the personal data, the categories of personal data transferred to 3rd parties and
26 the categories of 3rd parties to whom personal data is shared. The controller must also
27 process the minimum amount of personal data reasonably necessary, adequate or relevant
28 for each disclosed processing purpose.
29 A consumer has the right, under the Act, to confirm whether a controller is processing
30 the consumer's personal data; to require the controller to correct inaccuracies in or delete
31 the consumer's personal data; to obtain a copy of the consumer's personal data; and to opt
32 out of the processing of the consumer's personal data for purposes of targeted advertising,
33 sale or profiling in furtherance of decisions about the consumer's access to financial or
34 lending services, housing, insurance, education, criminal justice, employment
35 opportunities, health care services and essential goods and services. The privacy notice
36 must describe how a consumer may exercise these rights. The controller must obtain the
37 affirmative, informed consent of a consumer before processing the consumer's sensitive
38 data, including data revealing the consumer's race or ethnic origins, religious beliefs,
39 medical history or mental or physical health conditions or diagnoses, sexual orientation or
40 citizenship or immigration status; genetic or biometric data; precise geolocation data; data
41 of a known child who has not attained 13 years of age; social security, driver's license or
42 nondriver identification card number; information that permits access to a consumer's
43 financial account; or data concerning the consumer's status as the victim of a crime. If the
44 controller knows that the consumer has not attained 13 years of age, the controller may not

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
415 process the consumer's data for any purpose without parental consent. If the controller
426 knows or willfully disregards that the consumer is at least 13 years of age but has not
437 attained 16 years of age, the controller may not process the consumer's data for targeted
448 advertising and must obtain the consumer's consent before processing the consumer's data
459 for sale.
6 The Act prohibits a controller from processing data in a manner that discriminates
7 against a person in violation of state or federal law. A controller is also prohibited from
8 retaliating against a consumer for exercising the consumer's rights under the Act, except
9 that a controller may offer different prices or selection of goods in connection with a
10 consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty or discount program. A controller
11 must establish, implement and maintain reasonable data security practices. Beginning July
12 1, 2026, if a controller engages in a data processing activity that presents a heightened risk
13 of harm to a consumer, including processing any data for targeted advertising, sale or
14 profiling or any processing of sensitive data, the controller must conduct and document a
15 data protection assessment to identify and weigh the benefits and potential risks of the
16 processing activity. The controller may be required to disclose the data protection
17 assessment to the Attorney General, who must keep it confidential, when the assessment is
18 relevant to an investigation conducted by the Attorney General.
19 The provisions of the Act do not apply to specifically enumerated persons, including
20 the State, political subdivisions of the State and federally recognized Indian tribes in the
21 State; financial institutions or their affiliates subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley
22 Act; state-licensed and authorized insurers; covered entities and business associates subject
23 to the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996; motor vehicle
24 dealer franchisees; nonprofits that do not receive any revenue from the sale of personal data
25 or that detect and prevent fraudulent insurance acts; and persons that both processed the
26 personal data of fewer than 25,000 consumers in the preceding calendar year and derived
27 no more than 25% of gross revenue from the sale of personal data. The Act also does not
28 apply to persons that controlled or processed the personal data for purposes other than
29 completing payment transactions of fewer than 100,000 consumers in the preceding
30 calendar year, except that, beginning January 1, 2028, this exception applies only to persons
31 that controlled or processed the personal data for purposes other than completing payment
32 transactions of fewer than 50,000 consumers in the preceding calendar year.
33 In addition, the provisions of the Act do not apply to specifically enumerated types of
34 data, including: nonpublic personal information regulated under the federal Gramm-Leach-
35 Bliley Act; health care information protected under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22,
36 section 1711-C; protected health information under the federal Health Insurance Portability
37 and Accountability Act of 1996; personal data regulated by the Family Educational Rights
38 and Privacy Act of 1974; data processed and maintained by the controller regarding an
39 applicant for employment or employee to the extent the data is collected and used within
40 the context of that role; and data necessary for the controller to administer benefits. The
41 Maine Consumer Data Privacy Act also does not prohibit controllers from engaging in
42 specifically enumerated activities, including complying with state or federal law;
43 complying with investigations or subpoenas from governmental authorities including the
44 Federal Government and the government of a state or a federally recognized Indian tribe
45 in the State; cooperating with federal, state or tribal law enforcement agencies; providing
46 a product or service specifically requested by the consumer; protecting life and physical

417 safety of consumers and preventing or responding to security incidents; and conducting
428 internal product research, effectuating a product recall or performing other internal
439 operations aligned with the expectations of a consumer.
4 Violations of the Act may be enforced exclusively by the Attorney General under the
5 Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act. The Attorney General is required to provide a potential
6 defendant with at least 30 days' notice prior to initiating an enforcement action, during
7 which time the potential defendant may cure any violation alleged in the notice. Any civil
8 penalties, attorney's fees or costs awarded to the State for a violation of the Act must be
9 deposited in the Maine Privacy Fund, which is established to provide funding for the
10 enforcement staff and activities of the Department of the Attorney General. The Act further
11 requires the Attorney General to submit a report by February 1, 2027 to the joint standing
12 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary matters regarding the
13 operation and implementation of the Act. The committee may report out legislation related
14 to the report to the 133rd Legislature in 2027.
15 The amendment also repeals the current law governing the privacy of broadband
16 Internet access service customer personal information because broadband Internet access
17 service providers are subject to the provisions of the Act.

12 §9604. Consumer rights
13 1. Consumer rights. A consumer has a right to:
14 A. Confirm whether or not a controller is processing the consumer's personal data and
15 to access that personal data, unless such confirmation or access would require the
16 controller to reveal a trade secret;
17 B. Correct inaccuracies in the consumer's personal data, taking into account the nature
18 of the personal data and the purposes of the processing of the consumer's personal data;
19 C. Delete personal data provided by, or obtained about, the consumer;
20 D. Obtain a copy of the consumer's personal data processed by the controller, in a
21 portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows the
22 consumer to transmit the data to another controller without hindrance, when the
23 processing is carried out by automated means, as long as the controller is not required
24 to reveal a trade secret; and
25 E. Opt out of the processing of the consumer's personal data for purposes of:
26 (1) Targeted advertising;
27 (2) The sale of personal data; or
28 (3) Profiling in furtherance of solely automated decisions that produce legal or
29 similarly significant effects concerning the consumer.
30 2. Exercise of consumer rights. A consumer may communicate and access the
31 information necessary to exercise rights under this section by a secure and reliable means
32 established by the controller and described to the consumer in the controller's privacy
33 notice. A consumer may designate an authorized agent in accordance with section 9605 to
34 exercise the rights of the consumer to opt out of the processing of the consumer's personal
35 data as specified in subsection 1, paragraph E, subparagraphs (1) and (2). In the case of
36 processing personal data of a consumer known to be a child, the parent or legal guardian
37 may exercise consumer rights on the child's behalf. In the case of processing personal data
38 concerning a consumer subject to a guardianship, conservatorship or other protective
39 arrangement, the guardian or the conservator of the consumer may exercise rights on the
40 consumer's behalf.

1 3. Responding to exercise of consumer rights. Except as otherwise provided in this
2 chapter, a controller shall comply with a request by a consumer to exercise the consumer's
3 rights authorized pursuant to this chapter as follows.
4 A. A controller shall respond to the consumer without undue delay, but not later than
5 the 45th day after receipt of the request. The controller may extend the response period
6 by 45 days when reasonably necessary considering the complexity and number of the
7 consumer's requests, as long as the controller informs the consumer of the extension
8 within the initial 45-day response period.
9 B. If a controller declines to take action regarding the consumer's request, the
10 controller shall inform the consumer without undue delay, but not later than the 45th
11 day after receipt of the request, of the justification for declining to take action and
12 instructions for how to appeal the decision.
13 C. The controller shall provide information in response to a consumer's request, free
14 of charge, once during any 12-month period. If requests from a consumer are
15 manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive, the controller may charge the consumer
16 a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request or
17 decline to act on the request. The controller bears the burden of demonstrating the
18 manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive nature of the request.
19 D. If a controller is unable to authenticate a request to exercise a right afforded under
20 subsection 1, using commercially reasonable efforts, the controller is not required to
21 comply with a request to initiate an action pursuant to this section and shall provide
22 notice to the consumer that the controller is unable to authenticate the request to
23 exercise the right until the consumer provides additional information reasonably
24 necessary to authenticate the consumer and the consumer's request to exercise the right.
25 E. A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other
26 than the consumer is in compliance with a consumer's request to delete that data
27 pursuant to subsection 1, paragraph C by:
28 (1) Retaining a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary for
29 the purpose of ensuring that the consumer's personal data remains deleted from the
30 controller's records and not using the retained data for any other purpose pursuant
31 to the provisions of this chapter; or
32 (2) Opting the consumer out of the processing of the personal data for any purpose
33 other than the purposes exempted from the provisions of this chapter.
34 4. Appeals. A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the
35 controller's inaction on a request within a reasonable period of time after the consumer's
36 receipt of the decision. The appeal process must be conspicuously available and similar to
37 the process for submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to this section. Not later than
38 the 60th day after receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of
39 action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the
40 reasons for the decisions. If the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the
41 consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or other method through which the
42 consumer may contact the Attorney General to submit a complaint.
43 §9605. Authorized agent
Page 9 - 132LR2064(03)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
1 A consumer may designate another person to serve as the consumer's authorized agent,
2 and act on the consumer's behalf, to opt out of the processing of the consumer's personal
3 data for the purposes specified in section 9604, subsection 1, paragraph E, subparagraphs
4 (1) and (2). The consumer may designate an authorized agent by way of, among other
5 methods, technology, including, but not limited to, an Internet link or a browser setting,
6 browser extension or global device setting, indicating the consumer's intent to opt out of
7 such processing. A controller shall comply with an opt-out request received from an
8 authorized agent if the controller is able to verify, using commercially reasonable efforts,
9 the identity of the consumer and the authorized agent's authority to act on the consumer's
10 behalf.
11 §9606. Actions of controllers
12 1. Data minimization. A controller must comply with the requirements of this
13 subsection.
14 A. A controller shall limit the collection of personal data to what is adequate, relevant
15 and reasonably necessary in relation to the purposes for which the data is processed, as
16 disclosed to the consumer.
17 B. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a controller may not process personal
18 data for purposes that are neither reasonably necessary for, nor compatible with, the
19 disclosed purposes for which the data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer, unless
20 the controller obtains the consumer's consent.
21 C. A controller shall process the minimum amount of personal data that is reasonably
22 necessary, adequate or relevant for each purpose for which data is processed, as
23 disclosed to the consumer.
24 2. Duties. A controller shall:
25 A. Establish, implement and maintain reasonable administrative, technical and
26 physical data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility
27 of personal data appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data;
28 B. In the case of the processing of sensitive data concerning a consumer known to be
29 a child, process the data in accordance with COPPA; and
30 C. Provide an effective mechanism for a consumer to revoke the consumer's consent
31 under this section that is at least as easy as the mechanism by which the consumer
32 provided the consumer's consent and, upon revocation of the consent, cease to process
33 the data as soon as practicable, but not later than 15 days after the receipt of the request.
34 3. Prohibitions. A controller may not:
35 A. Process sensitive data concerning a consumer unless the controller obtains the
36 consumer's consent;
37 B. Process personal data in violation of the laws of this State and federal laws that
38 prohibit unlawful discrimination against consumers;
39 C. When the controller, under the circumstances, has actual knowledge or willfully
40 disregards that the consumer is at least 13 years of age but has not attained 16 years of
41 age:
Page 10 - 132LR2064(03)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
1 (1) Process the personal data of the consumer for purposes of targeted advertising;
2 or
3 (2) Sell the consumer's personal data without the consumer's consent; or
4 D. Retaliate against a consumer for exercising a consumer right in this chapter or for
5 not agreeing to the collection or processing of personal data for a separate product or
6 service, including by denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for
7 goods or services or providing a different level of quality of goods or services to the
8 consumer.
9 4. Loyalty and rewards programs. Subsection 3 may not be construed to require a
10 controller to provide a product or service that requires the personal data of a consumer that
11 the controller does not collect or maintain or prohibit a controller from offering a different
12 rate, level, quality or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods
13 or services for no fee, if the offering is in connection with a consumer's voluntary
14 participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts or club card
15 program.
16 5. Privacy notice. A controller shall provide consumers with an accessible, clear and
17 meaningful privacy notice in plain language that is understandable by a reasonable
18 consumer that includes:
19 A. The categories of personal data processed by the controller;
20 B. The purpose for processing personal data;
21 C. How consumers may exercise their consumer rights, including how a consumer
22 may appeal a controller's decision with regard to the consumer's request;
23 D. The categories of personal data that the controller shares with 3rd parties, if any;
24 E. The categories of 3rd parties, if any, with which the controller shares personal data;
25 and
26 F. An active e-mail address or other mechanism that the consumer may use to contact
27 the controller.
28 6. Consumer rights request mechanism. A controller shall establish, and shall
29 describe in a privacy notice, one or more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit
30 a request to exercise a consumer right pursuant to this chapter. The design of the secure
31 and reliable means must take into account the ways in which consumers normally interact
32 with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication of requests and the
33 ability of the controller to verify the identity of the consumer making the request. A
34 controller may not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise a
35 consumer right, but may require a consumer to use an existing account.
36 7. Notice of sale and targeted advertising; opt-out mechanism. If a controller sells
37 personal data to a 3rd party or processes personal data for targeted advertising, the
38 controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose such processing, as well as the manner
39 in which a consumer may exercise the right to opt out of such processing. The disclosure
40 required under this section must include:
41 A. A clear and conspicuous link titled "Do Not Sell My Personal Data" or bearing a
42 substantially similar title on the controller's publicly accessible website that directs the
Page 11 - 132LR2064(03)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
413 consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to a publicly accessible website that enables
424 the consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to opt out of the sale of the consumer's
435 personal data; and
4 B. A clear and conspicuous link titled "Opt Me Out of Targeted Advertising" or
5 bearing a substantially similar title on the controller's publicly accessible website that
6 directs the consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to a publicly accessible website that
7 enables the consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to opt out of processing of the
8 consumer's personal data for targeted advertising.
9 In lieu of providing the 2 links described in paragraphs A and B, a controller may satisfy
10 the requirements of this subsection by providing a single conspicuous and clearly labeled
11 link on the controller's publicly accessible website that allows a consumer, or an agent of
12 the consumer, both to opt out of the sale of the consumer's personal data and to opt out of
13 the processing of the consumer's personal data for targeted advertising. If the controller
14 maintains a specific section or page of its publicly accessible website that allows a
15 consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to opt out of the sale of the consumer's data or the
16 processing of the consumer's data for targeted advertising and to select additional privacy
17 controls, the controller may satisfy the requirements of this subsection by providing a single
18 conspicuous and clearly labeled link on the controller's publicly accessible website titled
19 "Your Privacy Choices" or bearing a substantially similar title that directs the consumer, or
20 an agent of the consumer, to that specific section or page of its publicly accessible website.
21 8. Universal opt-out mechanism. No later than December 1, 2027, a controller shall
22 allow a consumer to opt out of any processing of the consumer's personal data for the
23 purposes of targeted advertising or any sale of personal data through an opt-out preference
24 signal sent, with the consumer's consent, by a platform, technology or mechanism to the
25 controller indicating the consumer's intent to opt out of any such processing or sale. The
26 platform, technology or mechanism:
27 A. Must be consumer-friendly and easy to use by the average consumer;
28 B. May not unfairly disadvantage another controller;
29 C. May not make use of a default setting but must require the consumer to make an
30 affirmative, freely given and unambiguous choice to opt out of any such processing or
31 sale of the consumer's personal data;
32 D. Must be as consistent as possible with another similar platform, technology or
33 mechanism required by federal or state law; and
34 E. Must enable the controller to reasonably determine whether the consumer is a
35 resident of this State and whether the consumer has made a legitimate request to opt
36 out of to the sale of the consumer's personal data or targeted advertising.
37 A controller that recognizes an opt-out preference signal that has been approved by the
38 laws or regulations of another state is in compliance with this subsection.
39 §9607. Responsibilities of processors and controllers
40 1. Processor responsibilities. A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a
41 controller and shall assist the controller in meeting the controller's obligations under this
42 chapter. Assistance provided under this section must include:
Page 12 - 132LR2064(03)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
1 A. Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the
2 processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, so far as is reasonably
3 practicable, to fulfill the controller's obligation to respond to a consumer rights request;
4 B. Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the
5 processor, by assisting the controller in meeting the controller's obligations in relation
6 to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to the notification of a
7 breach of security, as required by chapter 210-B, of the system of the processor, in
8 order to meet the controller's obligations; and
9 C. Providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document
10 data protection assessments.
11 2. Contractual requirements. A contract between a controller and a processor must
12 govern the processor's data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on
13 behalf of the controller. The contract must clearly set forth instructions for processing data,
14 the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of
15 processing and the rights and obligations of both parties. The contract must require that
16 the processor:
17 A. Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of
18 confidentiality with respect to the data;
19 B. At the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller as
20 requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data
21 is required by law;
22 C. On the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all
23 information in the processor's possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's
24 compliance with the obligations in this chapter;
25 D. Allow and cooperate with reasonable assessments by the controller or the
26 controller's designated assessor or arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to
27 conduct an assessment of the processor's policies and technical and organizational
28 measures in support of the obligations in this chapter, using an appropriate and
29 accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for the assessment.
30 The processor shall provide a report of the assessment to the controller upon request;
31 and
32 E. Engage a subcontractor pursuant to a written contract that requires the subcontractor
33 to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data.
34 3. Processing relationship liability. This section may not be construed to relieve a
35 controller or processor from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by virtue
36 of the controller's or processor's role in the processing relationship as described in this
37 chapter.
38 4. Fact-based determination. Determining whether a person is acting as a controller
39 or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that
40 depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed. A person who is not
41 limited in the person's processing of personal data pursuant to a controller's instructions, or
42 who fails to adhere to the instructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to a
43 specific processing of data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's
44 instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If
Page 13 - 132LR2064(03)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
415 a processor begins, alone or jointly with other persons, determining the purposes and means
426 of the processing of personal data, the processor acts as a controller with respect to the
437 processing and may be subject to an enforcement action under section 9611.
4 §9608. Data protection assessments
5 1. Documentation. A controller shall conduct and document a data protection
6 assessment for each of the controller's processing activities that presents a heightened risk
7 of harm to a consumer. For the purposes of this section, "processing activity that presents
8 a heightened risk of harm to a consumer" includes:
9 A. The processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising;
10 B. The sale of personal data;
11 C. The processing of personal data for the purposes of profiling, when profiling
12 presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:
13 (1) Unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on, consumers;
14 (2) Financial, physical or reputational injury to consumers;
15 (3) A physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the private
16 affairs or concerns, of consumers, when the intrusion would be offensive to a
17 reasonable person; or
18 (4) Other substantial injury to consumers; and
19 D. The processing of sensitive data.
20 2. Required elements. Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection
21 1 must identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and indirectly, from the
22 processing to the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders and the public against the
23 potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with the processing, as mitigated by
24 safeguards that can be employed by the controller to reduce the risks. The controller shall
25 factor into the data protection assessment the use of de-identified data and the reasonable
26 expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the processing and the relationship
27 between the controller and the consumer whose personal data will be processed.
28 3. Attorney General disclosure; exemption from public records. The Attorney
29 General may require that a controller disclose a data protection assessment that is relevant
30 to an investigation conducted by the Attorney General, and the controller shall make the
31 data protection assessment available to the Attorney General. The Attorney General may
32 evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in
33 this chapter. A data protection assessment is confidential and exempt from disclosure under
34 Title 1, chapter 13. To the extent information contained in a data protection assessment
35 disclosed to the Attorney General includes information subject to attorney-client privilege
36 or work product protection, the disclosure does not constitute a waiver of that privilege or
37 protection.
38 4. Processing activity. A single data protection assessment may address a comparable
39 set of processing operations that include similar activities.
40 5. Reciprocity. If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose
41 of complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection assessment
42 satisfies the requirements established in this section if the data protection assessment is
Page 14 - 132LR2064(03)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
413 reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data protection assessment that would
424 otherwise be conducted pursuant to this section.
3 6. Application. A controller is not required to conduct a data protection assessment
4 under this section for any processing activity created or initiated before July 1, 2026.
5 §9609. De-identified and pseudonymous data
6 1. De-identified data requirements. A controller in possession of de-identified data
7 shall:
8 A. Take reasonable measures to ensure that the data cannot be associated with an
9 individual;
10 B. Publicly commit to maintaining and using de-identified data without attempting to
11 re-identify the data; and
12 C. Contractually obligate recipients of the de-identified data to comply with all
13 provisions of this chapter.
14 2. De-identified data and pseudonymous re-identification of data. This chapter
15 may not be construed to require a controller or processor to:
16 A. Re-identify de-identified data or pseudonymous data; or
17 B. Maintain data in identifiable form, or collect, obtain, retain or access data or
18 technology, in order to be capable of associating an authenticated consumer request
19 with personal data.
20 3. Consumer requests. This chapter may not be construed to require a controller or
21 processor to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request if the controller:
22 A. Is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal data, or it
23 would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request with the
24 personal data;
25 B. Does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the consumer who is the
26 subject of the personal data, or associate the personal data with other personal data
27 about the same consumer; and
28 C. Does not sell the personal data to a 3rd party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the
29 personal data to a 3rd party other than a processor, except as otherwise permitted in
30 this section.
31 4. Pseudonymous data requirements. The rights afforded under section 9604,
32 subsection 1 do not apply to pseudonymous data in cases when the controller is able to
33 demonstrate that information necessary to identify the consumer is kept separately and is
34 subject to effective technical and organizational controls that prevent the controller from
35 accessing the information.
36 5. Contractual oversight. A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or de-
37 identified data shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with contractual
38 commitments to which the pseudonymous data or de-identified data is subject and shall
39 take appropriate steps to address breaches of those contractual commitments.

3 A. Comply with federal laws or regulations or the laws or rules of a state;
4 B. Comply with a civil, criminal or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena or
5 summons by federal or state governmental authorities or governmental authorities of a
6 federally recognized Indian tribe in this State;

14 G. Take steps at the request of a consumer prior to entering into a contract;

16 safety of the consumer or another individual and when the processing cannot be
17 manifestly based on another legal basis;
18 I. Prevent, detect, protect against or respond to security incidents, identity theft, fraud,
19 harassment, malicious or deceptive activities or illegal activity or preserve the integrity
20 or security of systems or investigate, report or prosecute those responsible for an action

23 interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws and is approved,
24 monitored and governed by an institutional review board that determines, or similar
25 independent oversight entities that determine:
26 (1) Whether the deletion of the information is likely to provide substantial benefits
27 that do not exclusively accrue to the controller;
28 (2) Whether the expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks; and
29 (3) Whether the controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate
30 privacy risks associated with research, including risks associated with
31 re-identification;
32 K. Assist another controller, processor or 3rd party with obligations under this chapter;
33 or

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
1 2. Internal use. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this
2 chapter do not restrict a controller's or processor's ability to collect, use or retain data for
3 internal use to:
4 A. Conduct internal research to develop, improve or repair products, services or
5 technology;
6 B. Effectuate a product recall;
7 C. Identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality;
8 or
9 D. Perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the
10 consumer or reasonably anticipated based on the consumer's existing relationship with
11 the controller, or are otherwise compatible with processing data in furtherance of the
12 provision of a product or service specifically requested by a consumer or the
13 performance of a contract to which the consumer is a party.
14 3. Evidentiary privilege. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under
15 this chapter do not apply when compliance with this chapter by the controller or processor
16 would violate an evidentiary privilege under the laws of this State. This chapter may not
17 be construed to prevent a controller or processor from providing personal data concerning
18 a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of this State as
19 part of a privileged communication.
20 4. Liability. A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a 3rd-party
21 processor or 3rd-party controller in accordance with this chapter has not violated this
22 chapter if the 3rd-party processor or 3rd-party controller that receives and processes the
23 personal data violates this chapter, as long as, at the time the disclosing controller or
24 processor disclosed the personal data, the disclosing controller or processor did not have
25 actual knowledge that the receiving 3rd-party processor or 3rd-party controller would
26 violate this chapter. A 3rd-party controller or 3rd-party processor receiving personal data
27 from a controller or processor in compliance with this chapter is likewise not in violation
28 of this chapter for the transgressions of the controller or processor from which the 3rd-party
29 controller or 3rd-party processor receives the personal data.
30 5. Exemptions. This chapter may not be construed to:
31 A. Impose an obligation on a controller or processor that adversely affects the rights
32 or freedoms of a person, including, but not limited to, the rights of a person:
33 (1) To freedom of speech or freedom of the press guaranteed in the United States
34 Constitution, Amendment I; or
35 (2) Under Title 16, section 61; or
36 B. Apply to a person's processing of personal data in the course of the person's purely
37 personal or household activities.
38 6. Limitations. Personal data processed by a controller or processor pursuant to this
39 section may be processed only to the extent that the processing is:
40 A. Reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section; and
41 B. Adequate, relevant and limited to what is reasonably necessary in relation to the
42 specific purposes listed in this section. Personal data collected, used or retained
Page 17 - 132LR2064(03)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
413 pursuant to subsection 2 must, when applicable, take into account the nature and
424 purpose of the collection, use or retention. The data must be subject to reasonable
435 administrative, technical and physical measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity
446 and accessibility of the personal data and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of
457 harm to consumers relating to the collection, use or retention of personal data.
6 7. Controller burden. If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an
7 exemption in this section, the controller bears the burden of demonstrating that the
8 processing qualifies for the exemption and complies with the limitations in subsection 6.
9 8. Clarification of roles. Processing personal data for the purposes expressly
10 identified in this section does not solely make a legal entity a controller with respect to the
11 processing.
12 §9611. Enforcement
13 1. Violation as unfair trade practice; exclusive Attorney General enforcement. A
14 violation of this chapter constitutes an unfair trade practice under the Maine Unfair Trade
15 Practices Act, except that the rulemaking provisions of Title 5, section 207, subsection 2
16 do not apply to this chapter and except as provided in subsections 2 and 3. The Attorney
17 General has the exclusive authority to enforce violations of this chapter under the Maine
18 Unfair Trade Practices Act.
19 2. Notice. Notwithstanding any provision of Title 5, section 209 to the contrary, at
20 least 30 days prior to commencement of any action under the Maine Unfair Trade Practices
21 Act to enforce this chapter, the Attorney General shall notify the person against whom an
22 action may be brought of the intended action and give the person an opportunity to cure the
23 alleged violation or violations. The Attorney General may bring an action pursuant to this
24 section only if the controller fails to cure one or more of the alleged violations described in
25 the notice within 30 days of receiving the notice.
26 3. No private right of action. Notwithstanding Title 5, section 213, this chapter may
27 not be construed as creating a private right of action under this chapter or any other
28 provision of law against any person based on a violation of any provision of this chapter or
29 any other law.
30 4. Preemption. This chapter supersedes and preempts any ordinance, resolution, rule
31 or other regulation adopted by a political subdivision of the State regarding the processing
32 of personal data by a controller or processor.
33 §9612. Maine Privacy Fund established
34 1. Establishment; purpose. The Maine Privacy Fund, referred to in this section as
35 the "fund," is established within the Department of the Attorney General as a nonlapsing
36 fund to providing funding for the staff and activities of the department necessary to enforce
37 the provisions of this chapter.
38 2. Administration. The Department of the Attorney General shall administer the
39 fund. The fund must be established and held separate and apart from any other funds or
40 money of the State or the department and must be used and administered exclusively for

13 SUMMARY
1144 This amendment, which is a minority report of the committee, replaces the bill.
15 The amendment enacts the Maine Consumer Data Privacy Act, which takes effect July
16 1, 2026. The Act regulates the collection, use, processing, disclosure, sale and deletion of
17 nonpublicly available personal data that is linked or reasonably linkable to an individual
18 who is a resident of the State, referred to in the Act as a "consumer," or that is linked or
19 reasonably linkable to an identifiable consumer's device, by a person that conducts business
20 in this State or that produces products or services targeted to residents of this State, referred
21 to in the Act as a "controller." Under the Act, a controller must limit the collection of
22 personal data to what is adequate, relevant and reasonably necessary in relation to the
23 purposes for which the controller processes that data, as disclosed in a privacy notice
24 specifying the categories of personal data processed by the controller, the purposes for
25 processing the personal data, the categories of personal data transferred to 3rd parties and
26 the categories of 3rd parties to whom personal data is shared. The controller must also
27 process the minimum amount of personal data reasonably necessary, adequate or relevant
28 for each disclosed processing purpose.
29 A consumer has the right, under the Act, to confirm whether a controller is processing
30 the consumer's personal data; to require the controller to correct inaccuracies in or delete
31 the consumer's personal data; to obtain a copy of the consumer's personal data; and to opt
32 out of the processing of the consumer's personal data for purposes of targeted advertising,
33 sale or profiling in furtherance of decisions about the consumer's access to financial or
34 lending services, housing, insurance, education, criminal justice, employment
35 opportunities, health care services and essential goods and services. The privacy notice
36 must describe how a consumer may exercise these rights. The controller must obtain the
37 affirmative, informed consent of a consumer before processing the consumer's sensitive
38 data, including data revealing the consumer's race or ethnic origins, religious beliefs,
39 medical history or mental or physical health conditions or diagnoses, sexual orientation or
40 citizenship or immigration status; genetic or biometric data; precise geolocation data; data
41 of a known child who has not attained 13 years of age; social security, driver's license or
42 nondriver identification card number; information that permits access to a consumer's
43 financial account; or data concerning the consumer's status as the victim of a crime. If the
44 controller knows that the consumer has not attained 13 years of age, the controller may not
Page 20 - 132LR2064(03)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
415 process the consumer's data for any purpose without parental consent. If the controller
426 knows or willfully disregards that the consumer is at least 13 years of age but has not
437 attained 16 years of age, the controller may not process the consumer's data for targeted
448 advertising and must obtain the consumer's consent before processing the consumer's data
459 for sale.
6 The Act prohibits a controller from processing data in a manner that discriminates
7 against a person in violation of state or federal law. A controller is also prohibited from
8 retaliating against a consumer for exercising the consumer's rights under the Act, except
9 that a controller may offer different prices or selection of goods in connection with a
10 consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty or discount program. A controller
11 must establish, implement and maintain reasonable data security practices. Beginning July
12 1, 2026, if a controller engages in a data processing activity that presents a heightened risk
13 of harm to a consumer, including processing any data for targeted advertising, sale or
14 profiling or any processing of sensitive data, the controller must conduct and document a
15 data protection assessment to identify and weigh the benefits and potential risks of the
16 processing activity. The controller may be required to disclose the data protection
17 assessment to the Attorney General, who must keep it confidential, when the assessment is
18 relevant to an investigation conducted by the Attorney General.
19 The provisions of the Act do not apply to specifically enumerated persons, including
20 the State, political subdivisions of the State and federally recognized Indian tribes in the
21 State; financial institutions or their affiliates subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley
22 Act; state-licensed and authorized insurers; covered entities and business associates subject
23 to the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996; motor vehicle
24 dealer franchisees; nonprofits that do not receive any revenue from the sale of personal data
25 or that detect and prevent fraudulent insurance acts; and persons that both processed the
26 personal data of fewer than 25,000 consumers in the preceding calendar year and derived
27 no more than 25% of gross revenue from the sale of personal data. The Act also does not
28 apply to persons that controlled or processed the personal data for purposes other than
29 completing payment transactions of fewer than 100,000 consumers in the preceding
30 calendar year, except that, beginning January 1, 2028, this exception applies only to persons
31 that controlled or processed the personal data for purposes other than completing payment
32 transactions of fewer than 50,000 consumers in the preceding calendar year.
33 In addition, the provisions of the Act do not apply to specifically enumerated types of
34 data, including: nonpublic personal information regulated under the federal Gramm-Leach-
35 Bliley Act; health care information protected under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22,
36 section 1711-C; protected health information under the federal Health Insurance Portability
37 and Accountability Act of 1996; personal data regulated by the Family Educational Rights
38 and Privacy Act of 1974; data processed and maintained by the controller regarding an
39 applicant for employment or employee to the extent the data is collected and used within
40 the context of that role; and data necessary for the controller to administer benefits. The
41 Maine Consumer Data Privacy Act also does not prohibit controllers from engaging in
42 specifically enumerated activities, including complying with state or federal law;
43 complying with investigations or subpoenas from governmental authorities including the
44 Federal Government and the government of a state or a federally recognized Indian tribe
45 in the State; cooperating with federal, state or tribal law enforcement agencies; providing
46 a product or service specifically requested by the consumer; protecting life and physical

417 safety of consumers and preventing or responding to security incidents; and conducting
428 internal product research, effectuating a product recall or performing other internal
439 operations aligned with the expectations of a consumer.
4 Violations of the Act may be enforced exclusively by the Attorney General under the
5 Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act. The Attorney General is required to provide a potential
6 defendant with at least 30 days' notice prior to initiating an enforcement action, during
7 which time the potential defendant may cure any violation alleged in the notice. Any civil
8 penalties, attorney's fees or costs awarded to the State for a violation of the Act must be
9 deposited in the Maine Privacy Fund, which is established to provide funding for the
10 enforcement staff and activities of the Department of the Attorney General. The Act further
11 requires the Attorney General to submit a report by February 1, 2027 to the joint standing
12 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary matters regarding the
13 operation and implementation of the Act. The committee may report out legislation related
14 to the report to the 133rd Legislature in 2027.
15 The amendment also repeals the current law governing the privacy of broadband
16 Internet access service customer personal information because broadband Internet access
17 service providers are subject to the provisions of the Act.
