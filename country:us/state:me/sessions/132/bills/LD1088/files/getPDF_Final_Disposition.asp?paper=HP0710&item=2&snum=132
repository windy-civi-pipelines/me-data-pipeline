18 (2) Instructions for how to appeal the decision.
19 C. A controller shall provide information to a consumer in response to a request, free
20 of charge, once during any 12-month period, except that, if requests from a consumer
21 or other person authorized to exercise the consumer's rights are manifestly unfounded,
22 excessive, technically infeasible or repetitive, the controller may:
23 (1) Charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of
24 complying with the request; or
25 (2) Decline to act on the request.
26 The controller bears the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded, excessive,
27 technically infeasible or repetitive nature of the request.
28 D. If a controller is unable to authenticate a request to exercise a consumer right under
29 subsection 1 using commercially reasonable efforts, the controller:
30 (1) Is not required to comply with a request to initiate an action in accordance with
31 this section; and
32 (2) Shall provide notice to the consumer that the controller is unable to authenticate

35 necessary to authenticate the consumer and the consumer's request to exercise the
36 right.
37 E. Notwithstanding paragraph D and except as provided in section 9607, a controller
38 is not required to authenticate an opt-out request.
39 F. A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other

8 after the consumer's receipt of the decision.
9 A. The appeal process must be conspicuously available and similar to the process for
10 submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to this section.
11 B. Not later than the 60th day after receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the
12 consumer or other person authorized to exercise the consumer's rights in writing of

24 2. Method of designating agent. The consumer may designate an authorized agent
25 by way of, among other methods, a technology, including, but not limited to, an Internet
26 link or a browser setting, browser extension or global device setting, indicating the
27 consumer's intent to exercise the consumer's right under section 9606, subsection 1,
28 paragraph G to opt out of the collection and processing of personal data.
29 3. Authentication of agent's opt-out request. A controller shall comply with a
30 request received from an authorized agent to exercise the consumer's right under section
31 9606, subsection 1, paragraph G to opt out of the collection and processing of personal data
32 if, using commercially reasonable efforts, the controller is able to authenticate:
33 A. The identity of the consumer; and
34 B. The authorized agent's authority to act on the consumer's behalf.
35 §9608. Actions of controllers

40 B. Sell sensitive data;
Page 12 - 132LR2064(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
1 C. Collect or process personal data in violation of state or federal laws that prohibit
2 unlawful discrimination;
3 D. If the controller knows or reasonably should know that the consumer is a minor:
4 (1) Collect or process personal data of the consumer for the purpose of targeted

9 services or providing a different level of quality of goods or services to the consumer;
10 F. Collect, process or disclose personal data or publicly available information in a
11 manner that unlawfully discriminates in or otherwise unlawfully makes unavailable the
12 equal enjoyment of goods or services on the basis of an individual's actual or perceived
13 race, color, sex, sexual orientation or gender identity, physical or mental disability,
14 religion, ancestry, national origin, age or familial status. This paragraph does not apply
15 to the collection, processing or disclosure of personal data for:
16 (1) The purpose of self-testing to prevent or mitigate unlawful discrimination;
17 (2) The purpose of diversifying an applicant, participant or customer pool; or
18 (3) A private establishment described in 42 United States Code, Section 2000a(e);
19 or
20 G. Unless the controller obtains the consumer's consent, process personal data for a
21 purpose that is neither reasonably necessary to nor compatible with the disclosed
22 purposes for which the personal data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer.
23 2. Duties. A controller shall:
24 A. Limit the collection of personal data to what is reasonably necessary and
25 proportionate to provide or maintain a specific product or service requested by the
26 consumer to whom the data pertains, including any routine administrative, operational,
27 website or account-servicing activity that is consistent with the reasonable expectations
28 of the consumer under the circumstances. This paragraph does not prevent a controller
29 from processing personal data collected in accordance with this paragraph to provide
30 advertising to a consumer based on the consumer's activities within the controller's own
31 websites or online applications;
32 B. Establish, implement and maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical
33 data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of
34 personal data appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data at issue. These
35 processes must include the disposal of personal data in accordance with a retention
36 schedule that requires the disposal of personal data by the controller when the data is
37 required to be deleted by law or when the data is no longer necessary for the purpose
38 for which the data was processed unless the consumer has consented to the retention
39 of the data for a longer period of time or retention of the data is required by law. For
40 purposes of this paragraph, "disposal of personal data" means the destruction or
41 permanent deletion of the data or other modification of the data to make the data
42 unreadable and unrecoverable; and
Page 13 - 132LR2064(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
1 C. Provide an effective mechanism for a consumer to revoke the consumer's consent to
2 processing personal data under this section that is at least as easy to use as the
3 mechanism by which the consumer provided the consumer's consent and, upon
4 revocation of the consent, shall cease to process the data as soon as practicable, but not
5 later than 30 days after the receipt of the request.
6 3. Exceptions; loyalty programs. Subsection 1 and 2 may not be construed to:

8 personal data of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain; or
9 B. Prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality or selection
10 of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if
11 the offering is in connection with a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide
12 loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts or club card program, as long as the sale
13 of personal data is not a condition of participation in the program.
14 4. Privacy notice. A controller shall provide consumers with a reasonably accessible,
15 clear and meaningful privacy notice that includes the following information:
16 A. The categories of personal data, including sensitive data, collected or processed by
17 the controller;
18 B. The controller's purpose for collecting and processing personal data;
19 C. How consumers may exercise their consumer rights under this chapter, including
20 how a consumer may appeal a controller's decision regarding the consumer's request
21 and how a consumer may revoke consent;
22 D. The categories of 3rd parties with which the controller shares personal data, with a
23 level of detail that enables a consumer to understand the type of, business model of or
24 processing conducted by each category of 3rd party;
25 E. The categories of personal data, including sensitive data, the controller shares with
26 any 3rd party;
27 F. The length of time the controller intends to retain each category of personal data or,
28 if it is not possible to identify the length of time, the criteria used to determine the
29 length of time the controller intends to retain each category of personal data; and
30 G. An active e-mail address or other online mechanism that a consumer may use to
31 contact the controller.
32 5. Notice of sale of personal data, targeted advertising or profiling; opt-out
33 mechanism. If a controller sells personal data to 3rd parties, collects or processes personal
34 data for the purposes of targeted advertising or processes personal data for the purposes of
35 profiling the consumer in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant
36 effects concerning the consumer, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose the
37 sale, collection or processing, as well as the manner in which a consumer may exercise the
38 right to opt out of the sale, collection or processing. The disclosure required under this
39 subsection must be prominently displayed on the controller's publicly accessible website
40 and the language used must be clear, easy to understand and unambiguous.
41 6. Method for exercising consumer rights. A controller shall establish, and shall
42 describe in the privacy notice as required by subsection 4, paragraph C, one or more secure
Page 14 - 132LR2064(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
413 and reliable mechanisms for a consumer to submit a request to exercise each consumer
424 right under this chapter.
3 A. The design of the secure and reliable mechanism for a consumer to submit a request
4 must take into account:
5 (1) The ways in which consumers normally interact with the controller;
6 (2) The need for secure and reliable communication of consumer requests; and
7 (3) The ability of the controller to verify the identity of a consumer making the
8 request.
9 B. A controller may not require a consumer to create a new account to exercise a
10 consumer right. A controller may require a consumer to use an existing account to
11 exercise a consumer right.
12 C. A controller may satisfy the controller's obligation under this subsection to establish
13 a secure and reliable mechanism for a consumer to exercise the right to opt out under
14 subsection 5 by:
15 (1) Providing a clear and conspicuous link on the controller's publicly accessible
16 website to a webpage that allows a consumer, an authorized agent of the consumer
17 or a person authorized by section 9606, subsection 4 to exercise the consumer's
18 rights to opt out of any collection or processing of the consumer's personal data for
19 the purposes of targeted advertising or profiling or any sale of personal data; and
20 (2) No later than September 1, 2026, allowing a consumer to opt out of any
21 collection or processing of the consumer's personal data for the purposes of
22 targeted advertising or any sale of personal data through an opt-out preference
23 signal sent, with the consumer's consent, by a platform, technology or mechanism
24 to the controller indicating the consumer's intent to opt out of the collection,
25 processing or sale as described in section 9607, subsection 2. The platform,
26 technology or mechanism:
27 (a) Must be consumer-friendly and easy to use by the average consumer;
28 (b) Must use clear, easy to understand and unambiguous language;
29 (c) Must be as consistent as possible with any other similar platform,
30 technology or mechanism required by federal or state law, rule or regulation;
31 (d) Must enable the controller to reasonably determine whether the consumer
32 is a resident of the State, which reasonable determination may be based on the
33 location associated with the consumer's Internet protocol address, and whether
34 the consumer has made a legitimate request to opt out of any such collection,
35 processing or sale of the consumer's personal data;
36 (e) May not unfairly disadvantage another controller; and
37 (f) May not make use of a default setting but must require the consumer to
38 make an affirmative, freely given and unambiguous choice to opt out of any
39 such collection, processing or sale of the consumer's personal data.
40 A controller that recognizes an opt-out preference signal that has been approved by the
41 laws of another state is considered to be in compliance with this paragraph.
Page 15 - 132LR2064(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
1 D. If a consumer's decision to opt out of any collection or processing of the consumer's
2 personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising or profiling or any sale of
3 personal data through an opt-out preference signal sent in accordance with paragraph
4 C, subparagraph (2) conflicts with the consumer's existing controller-specific privacy
5 setting or the consumer's voluntary participation in a controller's bona fide loyalty,
6 rewards, premium features, discounts or club card program, the controller may notify
7 the consumer of the conflict and provide the consumer a choice to confirm the
8 controller-specific privacy setting or participation that program.
9 §9609. Responsibilities of processors and controllers
10 1. Contract required. If a controller uses a processor to process personal data of a
11 consumer, the controller and the processor shall enter into a contract in accordance with
12 the requirements of this section that governs the processor's data processing procedures
13 with respect to processing performed on behalf of the controller.
14 A. The contract must be binding and must clearly set forth:
15 (1) Instructions for processing personal data;
16 (2) The nature and purpose of the processing;
17 (3) The type of personal data subject to processing;
18 (4) The duration of the processing; and
19 (5) The rights and obligations of the processor and the controller.
20 B. The contract must require that the processor:
21 (1) Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of
22 confidentiality with respect to the data;
23 (2) Establish, implement and maintain reasonable administrative, technical and
24 physical data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity and
25 accessibility of personal data, considering the volume and nature of the personal
26 data;
27 (3) Stop processing personal data on request by the controller made in accordance
28 with a consumer's authenticated request;
29 (4) At the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller
30 as requested at the end of the provision of service, unless retention of the personal
31 data is required by law;
32 (5) On the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all
33 information in the processor's possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's
34 compliance with the obligations in this chapter;
35 (6) Engage any subcontractor to assist with processing personal data on the
36 controller's behalf only in accordance with a written contract that requires the
37 subcontractor to meet the processor's obligations regarding the personal data under
38 the processor's contract with the controller;
39 (7) Allow and cooperate with reasonable assessments by the controller, the
40 controller's designated assessor or a qualified and independent assessor arranged
41 for by the processor to assess the processor's policies and technical and
Page 16 - 132LR2064(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
412 organizational measures in support of the obligations under this chapter. An
423 assessment conducted under this subparagraph must be conducted using an
434 appropriate and accepted control standard framework and assessment procedure;
445 and
5 (8) On request of the controller, provide the controller with a report of an
6 assessment conducted under subparagraph (7).
7 2. Processor responsibilities. A processor shall:
8 A. Adhere to a contract with a controller and the instructions of the controller;
9 B. Assist the controller in meeting the controller's obligations under this chapter,
10 including:
11 (1) By employing appropriate technical and organizational measures as much as
12 reasonably practicable to fulfill the controller's obligation to respond to requests to
13 exercise consumer rights, considering the nature of processing and the information
14 available to the processor; and
15 (2) By assisting the controller in meeting the controller's obligations in relation to
16 the security of processing the personal data under this chapter and in relation to the
17 notification of a breach of the security of a system, as required by chapter 210-B;
18 and
19 C. Provide necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document
20 data protection assessments as required by section 9610.
21 3. Processing relationship liability. This section may not be construed to relieve a
22 controller or a processor from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by virtue
23 of the controller's or processor's role in the processing relationship in accordance with this
24 section.
25 4. Fact-based determination of role. The determination of whether a person is acting
26 as a controller or a processor with respect to a specific processing of personal data is a fact-
27 based determination that depends on the context in which the personal data is being
28 processed as described in this subsection.
29 A. A person is considered to be a controller if:
30 (1) The person is not limited in the person's processing of specific personal data in
31 accordance with a controller's instructions; or
32 (2) The person fails to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific
33 processing of personal data.
34 B. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a
35 specific processing of personal data remains a processor.
36 C. If a processor or 3rd party begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the
37 purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor is a controller
38 with respect to the processing and may be subject to an enforcement action under
39 section 9613.
40 5. Controller's duties unaffected. This section may not be construed to alter a
41 controller's obligation to limit a person's processing of personal data or to take steps to
42 ensure that a processor adheres to the controller's instructions.

1 §9610. Data protection assessments
2 1. Definition. For the purposes of this section, "processing activities that present a
3 heightened risk of harm to a consumer" means:
4 A. The collection or processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted
5 advertising;
6 B. The sale of personal data;
7 C. The collection or processing of sensitive data; and
8 D. The processing of personal data for the purposes of profiling, in which the profiling
9 presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:
10 (1) Unfair, abusive or deceptive treatment of a consumer;
11 (2) Having an unlawful disparate impact on a consumer;
12 (3) Financial, physical or reputational injury to a consumer;
13 (4) A physical or other intrusion on the solitude or seclusion, or the private affairs
14 or concerns, of a consumer, when the intrusion would be offensive to a reasonable
15 person; or
16 (5) Other substantial injury to a consumer.
17 2. Data protection assessments required. A controller shall conduct and document
18 a data protection assessment for each of the controller's collection or processing activities
19 that present a heightened risk of harm to a consumer. A single data protection assessment
20 may address a comparable set of collection or processing operations that include similar
21 activities.
22 3. Required elements. A data protection assessment required by subsection 2 must
23 be conducted in accordance with the requirements of this subsection.
24 A. The data protection assessment must identify and weigh the benefits that may flow
25 directly and indirectly from the collection or processing to the controller, the consumer,
26 other interested parties and the public against:
27 (1) The potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with the collection
28 or processing as mitigated by safeguards that may be employed by the controller
29 to reduce these risks; and
30 (2) The necessity and proportionality of collection or processing in relation to the
31 stated purpose of the collection or processing.
32 B. The controller shall factor into a data protection assessment:
33 (1) The use of de-identified data;
34 (2) The reasonable expectations of consumers;
35 (3) The context of the collection or processing; and
36 (4) The relationship between the controller and the consumer whose personal data
37 will be collected or processed.
38 4. Disclosure to Attorney General. The Attorney General may require that a
39 controller disclose to the Attorney General a data protection assessment that is relevant to
Page 18 - 132LR2064(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
410 an investigation conducted by the Attorney General. The Attorney General may evaluate
421 the data protection assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in this
432 chapter.
4 5. Confidentiality. A data protection assessment is confidential and exempt from
5 disclosure under Title 1, chapter 13 but may be used by the Attorney General in an action
6 to enforce this chapter. To the extent that any information contained in a data protection
7 assessment disclosed to the Attorney General pursuant to this section includes information
8 subject to attorney-client privilege or work product protection, the disclosure does not
9 constitute a waiver of that privilege or protection.
10 6. Reciprocity. If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose
11 of complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection assessment
12 satisfies the requirements established in this section if the data protection assessment is
13 reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data protection assessment that would
14 otherwise be conducted in accordance with this section.
15 7. Deadlines for performing data protection assessments. A controller shall
16 conduct and document a data protection assessment as required by this section:
17 A. Within 6 months of the date that the controller first engages in a collection or
18 processing activity that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer; and
19 B. Within 6 months of making a material change to any collection or processing
20 activity that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer.
21 8. Application. The requirement to conduct a data protection assessment under this
22 section applies only to collection or processing activities that occur on or after September
23 1, 2026.
24 §9611. De-identified data
25 1. Re-identification not required. This chapter may not be construed to require a
26 controller or processor to:
27 A. Re-identify de-identified data;
28 B. Maintain data in an identifiable form; or
29 C. Collect, obtain, retain or access any data or technology in order to be capable of
30 associating an authenticated consumer request with personal data.
31 2. Consumer requests. This chapter may not be construed to require a controller or
32 processor to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request if the controller:
33 A. Is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal data, or it
34 would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request with the
35 personal data;
36 B. Does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the consumer who is the
37 subject of the personal data, or associate the personal data with other personal data
38 about the same consumer; and
39 C. Does not sell the personal data to a 3rd party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the
40 personal data to a 3rd party other than a processor, except as otherwise allowed in this
41 chapter.
Page 19 - 132LR2064(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
1 3. Contractual oversight. A controller that discloses de-identified data shall exercise
2 reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with contractual commitments to which the
3 de-identified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to address breaches of those
4 contractual commitments. Whether oversight is reasonable and whether steps taken to
5 address breaches of contractual commitments are appropriate depends in part on whether
6 the disclosed de-identified data would be considered sensitive data if the data were re-
7 identified.
8 §9612. Exemptions
9 1. Exempt activities. This chapter may not be construed to restrict a controller's or
10 processor's ability to:
11 A. Comply with federal laws or regulations, the laws and rules of the State or local
12 laws and ordinances;
13 B. Comply with a civil, criminal or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena or
14 summons by a federal or Maine governmental authority, including a governmental
15 authority of a federally recognized Indian tribe in the State;
16 C. Cooperate with federal, tribal or Maine law enforcement agencies concerning
17 conduct or activity that the controller or processor reasonably and in good faith believes
18 may violate federal laws or regulations, the laws and rules of the State or local laws
19 and ordinances;
20 D. Investigate, establish, exercise, prepare for or defend legal claims;
21 E. Provide a product or service specifically requested by a consumer;
22 F. Perform under a contract to which a consumer is a party, including fulfilling the
23 terms of a written warranty;
24 G. Take steps at the request of a consumer prior to entering into a contract;
25 H. Take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life or physical
26 safety of the consumer or another individual and when the processing cannot be
27 manifestly based on another legal basis;
28 I. Prevent, detect, protect against, investigate, prosecute those responsible for or
29 respond to security incidents, identity theft, fraud, harassment, malicious or deceptive
30 activities or any other type of illegal activity;
31 J. Preserve the integrity or security of systems;
32 K. Assist another controller or processor or a 3rd party with an obligation under this
33 chapter; or
34 L. Transfer assets to a 3rd party in the context of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or
35 similar transaction when the 3rd party assumes control, in whole or in part, of the
36 controller's assets, but only if the controller, in a reasonable time prior to the transfer,
37 provides an affected consumer with:
38 (1) A notice describing the transfer, including the name of the entity receiving the
39 consumer's personal data and the applicable privacy policies of the receiving entity;
40 and
41 (2) A reasonable opportunity to:
Page 20 - 132LR2064(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
1 (a) Withdraw any previous consent related to the consumer's personal data; and
2 (b) Request deletion of the consumer's personal data.
3 2. Internal use. The obligations imposed on a controller or processor under this
4 chapter do not restrict a controller's or processor's ability to collect, use or retain personal
5 data for internal use to:
6 A. Effectuate a product recall;
7 B. Identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality; or
8 C. Perform internal operations that:
9 (1) Are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer or can be
10 reasonably anticipated based on the consumer's existing relationship with the
11 controller; or
12 (2) Are otherwise compatible with processing data to provide a product or service
13 specifically requested by a consumer or performing under a contract to which the
14 consumer is a party.
15 3. Evidentiary privilege. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under
16 this chapter do not apply when compliance with this chapter by the controller or processor
17 would violate an evidentiary privilege under state law. This chapter may not be construed
18 to prevent a controller or processor from providing personal data concerning a consumer
19 to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under state law as part of a privileged
20 communication.
21 4. Exceptions to liability. This subsection limits the liability of a controller, processor
22 or 3rd-party controller for violations of this chapter by other persons.
23 A. A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a processor or a 3rd-party
24 controller in compliance with this chapter has not violated this chapter if the processor
25 or 3rd-party controller that receives the personal data violates this chapter as long as:

27 the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual knowledge that the
28 receiving processor or 3rd-party controller would violate this chapter; and
29 (2) At the time the disclosing controller or processor disclosed the personal data,
30 the disclosing controller or processor was, and remained, in compliance with its
31 obligations as the discloser of the personal data.
32 B. A 3rd-party controller or processor that receives personal data from a controller or
33 processor in compliance with this chapter is not in violation of this chapter for the

35 controller or processor received the personal data.
36 5. Freedom of speech; freedom of the press; personal or household use. This
37 chapter may not be construed to:

11 confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of the personal data and reduce reasonably
12 foreseeable risks of harm to consumers relating to the collection, use or retention of
13 personal data;
14 B. Reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section; and
15 C. Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the specific

20 §9613. Enforcement
21 1. Violation as unfair trade practice; exclusive Attorney General enforcement. A
22 violation of this chapter constitutes an unfair trade practice under the Maine Unfair Trade
23 Practices Act, except that the provisions of Title 5, section 213 do not apply to this chapter
24 and except as provided in subsection 2. The Attorney General has the exclusive authority
25 to enforce violations of this chapter under the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act.
26 2. Discretionary notice and right to cure. Notwithstanding any provision of the
27 Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act to the contrary, before initiating any action under
28 subsection 1 for an alleged violation that occurs on or before April 1, 2027, if the Attorney
29 General believes that it is possible to cure the alleged violation, the Attorney General may
30 issue a notice of violation to the controller or processor that is allegedly violating this
31 chapter. If the Attorney General issues a notice of violation to a controller or processor
32 under this subsection, the Attorney General may not bring an action to enforce the violation
33 unless the controller or processor fails to cure the violation within 60 days of receiving the
34 notice of violation. The Attorney General shall consider the following factors in deciding
35 whether to issue a notice of violation under this subsection:
36 A. The number of alleged violations;
37 B. The size and complexity of the controller or processor;
38 C. The nature and extent of the controller's or processor's collection or processing
39 activities;
40 D. The likelihood of injury to the public;
41 E. The degree to which the alleged violations affect the safety of persons and property;
42 F. Whether the alleged violation was likely caused by a human or technical error; and

Page 23 - 132LR2064(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
411 sale and deletion of nonpublicly available personal data by a person that conducts business
422 in this State or that produces products or services targeted to residents of this State, referred
433 to in the Act as a "controller," if the personal data is linked or can be reasonably linked to
444 an identified or identifiable individual who is a resident of this State, referred to in the Act
455 as a "consumer," or is linked or reasonably can be linked to a device that is linked or
466 reasonably can be linked to an identified or identifiable consumer. Under the Act, a
477 controller must limit the collection and processing of personal data to what is reasonably
488 necessary and proportionate to provide or maintain a specific product or service requested
499 by the consumer, including the collection of personal data to provide advertising to the
1500 consumer based on the consumer's activities within the controller's own websites or online
1511 applications. The controller must also limit the collection and processing of certain
1522 sensitive data to what is strictly necessary to provide or maintain a specific product or
1533 service requested by the consumer. Under the Act, "sensitive data" includes data revealing
1544 a consumer's race or ethnic origins, religious beliefs, mental or physical health conditions
1555 or diagnoses, sexual orientation, gender identity, citizenship or immigration status; genetic
1566 or biometric data; precise geolocation data; social security, driver's license or nondriver
1577 identification card numbers; specific financial information; data of a minor under 18 years
1588 of age; or data concerning the consumer's status as the victim of a crime.
19 The Act establishes that consumers have the right to confirm whether a controller is
20 processing their data; correct inaccuracies in their personal data; require the controller to
21 delete any portion of their personal data that the controller is not required to maintain by
22 law; obtain a copy of their personal data in a format that can be readily transferred to
23 another controller; obtain a list of the 3rd parties to which the controller has sold personal
24 data; and opt out of the processing of their personal data for purposes of targeted
25 advertising, sale or consumer profiling. The Act also prohibits a controller from selling
26 any sensitive data; processing the personal data of a minor for purposes of targeted
27 advertising or sale; processing personal data in a manner that discriminates against a person
28 in violation of state or federal law; and retaliating against a consumer for exercising a
29 consumer's rights under the Act, except that a controller may offer different prices or
30 selection of goods in connection with a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide
31 loyalty or discount program.
32 The Act also requires a controller to provide consumers with a privacy notice
33 specifying how a consumer may exercise the consumer's rights under the Act; the
34 categories of personal data processed by the controller; the purposes for processing the
35 personal data; the categories of personal data transferred to 3rd parties; and the categories
36 of 3rd parties to whom personal data is shared. The controller must establish, implement
37 and maintain reasonable data security practices and a retention schedule that requires the
38 disposal of personal data by the controller either when deletion is required by law or when
39 the data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was processed and retention of
40 the data is not required by law. The controller must also require, by contract, that any
41 person who processes a consumer's personal data on behalf of the controller treats the
42 personal data confidentially and deletes or returns all personal data to the controller at the
43 end of the processing, unless retention of the data is required by law. If a controller engages
44 in a data processing activity that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer,
45 including processing any data for targeted advertising, sale or profiling or any processing
46 of sensitive data, the controller must conduct and document a data protection assessment
47 identifying and weighing the benefits and potential risks of the processing activity. The
Page 24 - 132LR2064(02)

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 710, L.D. 1088
418 controller may be required to disclose the data protection assessment to the Attorney
429 General, who must keep it confidential, when the assessment is relevant to an investigation
530 conducted by the Attorney General.
4 The Act further prohibits any person from establishing a geofence within 1,750 feet of
5 any in-person health care facility in the State, other than the operator of the facility, for the
6 purpose of identifying, tracking, collecting data from or sending a notification regarding
7 consumer health data to consumers who enter that area.
8 The provisions of the Act do not apply to specifically enumerated persons, including
9 the State, political subdivisions of the State and federally recognized Indian tribes in the
10 State; nonprofit organizations; institutions of higher education; federally registered national
11 securities associations; supervised financial organizations and service corporations; health
12 care facilities and health care practitioners as well as their affiliates that both qualify as
13 business associates and provide services only to covered entities; state-licensed and
14 authorized insurers that are in compliance with applicable Maine laws governing insurer
15 data security and data privacy; and broadband Internet service providers to the extent those
16 providers are subject to the data privacy requirements of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title
17 35-A, section 9301. In addition, the provisions of the Act do not apply to specifically
18 enumerated types of data, including, for example: nonpublic personal information
19 regulated under the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; protected health information under
20 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996; personal data
21 regulated by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974; personal data
22 collected and used pursuant to the federal Controlled Substances Act; data processed and
23 maintained by the controller regarding an applicant for employment or employee to the
24 extent the data is collected and used within the context of that role; and data necessary for
25 the controller to administer benefits.
26 The Act also does not prohibit controllers from engaging in specifically enumerated
27 activities, including, for example: complying with state or federal law; complying with
28 investigations or subpoenas from federal, state or tribal governmental authorities;
29 cooperating with federal, tribal or Maine law enforcement agencies; providing a product or
30 service specifically requested by the consumer; protecting life and physical safety of
31 consumers; preventing or responding to security incidents; and transferring data as part of
32 a merger, acquisition or bankruptcy as long as the consumer is given advance notice and a
33 reasonable opportunity to request deletion of the consumer's personal data. The Act also
34 does not prohibit a controller from using personal data collected in a lawful manner to
35 effectuate a product recall, identify and repair technical errors and perform internal
36 operations that are reasonably aligned with a consumer's expectations or otherwise
37 compatible with providing the product or service specifically requested by the consumer.
38 Violations of the Act may be enforced exclusively by the Attorney General under the
39 Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act. If the violation occurs on or before April 1, 2027, the
40 Attorney General may provide a potential defendant with a notice of violation at least 60
41 days prior to initiating an enforcement action, during which time the potential defendant
42 may cure the violation to avoid the enforcement action. The amendment further requires
43 the Attorney General to submit a report by February 1, 2027, and annually thereafter, to
44 the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary matters
