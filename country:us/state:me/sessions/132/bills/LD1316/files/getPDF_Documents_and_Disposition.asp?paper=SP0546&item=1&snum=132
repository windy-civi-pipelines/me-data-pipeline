27 SUMMARY
2288 This bill clarifies that mandated reporters are not required to document suspected
2299 abuse, neglect or exploitation in the subject's medical record or report shared to 3rd parties.
3300 Reports must still be made to the Department of Health and Human Services. If suspected
3311 abuse, neglect or exploitation is documented in a medical record or other report that is
3322 shared with a 3rd party outside of the reporter's office or place of business and the reporter
3333 subsequently discovers information that may dispute or counter a report of suspected abuse,
3344 neglect or exploitation, the reporter is required to add the subsequent information to the
3355 medical record or other report and forward the amended medical record or other report to
3366 every 3rd party who received the initial medical record or other report. If a reporter
3377 discovers information that disputes or counters a report of abuse, neglect or exploitation
3388 provided to the Department of Health and Human Services, the reporter is required to
3399 forward the subsequent information to the department within 48 hours of discovery of the
4400 subsequent information. This bill excepts from immunity persons who violate the reporting
4411 laws or provide 3rd parties an unverified diagnosis or subjective opinion of abuse, neglect
4422 or exploitation.
