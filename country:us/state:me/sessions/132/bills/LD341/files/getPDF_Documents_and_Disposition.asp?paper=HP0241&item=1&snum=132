2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, this legislation amends the law regarding the registration of oversized all-
4 terrain vehicles and must take effect before the expiration of the 90-day period so that it
5 applies to registrations for the 2025 all-terrain vehicle season; and
6 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
7 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
8 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,

17 oversized ATV, the new owner may also register that oversized ATV upon payment of the
18 fee specified in subsection 5, paragraph A. Registration is not required for an oversized
19 ATV operated by a person on the land of another if written permission is received from the
