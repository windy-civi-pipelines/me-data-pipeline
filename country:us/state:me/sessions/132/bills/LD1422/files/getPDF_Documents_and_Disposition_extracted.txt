10 SUMMARY
1111 This bill provides for open primary elections for the elections for United States Senator,
1122 United States Representative to Congress, Governor, State Senator and State
1133 Representative. All of the candidates for those offices, including candidates enrolled in a
1144 party and unenrolled candidates, must appear on the same open primary ballot. All
1155 qualified voters, regardless of enrollment status, are eligible to vote in open primary
1166 elections.
17 The votes in an open primary election must be tabulated using ranked-choice voting,
18 except that, for the office of Governor, State Senator or State Representative, the 2
19 candidates who receive the most votes are declared the winners of the open primary and,
20 for the office of United States Senator or United States Representative to Congress, the 4
21 candidates who receive the most votes are declared winners of the open primary. The
22 names of the winners of an open primary must appear on the ballot for the general election.
23 The winner of the general election for the office of United States Senator or United States
24 Representative to Congress is determined by ranked-choice voting. If one of the candidates
25 who received the most votes at the open primary dies or becomes disqualified before the
26 general election, that candidate's name must remain on the ballot and the voters must be
27 notified that a vote for that candidate will be counted and, if that candidate is declared the
28 winner of the election, a vacancy will be declared at the beginning of the term of the office
29 for which the candidate was elected. Voters may not vote for a write-in candidate in a
30 general election that was preceded by an open primary election.
31 The bill removes primary elections for the office of President of the United States from
32 the list of elections determined by ranked-choice voting.

10 SUMMARY
1111 This bill provides for open primary elections for the elections for United States Senator,
1122 United States Representative to Congress, Governor, State Senator and State
1133 Representative. All of the candidates for those offices, including candidates enrolled in a
1144 party and unenrolled candidates, must appear on the same open primary ballot. All
1155 qualified voters, regardless of enrollment status, are eligible to vote in open primary
1166 elections.
17 The votes in an open primary election must be tabulated using ranked-choice voting,
18 except that, for the office of Governor, State Senator or State Representative, the 2
19 candidates who receive the most votes are declared the winners of the open primary and,
20 for the office of United States Senator or United States Representative to Congress, the 4
21 candidates who receive the most votes are declared winners of the open primary. The
22 names of the winners of an open primary must appear on the ballot for the general election.
23 The winner of the general election for the office of United States Senator or United States
24 Representative to Congress is determined by ranked-choice voting. If one of the candidates
25 who received the most votes at the open primary dies or becomes disqualified before the
26 general election, that candidate's name must remain on the ballot and the voters must be
27 notified that a vote for that candidate will be counted and, if that candidate is declared the
28 winner of the election, a vacancy will be declared at the beginning of the term of the office
29 for which the candidate was elected. Voters may not vote for a write-in candidate in a
30 general election that was preceded by an open primary election.
31 The bill removes primary elections for the office of President of the United States from
32 the list of elections determined by ranked-choice voting.
