19 SUMMARY
2200 Under current law, it is a Class D crime to negligently store a loaded firearm in a
2211 manner that allows a child under 16 years of age to gain access to the loaded firearm without
2222 the permission of the child's parent. This bill repeals that law and makes it a Class D crime
2233 to negligently store a firearm so that a minor or person who is prohibited from possessing
2244 a firearm may gain access to the firearm and either use it in the commission of a crime or
2255 display it in a threatening manner. The bill also makes it a Class C crime to negligently
2266 store a firearm in a way so that a minor or prohibited person may gain access to the firearm
2277 and use it to cause the death of or serious bodily injury to any person. The bill also requires
2288 licensed firearms dealers to post a notice in any area where sales or transfers occur
2299 informing purchasers that access to a firearm in the home significantly increases the risk of
3300 suicide, death during domestic violence disputes and unintentional death of children.
