433 Session of the 132nd Legislature.
4 SUMMARY
55 This resolve establishes the Commission to Study Pathways for Creating a Thermal
66 Energy Networks Program in Maine. The commission is composed of legislators and public
77 members, including, but not limited to, members with experience in engineering, research
88 in the fields of thermal energy network development and workforce development.
