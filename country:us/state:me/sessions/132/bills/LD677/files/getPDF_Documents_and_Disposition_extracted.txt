8 B. Any part designed and intended solely and exclusively, or combination of parts
9 designed and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a machine gun, including,

11 (1) A device that, when installed in or attached to a firearm, allows the firearm to
12 discharge 2 or more shots with a single pull of the trigger;
13 (2) A device that applies force to a firearm’s trigger bar to prevent it from limiting
14 the weapon to firing only one round each time the trigger is depressed; or
15 (3) A power-driven device that, when installed in or attached to a firearm,
16 repeatedly activates the trigger of the firearm through the use of a crank, a lever or
17 any other part that is turned in a circular motion.
18 Sec. 2. 17-A MRSA §1060 is enacted to read:
19 §1060. Possession of rapid-fire device
20 1. A person is guilty of possession of a rapid-fire device if, without authority to do so,
21 that person knowingly possesses a rapid-fire device.
22 2. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following terms

24 A. "Rapid-fire device" means a device, part or combination of parts that is not a
25 machine gun and that materially increases the rate of fire of a semi-automatic firearm
26 above the rate of fire of the semi-automatic firearm absent the device, part or
27 combination of parts, including, but not limited to:
28 (1) A device that, when installed in or attached to a firearm, increases the rate of
29 fire of the firearm by using energy from the recoil of the firearm to generate a
30 reciprocating action that facilitates repeated activation of the trigger;
31 (2) A device that, when installed in or attached to a firearm, fires both when the
32 trigger is pulled and on release of the trigger; or
33 (3) A manual device that, when installed in or attached to a firearm, repeatedly
34 activates the trigger of the firearm through the use of a crank, a lever or any other
35 part that is turned in a circular motion.
36 B. "Semi-automatic firearm" means a firearm that:
37 (1) Upon the initiation of the firing sequence, fires the first chambered cartridge
38 and uses a portion of the energy of the firing cartridge to:
39 (a) Extract the expended cartridge case;
Page 1 - 132LR0737(01)
1 (b) Chamber the next cartridge; and
2 (c) Prepare the firing mechanism to fire again;
3 (2) Requires a separate movement for each individual operation of the trigger or
4 firing mechanism; and
5 (3) Is not a machine gun.
6 3. Possession of a rapid-fire device is a Class D crime.
7 SUMMARY
88 This bill modifies the provision of the Maine Criminal Code defining "machine gun"
99 to include any part or combination of parts designed and intended for use in converting a
1100 weapon into a machine gun.
11 The bill enacts a provision that makes it a Class D crime for a person to knowingly
12 possess a rapid-fire device without authority to do so. A rapid-fire device is a device, part
13 or combination of parts that is not a machine gun and that materially increases the rate of
14 fire of a semi-automatic firearm above the rate of fire of the semi-automatic firearm absent
15 the device, part or combination of parts.
16 With respect to the definitions of "machine gun" and "rapid-fire device," the bill
17 provides a nonexhaustive list of examples describing the types of devices that would satisfy
18 each general definition.
