H.P. 430 - L.D. 662
An Act to Support Survivors of Military Sexual Trauma and Active Duty
Military Members Transitioning to Civilian Life
Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, veterans have made significant sacrifices to protect our country and ensure
our freedom, and many of those veterans in Maine may face challenges transitioning back
to civilian life; and
Whereas, the Legislature remains committed to supporting efforts that assist military
service members and their families as they separate from military service and transition
back to civilian life by helping them find stable employment, access health care and
housing and find their place in society; and
Whereas, it is particularly important to support those veterans who have sacrificed
more than others because they have experienced military sexual trauma while serving their
country in the military; and
Whereas, this legislation needs to take effect before the expiration of the 90-day
period to provide desperately needed funding to organizations that support veterans and
their families; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore,
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
Sec. 1. 5 MRSA §13056-K is enacted to read:
