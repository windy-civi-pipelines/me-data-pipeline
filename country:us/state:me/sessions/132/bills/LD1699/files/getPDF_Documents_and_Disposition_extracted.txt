23 year. For investments made on or after April 1, 2025, a tax credit certificate may be
24 issued to an investor other than a private venture capital fund in an amount not more

27 defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.
28 B. The Maine business or agricultural enterprise must be determined by the authority
29 to be a manufacturer or a value-added natural resource enterprise; must provide a

37 investment is necessary to allow the agricultural enterprise to expand its enterprise.
38 C. Aggregate investment eligible for tax credits may not be more than $5,000,000 for

449 aggregate investment eligible for tax credits may not be more than $5,000,000 for that
550 business as of the date of the issuance of the tax credit certificate, and the $2,000,000
561 annual limitation does not apply.

29 or working capital for the business or such other business activity as may be approved
30 by the authority. For an agricultural enterprise, the investment may also be expended
31 on infrastructure, which does not include real estate but includes any improvement that
32 expands the marketing, production or processing of agricultural products, as defined in
33 Title 7, section 152, subsection 2, as approved by the authority.

448 corporations, nontaxable trusts and any other entities that are treated as flow-through
459 entities for tax purposes under the Code, the individual partners, members, stockholders,
560 beneficiaries or equity owners of such entities must be treated as the investors under this
571 section and are allowed a credit against the tax otherwise due from them under this Part in
582 proportion to their respective interests in those partnerships, limited liability companies, S
593 corporations, trusts or other flow-through entities. Except as limited or authorized by
1504 subsection 3 or 4, 25% of the credit must be taken in the taxable year in which the
1515 investment is made and 25% per year must be taken in each of the next 3 taxable years.
1526 With respect to tax credit certificates issued under Title 10, section 1100‑T, subsection 2‑C,
1537 the credits are refundable and the investor shall file a return requesting a refund for an
1548 investment for which it has received a tax credit certificate in the calendar year following
1559 the calendar year during which the investment was made.
