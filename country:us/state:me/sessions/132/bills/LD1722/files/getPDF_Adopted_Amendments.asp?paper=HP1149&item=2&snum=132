20 Whereas, this legislation seeks to simplify the administrative procedures the
21 department must go through in an effort to reduce wait times for lease applicants; and
22 Whereas, it is important that this legislation take effect immediately to reduce barriers
23 to entry for applicants as soon as possible; and
24 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within

314 aquaculture to be conducted during the new lease term. If the renewal application is
325 received after the expiration of a lease but within 30 days of the date of expiration, the
336 application must include a nonrefundable $500 late fee in order for the application to
347 be accepted. The late fee may be waived by the commissioner if a substantial illness or
358 medical condition prevented the leaseholder from submitting the application prior to
369 the date of expiration. The applicant shall provide the commissioner with
470 documentation from a physician describing the substantial illness or medical condition.
481 The commissioner may not process an application received more than 30 days after the
492 expiration of a lease, and the applicant's lease expires;
10 B. The lessee has complied with the lease agreement during the term of the lease. The
11 department shall consider the compliance record of the leaseholder. For the purposes
12 of this paragraph, "compliance record" means department aquaculture inspection
13 reports and enforcement actions as they relate to the operation of an aquaculture lease;
14 C. The commissioner determines that renewal of the lease is in the best interest of the
15 State;
16 D. Except as provided in subsection 13‑A, the renewal will not cause the lessee to
17 become a tenant of any kind in leases covering an aggregate of more than 500 acres;
18 and
19 E. The lease is not being held for speculative purposes.
20 If a person who holds a lease pursuant to this section applies to renew the lease, the lease
21 remains in effect until the commissioner makes a decision on the renewal application. If
22 the renewal is denied, the lease expires 30 120 days after the date of the commissioner's
23 decision and the leaseholder is responsible for removing all gear and products. If a renewal
24 application is not received by the department within 30 days after the expiration of a lease,
25 the leaseholder is responsible for removing all gear and products within 120 days.
26 When aquaculture has not been routinely or substantially conducted on a lease that is
27 proposed for renewal, the commissioner may renew the lease, as long as the proposed
28 renewal will continue to meet the criteria for approval in subsection 7‑A.
29 A lease renewal is an adjudicatory proceeding under Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 4.

38 of riparian land within 1,000 feet of the proposed location of the lease and to the municipal
39 officers of the municipality in which the lease is located. The applicant shall provide the
40 names and addresses of known owners of riparian land within 1,000 feet of the location of
