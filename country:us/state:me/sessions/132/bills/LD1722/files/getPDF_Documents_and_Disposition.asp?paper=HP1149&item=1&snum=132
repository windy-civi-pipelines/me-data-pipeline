15 Sec. 3. 12 MRSA §6072-A, sub-§20-A, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 564, §12, is

20 operations before the expiration of that limited-purpose lease, and if the commissioner does
21 not make a decision under section 6072, subsection 12‑D before the expiration of that

29 Sec. 4. Department of Marine Resources to amend rules and forms. The
30 Department of Marine Resources shall amend its rules and modify forms as necessary to
31 reflect the changes made by this Act related to the renewal of aquaculture leases under the
32 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 12, section 6072 and the conversion of a limited-purpose
33 lease for commercial aquaculture research and development under Title 12, section 6072,
34 subsection 12-D.
35 SUMMARY
3366 This bill amends provisions of law governing aquaculture leases. The bill changes the
3377 process for renewing a standard aquaculture lease, including the language that designates
3388 the renewal of a lease as an adjudicatory proceeding under the Maine Administrative
3399 Procedure Act, by replacing the existing process with language that requires the
4400 Commissioner of Marine Resources to renew the lease as soon as possible upon receipt of
4411 a complete application. A standard aquaculture lease refers to a lease granted under the
4422 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 12, section 6072.

1 The bill also replaces the existing process to convert a limited-purpose lease for
2 commercial aquaculture research and development to a standard aquaculture lease for the
3 same lease area and same operations authorized by the limited-purpose lease. The bill
4 requires the commissioner to approve the conversion as soon as possible upon receipt of a
5 complete application that meets those requirements.
6 The bill directs the Department of Marine Resources to update its rules and forms
7 consistent with this legislation.
