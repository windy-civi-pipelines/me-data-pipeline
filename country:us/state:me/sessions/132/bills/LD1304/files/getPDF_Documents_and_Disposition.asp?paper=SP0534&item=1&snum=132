26 property taxes to 2% each year on property owned as a primary residence
27 for at least 12 months by a resident of this State who is at least 65 years of
28 age and require the State to pay at least 90% of the revenue lost by a
29 municipality due to the cap on taxes using revenue from a 2% tax on lottery
30 tickets and sports betting?"
31 The legal voters of each city, town and plantation shall vote by ballot on this question
32 and designate their choice by a cross or check mark placed within the corresponding square
33 below the word "Yes" or "No." The ballots must be received, sorted, counted and declared

35 the same manner as votes for members of the Legislature. The Governor shall review the
36 returns. If it appears that a majority of the legal votes are cast in favor of the amendment,

1 SUMMARY
22 This resolution proposes to amend the Constitution of Maine to authorize the
33 Legislature to require taxes on property owned and occupied by a permanent resident of
44 this State for at least 12 months as that person's primary residence to be capped at 2% each
55 year if that person is at least 65 years of age. Upon transfer of the property to someone
66 other than a family member of the owner, the property would assume the just value at the
77 time of transfer. The State is required to reimburse municipalities for revenue lost due to
88 the 2% cap on taxes using revenue from a 2% tax imposed on the sale of lottery tickets and
99 sports betting.
