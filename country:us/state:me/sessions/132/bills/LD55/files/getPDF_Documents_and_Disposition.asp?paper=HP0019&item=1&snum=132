1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 26 MRSA §637, sub-§3, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 156, §3 and affected by
3 §4, is amended to read:
4 3. Accrual. An employee is entitled to earn one hour of paid leave from a single
5 employer for every 40 hours worked, up to 40 hours in the accrual limit specified in the
6 employer's policy governing paid leave for one year of employment. Accrual of leave
7 begins at the start of employment, but the employer is not required to permit use of the
8 leave before the employee has been employed by that employer for 120 days during a one-
9 year period. Accrued and unused hours of earned paid leave from the previous year of
10 employment must be available for use by an employee in the year of employment
11 immediately following that previous year. Accrued and unused hours of earned paid leave
12 carried forward from the previous year of employment may not reduce the total amount of
13 hours of paid leave an employee is entitled to earn in the year of employment immediately
14 following that previous year, up to the accrual limit specified in the employer's policy
15 governing paid leave.
