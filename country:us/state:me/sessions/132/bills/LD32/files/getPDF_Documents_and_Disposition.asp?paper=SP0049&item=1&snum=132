22 SUMMARY
2233 This bill repeals the laws that authorize the Public Utilities Commission to adopt rules
2244 governing net energy billing and that direct the commission to establish a net energy billing
2255 program for commercial and institutional customers of investor-owned transmission and
2266 distribution utilities. It prohibits the commission from adopting rules that require a
2277 transmission and distribution utility to allow a customer to participate in net energy billing.
2288 The bill also amends the laws that reference the net energy billing programs repealed by
2299 this bill, including repealing the provisions of law that provide for real estate and personal
3300 property tax exemptions for solar energy equipment used in connection with net energy
3311 billing customers.
