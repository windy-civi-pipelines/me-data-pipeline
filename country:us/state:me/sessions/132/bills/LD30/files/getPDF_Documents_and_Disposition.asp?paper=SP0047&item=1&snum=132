1 Preamble. Whereas, the State Railroad Preservation and Assistance Act requires
2 the Department of Transportation to seek legislative approval for any conversion of a
3 state-owned rail corridor in which the department controls the right-of-way to a nonrail
4 recreational or nonrecreational transportation use; and
5 Whereas, Public Law 2021, chapter 239 enacted the Maine Revised Statutes, Title
6 23, section 75, which gives the Commissioner of Transportation the authority to establish
7 a rail corridor use advisory council upon petition of one or more governmental entities; and
8 Whereas, the Department of Transportation received letters of support from all
9 communities along the section of the state-owned rail corridor known as the Berlin
10 Subdivision from the City of Portland to the town line between the City of Auburn and the
11 Town of New Gloucester requesting the formation of a rail corridor use advisory council;
12 and
13 Whereas, the Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council convened and met for 9
14 months in 2022 and early 2023; and
15 Whereas, the Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council voted to recommend the
16 interim conversion of the existing railroad track to a gravel, stone dust or paved bicycle and
17 pedestrian trail; and
18 Whereas, the State Railroad Preservation and Assistance Act further requires that,
19 once the Commissioner of Transportation receives a report from a rail corridor use advisory
20 council that includes a recommendation of track removal or other change for interim
21 nonrail use and the commissioner concurs with that recommendation, the commissioner
22 seek legislative approval of the recommendation by submitting legislation to the joint
23 standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over transportation matters prior
24 to the track removal or other change for interim nonrail use; and
25 Whereas, any track removal or other change for nonrail use is considered interim in
26 nature and rail corridors are to be preserved for future rail use as provided under the State
27 Railroad Preservation and Assistance Act; now, therefore, be it
28 Sec. 1. Trail construction on Berlin Subdivision. Resolved: That, based on the
29 majority recommendation of the Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council and
30 pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 23, section 7107, the Department of
31 Transportation shall, subject to available funding resources, permitting and municipal
32 agreements, remove 9.95 miles of state-owned inactive existing railroad track along the
33 section known as the Berlin Subdivision between the City of Portland, from a point north
34 of the swing bridge at Back Cove in Portland at or near mile marker 1.7, and Royal River
35 Park on East Elm Street in the Town of Yarmouth, located at or near rail mile marker 11.65,
36 and replace the track with an interim bicycle and pedestrian trail surfaced with pavement
37 or gravel or stone dust on the existing rail bed.
