1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the scallop season in Maine is closed for a majority of the year, typically
4 open only in select zones and on specific days between December and April; and
5 Whereas, Maine residents' ability to harvest scallops has been challenged in recent
6 years by extreme and dangerous weather, resulting in lost fishing days; and
7 Whereas, allowing the Commissioner of Marine Resources to add up to 5 limited-
8 access area days during the scallop season could help counteract losses that have resulted
9 from lost fishing days and aid scallop population management efforts; and
10 Whereas, it is necessary for this legislation to take effect before the scallop season
11 ends; and
12 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
13 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
14 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
15 therefore,
