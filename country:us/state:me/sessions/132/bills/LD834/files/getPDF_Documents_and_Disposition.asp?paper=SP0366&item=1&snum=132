19 SUMMARY
2200 This bill amends the 1974 State Supplemental Income Act in the following ways.
21 1. It changes the minimum state supplemental income benefit from $8 per month for
22 an individual and $12 per month for a couple to $65 per month for an individual and an
23 amount per couple that is consistent with the amount provided to an individual and to a
24 couple under current law, which requires benefits for a couple to be 150% of the benefit
25 for an individual, making the new amount $97.50 per month for a couple.
26 2. It provides that, starting October 1, 2026, the state supplemental income benefit
27 must be annually increased by the cost-of-living adjustment to the federal payment
28 standard.
29 3. It provides that, in the priority sequence by which the Department of Health and
30 Human Services must budget and authorize for expenditure appropriations available for
31 benefits, the cost-of-living adjustment must have priority immediately after the minimum
32 payment.
33 4. It updates the declared intent of the Act to provide that, if it is proposed that benefits
34 provided are to be increased on any future date, cost-of-living adjustments be included in
35 the benefits to be increased rather than increasing the benefits provided to a beneficiary
36 who resides in certain living arrangements.
37 5. It requires the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that eligible
38 individuals residing in nursing homes have a monthly amount for personal needs equal to
39 at least 3 times the amount of the state supplemental income benefit.
