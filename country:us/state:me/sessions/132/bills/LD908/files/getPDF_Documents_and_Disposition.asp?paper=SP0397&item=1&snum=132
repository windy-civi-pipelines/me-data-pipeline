1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 CONCEPT DRAFT
3 SUMMARY
44 This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5 This bill proposes to eliminate the 8% sales tax on all prepared foods, including meals
6 served in restaurants, for the purpose of boosting economic activity by making dining out
7 more affordable. The Department of Economic and Community Development would be
8 required to initiate an advertising campaign to encourage tourism in Maine and promote
9 dining establishments as tax-free, with the exception of alcoholic beverages.
10 The loss of revenue from the repeal of the sales tax on prepared foods would be offset
11 in a number of ways, including:
12 1. Broadening the items subject to sales tax and increasing the rate of the sales tax on
13 certain high-end luxury items, such as bicycles, boating gear and other recreational
14 equipment; high-end electronics, such as smartphones and laptops; and elective medical
15 procedures that are not medically necessary;
16 2. Performing an assessment of sales tax exemptions on nonessential goods and
17 services to ensure that only those exemptions that are intended to provide a fair system of
18 taxation are retained; and
19 3. Conducting a comprehensive audit of state government programs and expenditures
20 to eliminate inefficiencies and waste.
