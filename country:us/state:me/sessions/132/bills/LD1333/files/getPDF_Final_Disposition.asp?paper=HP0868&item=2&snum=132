2200 benefits program.
21 1. It requires an employee to be employed with an employer for 120 days before being

23 2. It clarifies that intermittent leave of an employee of less than one work day may not
24 be taken unless it is agreed to by the employee and the employer.
25 3. It provides examples of what type of conditions constitute undue hardship for an
26 employer and allows an employer to determine other conditions, based on that employer's
27 specific business, that constitute undue hardship. It also provides that the decision of an
28 employer to deny the requested scheduling of leave based on the examples provided is not
29 reviewable by the Department of Labor. It clarifies that a decision of an employer to deny
30 the scheduling of leave based on undue hardship for any condition other than the examples
31 is reviewable by the department.
32 4. It applies the same delay of implementation to private employers with collective
33 bargaining agreements as currently applies to public employers.
34 5. It prohibits the taking of paid leave unless the employee simultaneously takes any
35 available unpaid leave.

37 Department of Labor to administer the paid family and medical leave benefits program.

6 10. It changes the applications of penalties against employers from mandatory to
7 discretionary.
8 11. It establishes remedies for the Department of Labor to enforce the collection of
9 delinquent premium contributions, penalties and assessments on employers that fail to

11 12. It establishes liability for individuals or organizations with respect to premium
12 contributions, penalties and assessments owed by employers acquired by those individuals
