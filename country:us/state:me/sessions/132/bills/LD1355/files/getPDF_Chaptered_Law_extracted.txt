Sec. 1. Governor's Energy Office to examine and evaluate system of
taxation of renewable energy infrastructure and possible adoption of uniform
capacity tax for renewable energy infrastructure. Resolved: That the Governor's
Energy Office shall examine and evaluate the current system of taxation of renewable
energy infrastructure and possible adoption of a uniform capacity tax for renewable energy
infrastructure. The study must include an examination and evaluation of:

taxes on renewable energy infrastructure, including, but not limited to, solar photovoltaic
systems, wind energy development and battery energy storage systems;

Section 3:
2. The history of municipal and county taxation of renewable energy infrastructure in
the State, as well as in other states;

Section 4:
3. How tax revenue from new renewable energy infrastructure projects may affect
state-municipal revenue-sharing formulas, including the effect of renewable energy
infrastructure value depreciation;

Section 5:
4. Whether renewable energy infrastructure presents special difficulties with
identifying just value;

Section 6:
5. What tax amount per megawatt of electric generation capacity of renewable energy
infrastructure projects, if any, would fairly compensate municipalities without making such
projects unviable;

Section 7:
6. The current use, complexity, cost and appropriateness of programs such as tax
increment financing and credit enhancement agreements for renewable energy
infrastructure and whether an alternative program may benefit municipalities, counties and
renewable energy infrastructure development in the State; and

Section 8:
7. Whether a uniform taxation of renewable energy infrastructure and exclusion of
such revenue from state-municipal revenue-sharing formulas may encourage renewable
energy infrastructure development, advance the State's clean energy goals and benefit
municipalities and counties in the State.

including findings, recommendations and any suggested legislation, based on the study to
the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over taxation matters.
The joint standing committee may report out legislation related to the report to the 133rd
Legislature in 2027.
Sec. 2. Funding. Resolved: That the Governor's Energy Office may receive funds,
grants or contributions from public or private sources to carry out the study required under

Section 9:
section 1. The Governor's Energy Office shall disclose its sources of funding as part of the
