11 incomplete, the board shall notify the applicant no later than 10 days after making that

17 cannot reasonably be processed as required by subsection 1, the board may take an
18 additional 15 calendar days to decide to grant or deny a license application.
19 3. Report to the Legislature. Beginning February 1, 2026 and annually thereafter,

26 notification to the applicant of the board's decision pursuant to subsection 1; and
27 C. The number of applications subject to an extended review pursuant to subsection 2.

29 board is unable to comply with the time frames provided in this section, notwithstanding
30 any provision in this chapter to the contrary, the commissioner shall review the board's
31 actions and implement necessary corrections, including, but not limited to, transferring the
32 duties of the board to consider license applications for emergency medical services persons,
33 emergency medical services ambulance operators and emergency medical dispatchers to
