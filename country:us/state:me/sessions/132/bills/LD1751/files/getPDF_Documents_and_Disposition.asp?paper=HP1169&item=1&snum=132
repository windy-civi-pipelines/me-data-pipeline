17 A. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, identify and designate geographic
18 areas in the municipality or multimunicipal region as growth areas and rural areas, as
19 defined in this chapter.
20 (1) Within growth areas, each municipality or multimunicipal region shall:
21 (a) Establish development standards;
22 (b) Establish timely permitting procedures;
23 (c) Ensure that needed public services are available; and
24 (d) Prevent inappropriate development in natural hazard areas, including flood
25 plains and areas of high erosion.
26 (2) Within rural areas, each municipality or multimunicipal region shall adopt land
27 use policies and ordinances to discourage incompatible development. These
28 policies and ordinances may include, without limitation, density limits, cluster or
29 special zoning, acquisition of land or development rights, transfer of development
30 rights pursuant to section 4328 and performance standards. The municipality or
31 multimunicipal region should also identify which rural areas qualify as critical
32 rural areas as defined in this chapter. Critical rural areas must receive priority
33 consideration for proactive strategies designed to enhance rural industries, manage
34 wildlife and fisheries habitat and preserve sensitive natural areas.
35 (3) A municipality or multimunicipal region may also designate as a transitional
36 area any portion of land area that does not meet the definition of either a growth
37 area or a rural area. Such an area may be appropriate for medium-density
38 development that does not require expansion of municipal facilities and does not
39 include significant rural resources.
40 (4) A municipality or multimunicipal region is not required to identify growth
41 areas within the municipality or multimunicipal region for residential, commercial
42 or industrial growth if it demonstrates, in accordance with rules adopted by the
43 department pursuant to this article, that:
Page 6 - 132LR1666(01)

22 routine technical rules pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.
23 Sec. 41. 30-A MRSA §4347-A, sub-§3-A, as amended by PL 2011, c. 655, Pt. JJ,
24 §21 and affected by §41, is further amended by amending the 3rd blocked paragraph to
25 read:
26 A finding by the department pursuant to paragraph D that a comprehensive plan is
27 consistent with the procedures, goals and guidelines established in this subchapter is valid
28 for 12 years from the date of its issuance. A finding by the former State Planning Office
29 department issued pursuant to this subchapter prior to December 31, 2000 after January 1,
30 2013 that a comprehensive plan is consistent with the procedures, goals and guidelines
31 established in this subchapter is valid until December 31, 2012 2028 or 12 years after the
32 date of consistency determined by the department, whichever is later. For purposes of
33 section 4314, subsection 3 and section 4352, subsection 2, expiration of a finding of
34 consistency pursuant to this subsection does not itself make a comprehensive plan
35 inconsistent with the procedures, goals and guidelines established in this subchapter.

8 municipality's or multimunicipal region's submission and the department authorizes that
9 application.
