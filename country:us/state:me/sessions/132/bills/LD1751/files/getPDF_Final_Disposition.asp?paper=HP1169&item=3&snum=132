strategy section that contains a timetable for the implementation program, including land
use ordinances, ensuring that the goals established under this subchapter are met. These
implementation strategies must be consistent with state law and guidelines for the
implementation program as described in subsection 5 and must actively promote policies
developed during the planning process. The timetable must identify significant ordinances
to be included in the implementation program. The strategies and timetable must guide the
subsequent adoption of policies, programs and land use ordinances, including a capital
investment plan for the replacement and expansion of public facilities and services required
to meet projected growth and development, and periodic review of the comprehensive plan.
The department shall develop and maintain a catalog of implementation strategies
appropriate for various place types.
3-A. Guidelines for policy development and implementation strategies. In
developing its strategies and subsequent policies, programs and land use ordinances, each
municipality or multimunicipal region shall employ the following guidelines consistent
with the goals of this subchapter:
A. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, identify and designate geographic
areas in the municipality or multimunicipal region as growth areas and rural areas, as
defined in this chapter.
(1) Within growth areas, each municipality or multimunicipal region shall:
(a) Establish development standards;
(b) Establish timely permitting procedures;
(c) Ensure that needed public services are available; and
(d) Prevent inappropriate development in natural hazard areas, including flood
plains and areas of high erosion.

consideration for proactive strategies designed to enhance rural industries, manage
wildlife and fisheries habitat and preserve sensitive natural areas.
(3) A municipality or multimunicipal region may also designate as a transitional
area any portion of land area that does not meet the definition of either a growth
area or a rural area. Such an area may be appropriate for medium-density
development that does not require expansion of municipal facilities and does not
include significant rural resources.
(4) A municipality or multimunicipal region is not required to identify growth
areas within the municipality or multimunicipal region for residential, commercial
or industrial growth if it demonstrates, in accordance with rules adopted by the
department pursuant to this article, that:

comprehensive plan adopted or to be adopted by one or more other municipalities or
multimunicipal regions in accordance with an interlocal agreement adopted in
accordance with chapter 115 with one or more municipalities or multimunicipal
regions. This information may be presented in a narrative or map form.
B. A future land use plan may designate any portion of land area that is not a growth
area or a rural area as a transitional area and as appropriate for medium-density
development that does not require expansion of municipal facilities and does not
include significant rural resources.
C. A future land use plan may identify and designate more place types to provide
further guidance on the establishment or modification of a municipality's or
multimunicipal region's rate of growth ordinance, zoning ordinance or impact fee
ordinance.
D. A future land use plan is not required to identify growth areas within the
municipality or multimunicipal region for residential, commercial or industrial growth
if the municipality or multimunicipal region demonstrates, in its comprehensive plan
and in accordance with rules adopted by the department pursuant to this article, that:
(1) It is not possible to accommodate future residential, commercial or industrial
growth within the municipality or multimunicipal region because of severe
physical limitations, including, without limitation, the lack of adequate water
