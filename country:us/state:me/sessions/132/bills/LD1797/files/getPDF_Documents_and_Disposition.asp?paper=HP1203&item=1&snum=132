1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 1 MRSA §408-A, sub-§4, as repealed and replaced by PL 2015, c. 494, Pt.
3 A, §1, is amended to read:
4 4. Refusals; denials. If a body or an agency or official having custody or control of
5 any public record refuses permission to inspect or copy or abstract a public record, the body
6 or agency or official shall provide, within 5 working days of the receipt of the request for
7 inspection or copying, written notice of the denial, stating the reason for the denial or the
8 expectation that the request will be denied in full or in part following a review. A written
9 notice of a denial must contain a citation to the statutory authority used as the basis for the
10 denial. A request for inspection or copying may be denied, in whole or in part, on the basis
11 that the request is unduly burdensome or oppressive if the procedures established in
12 subsection 4‑A are followed. Failure to comply with this subsection is considered failure
13 to allow inspection or copying and is subject to appeal as provided in section 409.
14 SUMMARY

2233 transparency in the legislative review of the proposals contained in the bill.
24 The bill requires that a written notice of a denial of a request for inspection or copying
25 of a public record include a citation to the statutory authority used as the basis for the denial.
