33 SUMMARY
3344 This bill amends certain provisions of law governing child welfare to establish that
3355 when an adult living in a child's home has been convicted of a crime of violence and has
3366 not completed a certified domestic violence intervention program, that situation represents
3377 jeopardy and serious harm to the child and is an example of behavior showing that a parent
3388 is currently unwilling or unable to meet the child's needs. Specifically, the bill amends the
3399 definitions of "jeopardy" and "serious harm" under the Child and Family Services and Child
4400 Protection Act and amends the provisions of law governing the criteria a court may use to
4411 appoint a guardian for a minor.

1 The bill amends provisions governing child jeopardy hearings to create 2 rebuttable
2 presumptions. The first presumption provides that allowing contact with the person seeking
3 custody or contact with the child would create a situation of jeopardy if that person has
4 been convicted of a crime of violence and has not completed a certified domestic violence
5 intervention program. The 2nd presumption provides that a parent or person responsible
6 for a child creates a situation of jeopardy for the child if the parent or person allows,
7 encourages or fails to prevent contact between the child and a person who has been
8 convicted of a crime of violence and has not completed a certified domestic violence
9 intervention program. In each case, the person against whom the presumption applies may
10 produce evidence to rebut the presumption.
