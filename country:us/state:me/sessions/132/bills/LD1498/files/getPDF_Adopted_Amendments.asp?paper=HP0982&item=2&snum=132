19 an additional 84,000 homes in the next 5 years to alleviate this crisis, housing production

28 and
29 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within

1 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section
2 number to read consecutively.
3 SUMMARY
44 This amendment changes the title of the bill and adds an emergency preamble and
55 emergency clause. The amendment amends the time within which a municipality must
66 encumber an impact fee from 180 days, as proposed in the bill, to 360 days after receipt.
77 The amendment changes "capital improvements" to "infrastructure improvements"
88 throughout the provisions of law amended in the bill to provide consistency. The
99 amendment removes the limitation proposed in the bill that impact fees must be related to
1100 infrastructure improvements on land or property that directly abuts the development. The
1111 amendment repeals the provisions of law that established the Housing Opportunity
1122 Program within the Department of Economic and Community Development and
1133 establishes the program in the Maine Office of Community Affairs. The amendment
1144 includes an appropriations and allocations section to accomplish this transfer.
