an impact fee may be imposed that results in a developer or developers paying the entire
cost of an infrastructure improvement. A municipality may impose an impact fee either
before or after completing the infrastructure improvement. The municipality shall establish
a policy document, accessible at the office of the municipality or on the publicly accessible
website of the municipality, that describes the manner by which the municipality
determines that a development necessitates an infrastructure improvement and how the
developer's share of the cost of that improvement is determined.
Sec. 2. 30-A MRSA §4354, sub-§1, as amended by PL 1999, c. 776, §11, is further

construction of capital infrastructure improvements or impact fees instead of capital
infrastructure improvements including the expansion or replacement of existing
infrastructure facilities and the construction of new infrastructure facilities. A municipality
shall demonstrate that a required infrastructure improvement is necessary to accommodate
the development and that the impact fee is based on the cost of the infrastructure
improvement and proportionate to the development's use of the infrastructure
improvement.
A. For the purposes of this subsection, infrastructure facilities include, but are not
limited to:
(1) Waste water collection and treatment facilities;

is required to use encumber the funds within 360 days of receipt and in a manner
consistent with the capital investment component of the comprehensive plan.
