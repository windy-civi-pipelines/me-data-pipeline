18 standards of practice.
19 Sec. 14. 32 MRSA §19605, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 580, §8, is amended to read:

23 standards of practice and appropriate restrictions for the various types and forms of
24 telehealth services.
25 SUMMARY
2266 This bill amends provisions of the law governing optometrists.
27 The bill provides a more detailed explanation of what constitutes the practice of
28 optometry. The definition of "practice of optometry" in current law does not include
29 surgical procedures. Under the bill, certain types of ophthalmic surgeries are included in
30 the practice of optometry and certain procedures are specifically excluded. An optometrist
31 may only perform ophthalmic surgery if the optometrist meets credentialing requirements
32 established by the State Board of Optometry. The bill also broadens the authority of an
33 optometrist to dispense drugs by expanding the types of drugs an optometrist may dispense
34 to include schedule II narcotics limited to pharmaceuticals containing specified doses of
35 hydrocodone combined with doses of another drug and by removing language that prohibits
36 an optometrist from administering drugs by injection or intravenously. The bill directs the
37 board to adopt rules to further define the scope of practice of optometry and establish
38 credentialing requirements for surgical procedures.
39 The bill clarifies that the board, and no other board or commission in the State, has the
40 authority to define the scope of practice of optometry and to exercise the powers of the
41 board. The bill authorizes the board to issue advisory opinions and declaratory rulings.
Page 5 - 132LR1434(01)
1 The bill also makes minor changes to the provisions relating to telehealth services and
2 filling contact lense and spectacle prescriptions.

25 SUMMARY
2266 This bill amends provisions of the law governing optometrists.
27 The bill provides a more detailed explanation of what constitutes the practice of
28 optometry. The definition of "practice of optometry" in current law does not include
29 surgical procedures. Under the bill, certain types of ophthalmic surgeries are included in
30 the practice of optometry and certain procedures are specifically excluded. An optometrist
31 may only perform ophthalmic surgery if the optometrist meets credentialing requirements
32 established by the State Board of Optometry. The bill also broadens the authority of an
33 optometrist to dispense drugs by expanding the types of drugs an optometrist may dispense
34 to include schedule II narcotics limited to pharmaceuticals containing specified doses of
35 hydrocodone combined with doses of another drug and by removing language that prohibits
36 an optometrist from administering drugs by injection or intravenously. The bill directs the
37 board to adopt rules to further define the scope of practice of optometry and establish
38 credentialing requirements for surgical procedures.
39 The bill clarifies that the board, and no other board or commission in the State, has the
40 authority to define the scope of practice of optometry and to exercise the powers of the
41 board. The bill authorizes the board to issue advisory opinions and declaratory rulings.
