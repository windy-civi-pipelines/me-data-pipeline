1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, current interpretation of authorized lucky seven or similar sealed ticket
4 games does not include games designed by the manufacturer to include a jackpot prize that
5 is carried over to a subsequent series of tickets or cards with the same form number in the
6 event that jackpot prize is not won, also known as progressive pull-tab games, despite
7 historical practice allowing such games; and
8 Whereas, many eligible nonprofit organizations have already registered with the
9 Department of Public Safety's Gambling Control Unit to offer such games and not being
10 able to offer progressive pull-tab games will result in a negative financial impact; and
11 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
12 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
13 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
