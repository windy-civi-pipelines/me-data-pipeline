Games and to Offer Partner-assisted Beano
Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, current interpretation of sealed ticket games does not include games
designed by the manufacturer to include a jackpot prize that is carried over to a subsequent
series of tickets or cards with the same form number in the event that jackpot prize is not
won, also known as progressive pull-tab games, despite historical practice allowing such
games; and
Whereas, many eligible nonprofit organizations have already registered with the
Department of Public Safety's Gambling Control Unit to offer such games and not being
able to offer progressive pull-tab games will result in a negative financial impact; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
