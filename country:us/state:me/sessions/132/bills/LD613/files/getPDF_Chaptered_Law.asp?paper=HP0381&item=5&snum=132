2nd oral request, the attending physician shall offer the qualified patient an opportunity to
rescind the request. The date the qualified patient signs the written request must be no
earlier than 15 days after the initial oral request. At least 48 hours must elapse between the
date the qualified patient signs the written request and the writing of a prescription under
this Act.
The attending physician may waive a portion of the waiting periods required in this
subsection if, in the attending physician's medical opinion, it is in the best interests of the
qualified patient, given the qualified patient's condition, as long as the waiting period in
total is no less than 7 days.
