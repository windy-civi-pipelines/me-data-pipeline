31 3. The effect of adopting so-called look-through apportionment for certain types of
32 services to determine where sales are sourced; and
33 4. The availability of reasonable approximation safe harbor provisions that allow
34 corporations to calculate tax liability by using an estimate of where a general group of
35 customers are located to determine where revenue is sourced instead of determining where
36 each individual customer is located.
37 Sec. 6. Staff assistance. Resolved: That the Legislative Council shall provide
38 necessary staffing services to the commission, except that Legislative Council staff support
39 is not authorized when the Legislature is in regular or special session.

423 on whether existing tax laws authorize the Department of Administrative and Financial

445 legislation is needed to effectuate the commission's recommendations. The Joint Standing
456 Committee on Taxation may submit legislation related to the report to the Second Regular
467 Session of the 132nd Legislature.
