36 on a limited access state highway within a highway work zone in which the speed limit,
37 established using generally accepted traffic engineering practices, is 45 miles per hour or
38 greater.
39 2. A system may be used if:
40 A. The system is operated by an operator;
Page 1 - 132LR1457(01)
1 B. In accordance with a manual of uniform traffic control devices approved and revised
2 by the authority, at least 2 conspicuous road signs are placed at a reasonable distance

10 3. A system may be used only to record images of motor vehicles that are exceeding
11 the posted highway work zone speed limit by 11 miles per hour or more in violation of the
12 provisions of section 4. Any recorded images collected as part of a system may not be used
13 for any surveillance purpose. The authority or operator shall certify to the Department of

10 reasonable grounds to believe that a violation has occurred, the member may issue a notice
11 of violation for the alleged violation. The notice of violation must be sworn or affirmed by
12 the member and is prima facie evidence of the facts contained in the notice. The notice of
13 violation must include written verification that the system was operating correctly at the
14 time of the alleged violation and specify the date of the most recent inspection that confirms
15 the system to be operating properly.
16 Sec. 6. Operator training and duties; system calibration. Resolved: That:
17 1. An operator shall complete training offered by the manufacturer of a system or the
18 manufacturer's representative in the procedures for setting up, testing and operating the
19 system, including training on any device critical to the operation of the system. Upon

33 Sec. 7. Notice of violation. Resolved: That:
34 1. The notice of violation for an alleged violation of section 4 must include:
35 A. A copy of the recorded image showing the motor vehicle with the motor vehicle's
36 license plate visible;
37 B. The registration number and state of issuance of the motor vehicle registration;
38 C. Verification that the system was operating correctly at the time of the alleged
39 violation and the date of the most recent calibration check under section 6, subsection
40 3; and
41 D. The date, time and location of the alleged violation;
Page 3 - 132LR1457(01)
1 2. For an alleged violation of section 4 involving a motor vehicle registered in the State,
2 the notice of violation must be mailed not later than 30 days after the commission of the

4 whichever is later, to the address of the owner that is in the records of the Department of
5 the Secretary of State, Bureau of Motor Vehicles;
6 3. For an alleged violation of section 4 involving a motor vehicle registered in another

8 identity of the owner of the motor vehicle is ascertained to the address of the owner that is
9 in the records of the official in the other jurisdiction issuing the registration;
10 4. The notice of violation for an alleged violation of section 4 is invalid unless the
11 notice is mailed to the owner of the motor vehicle no later than 90 days after the alleged
12 violation of section 4; and
13 5. The notice of violation for an alleged violation of section 4 must be sent by first-
14 class mail. A manual or automatic record of mailing prepared by the operator in the
15 ordinary course of business is prima facie evidence of mailing and is admissible in any
16 court proceeding as to the facts contained in the notice.
17 Sec. 8. Defenses. Resolved: That the following defenses are available to the owner
18 of a motor vehicle identified by a system as allegedly violating section 4:

28 SUMMARY
2299 This resolve authorizes the Maine Turnpike Authority to conduct a pilot program to
3300 implement up to 3 automated speed control systems at a time in highway work zones on
3311 limited access highways in the State for 3 years. The system produces an image of a motor
3322 vehicle exceeding the posted speed limit by 11 miles an hour or more in the highway work
3333 zone, including the motor vehicle's license plate number, and a notice of violation is sent
3344 to the owner of the motor vehicle, who is subject to a warning for a first offense and a fine
3355 for a 2nd or subsequent offense. The system is maintained by an operator who is responsible
3366 for calibrating the system and certifying that the system is in proper working order.
3377 Personally identifiable information of motor vehicle owners and motor vehicles captured
3388 by the system is confidential and not a public record under the Freedom of Access Act.

28 SUMMARY
2299 This resolve authorizes the Maine Turnpike Authority to conduct a pilot program to
3300 implement up to 3 automated speed control systems at a time in highway work zones on
3311 limited access highways in the State for 3 years. The system produces an image of a motor
3322 vehicle exceeding the posted speed limit by 11 miles an hour or more in the highway work
3333 zone, including the motor vehicle's license plate number, and a notice of violation is sent
3344 to the owner of the motor vehicle, who is subject to a warning for a first offense and a fine
3355 for a 2nd or subsequent offense. The system is maintained by an operator who is responsible
3366 for calibrating the system and certifying that the system is in proper working order.
3377 Personally identifiable information of motor vehicle owners and motor vehicles captured
3388 by the system is confidential and not a public record under the Freedom of Access Act.
