29 SUMMARY
3300 This bill treats the real estate transfer tax on the sale of mobile home parks differently

3322 are not subject to the real estate transfer tax. The real estate transfer tax received by the
3333 State from buyers of mobile home parks is allocated entirely to the Housing Opportunities
3344 for Maine Fund within the Maine State Housing Authority.
