24 space land for which it qualifies under section 1102, subsection 6, adjusted by the certified
25 ratio.
26 2. Alternative valuation method. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the
27 contrary, if an assessor is unable to determine the valuation of open space land under the
28 valuation method in subsection 1, the assessor may value that land under the alternative
29 method in this subsection. The assessor may reduce the ordinary assessed valuation of the
30 land, without regard to conservation easement restrictions and as reduced by the certified
31 ratio, by the cumulative percentage reduction for which the land is eligible according to the
32 following categories.

3 A wildlife habitat management plan must be presented with the application for
4 enrollment of eligible acres but remains confidential and is not a public record as
5 defined in Title 1, section 402, subsection 3.
6 A wildlife habitat management plan presented with the application is subject to the
7 following conditions:
8 (1) The plan must have been reviewed and certified by a licensed professional
9 forester as consistent with sound silvicultural practices;
10 (2) The implementation of the silvicultural measures identified in the plan must
11 be supervised and certified by a licensed professional forester; and
12 (3) The plan must be updated at least once every 10 years. The updated plan must
13 include all information required in the original plan, including recommended
14 practices for the next planning period. The plan update must also include a review
15 and certification that practices recommended in the previous planning period have
16 been completed.
17 G. Open space land on which an approved forest climate resilience and carbon
18 management plan has been completed is eligible for the reduction set in paragraph A
19 or D and an additional 25%. A forest climate resilience and carbon management plan
20 must be presented with the application for enrollment of eligible acres but remains
21 confidential and is not a public record as defined in Title 1, section 402, subsection 3.
22 A forest climate resilience and carbon management plan presented with an application
23 is subject to the following conditions:
24 (1) The plan must have been reviewed and certified by a licensed professional
25 forester as consistent with sound silvicultural practices;
26 (2) The implementation of the silvicultural measures identified in the plan must
27 be supervised and certified by a licensed professional forester; and
28 (3) The plan must be updated at least once every 10 years. The updated plan must
29 include all information required in the original plan, including recommended
30 practices for the next planning period. The plan update must also include a review

34 less than the value it would have under subchapter 2‑A, and the open space land valuation
35 may not exceed just value as required under section 701‑A.
36 3. Definition of land eligible for additional percentage reduction. The following
37 categories of open space land are eligible for the additional percentage reduction set forth
38 in subsection 2, paragraphs B, C, D, F and E G.
39 A. Permanently protected open space is an area of open space land that is eligible for
40 an additional cumulative percentage reduction in valuation because that area is subject

42 easement pursuant to Title 33, chapter 7, subchapter 8‑A or as an open space preserve
Page 3 - 132LR2008(01)

413 owned and operated by a nonprofit entity in accordance with section 1109, subsection
424 3, paragraph H.
3 B. Forever wild open space is an area of open space land that is eligible for an
4 additional cumulative percentage reduction in valuation because it is permanently
5 protected and subject to restrictions or committed to uses by a nonprofit entity in
6 accordance with section 1109, subsection 3, paragraph H that ensure that in the future
7 the natural resources on that protected property will remain substantially unaltered,
8 except for:
9 (1) Fishing or hunting;
10 (2) Harvesting shellfish in the intertidal zone;
11 (3) Prevention of the spread of fires or disease; or
12 (4) Providing opportunities for low-impact outdoor recreation, nature observation
13 and study.
14 C. Public access open space is an area of open space land, whether ordinary, or
15 permanently protected or forever wild, that is eligible for an additional cumulative
16 percentage reduction in valuation because public access is by reasonable means and
17 the applicant agrees to refrain from taking action to discourage or prohibit daytime,
18 nonmotorized and nondestructive public use. The applicant may permit, but is not
19 obligated to permit as a condition of qualification for public access status, hunting,
20 snowmobiling, overnight use or other more intensive outdoor recreational uses. The
21 applicant, without disqualifying land from status as public access open space, may
22 impose temporary or localized public access restrictions to:
23 (1) Protect active habitat of endangered species listed under Title 12, chapter 925,
24 subchapter 3;
25 (2) Prevent destruction or harm to fragile protected natural resources under Title
26 38, chapter 3, subchapter 1, article 5‑A; or
27 (3) Protect the recreational user from any hazardous area.
28 D. Managed forest open space land is an area of open space land whether ordinary,
29 permanently protected pursuant to paragraph A or public access pursuant to paragraph
30 C containing at least 10 acres of forested land that is eligible for an additional
31 cumulative percentage reduction in valuation because the applicant has provided proof
32 of a forest management and harvest plan. A forest management and harvest plan must
33 be prepared for each parcel of managed forest open space land and updated every 10
34 years. The landowner must comply with the forest management and harvest plan and
35 must submit every 10 years to the municipal assessor for parcels in a municipality or
36 the State Tax Assessor for parcels in the unorganized territory a statement from a
37 licensed professional forester that the landowner is managing the parcel according to
38 the forest management and harvest plan. Failure to comply with the forest management
39 and harvest plan results in the loss of the additional cumulative percentage reduction
40 under this paragraph for 10 years. The assessor or the assessor's duly authorized
41 representative may enter and examine the forested land and may examine any
42 information in the forest management and harvest plan submitted by the owner. A
43 copy of the forest management and harvest plan must be made available to the assessor
44 to review upon request. For the purposes of this paragraph, "to review" means to see
Page 4 - 132LR2008(01)

415 or possess a copy of a forest management and harvest plan for a reasonable amount of
426 time to verify that the forest management and harvest plan exists or to facilitate an
437 evaluation as to whether the forest management and harvest plan is appropriate and is
448 being followed. Upon completion of a review, the forest management and harvest plan
459 must be returned to the owner or an agent of the owner. A forest management and
560 harvest plan provided in accordance with this section is confidential and is not a public
571 record as defined in Title 1, section 402, subsection 3.
8 Sec. 10. 36 MRSA §1109, sub-§3, ¶O, as enacted by PL 2003, c. 619, §4 and
9 amended by PL 2011, c. 657, Pt. W, §5, is further amended to read:
10 O. Whether there is a written management agreement between the landowner and the
11 Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife or the Department of Agriculture,
12 Conservation and Forestry as described in section 1102, subsection 10 11.
13 Sec. 11. 36 MRSA §1114, as enacted by PL 1975, c. 726, §2, is amended to read:
14 §1114. Application
15 No person can A landowner may not apply for classification for more than an aggregate
16 total of 15,000 acres under this subchapter, unless the landowner is a nonprofit organization
17 that has been determined by the United States Internal Revenue Service to be exempt from
18 taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code. The classification of farmland or open space
19 land hereunder shall continue under this subchapter continues until the municipal assessor,
20 or State Tax Assessor in the unorganized territory, determine determines that the land no
21 longer meets the requirements of such the classification.
22 SUMMARY
2233 This bill makes changes to the valuation method for the open space tax law. It extends
2244 eligibility for a reduced valuation to land managed under a forest climate resilience and
2255 carbon management plan and to land on which an approved wildlife habitat management
2266 plan has been certified. The bill allows a landowner determined to be a nonprofit
2277 organization by the United States Internal Revenue Service to apply for classification for
2288 more than an aggregate total of 15,000 acres under the laws governing the valuation of
2299 open space land.
30 This bill also:
31 1. Increases the amount of the reduction of property taxes that land enrolled as open
32 space is eligible for from 20% to 45% and reduces the additional reduction of property
33 taxes that permanently protected open space land is eligible for from 30% to 25%;
34 2. Eliminates the additional percentage reduction in property taxes that forever wild
35 open space land and managed forest open space land is eligible for; and
36 3. Provides an additional 25% reduction in property taxes to open space land for which
37 an approved wildlife habitat management plan or forest climate resilience and carbon
38 management plan has been completed.
