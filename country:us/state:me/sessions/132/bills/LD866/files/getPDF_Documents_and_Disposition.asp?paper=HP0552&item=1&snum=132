1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 12 MRSA §11152, sub-§4, as amended by PL 2021, c. 599, §11, is further
3 amended to read:
4 4. Landowner consideration. An antlerless deer permit lottery adopted by the
5 commissioner pursuant to this section may include a provision giving special consideration
6 to landowners who keep their lands open to hunting by the public. As part of the special
7 consideration to those landowners, the commissioner shall provide at least 25% of the
8 available antlerless deer permits in a wildlife management district at no cost to eligible
9 landowners that apply for an antlerless deer permit in that district. Any 2 or more areas of
10 land owned by the same person that are open for hunting and that would be contiguous
11 except for being divided by one or more roads are considered contiguous for the purposes
12 of determining landowner eligibility for special consideration under this subsection. If an
13 eligible landowner is unsuccessful in obtaining an antlerless deer permit through this
14 process but is successful in obtaining a permit through other means, that permit must be
15 provided to the landowner at no cost.
16 Sec. 2. 12 MRSA §11152, sub-§9, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 599, §11, is amended
17 to read:
18 9. Fee. The fee for an antlerless deer permit is $12 for residents and nonresidents,
19 except that a landowner who keeps the landowner's lands open to hunting by the public and
20 who successfully obtains an antlerless deer permit through the process outlined in
21 subsection 4 is entitled to receive one permit at no cost.
22 SUMMARY
2233 This bill amends the law governing the antlerless deer permit lottery to provide that a
2244 landowner who keeps the landowner's lands open to hunting by the public and applies for
2255 an antlerless deer permit and is successful in obtaining a permit is not charged for the
2266 permit. The bill also adds language to require that such a landowner who is unsuccessful
2277 in obtaining an antlerless deer permit through the special landowner drawing but is
2288 successful in obtaining a permit through other means is not charged for that permit.
