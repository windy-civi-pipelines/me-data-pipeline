37 sale, dissemination, distribution or exhibition indicate that an image as described in
38 subsection 1 is being exploited by the defendant for the sake of its prurient appeal, this
39 evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the image and may justify the conclusion
40 that the image lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.

42 whole lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value in description or
43 representation of the image as described in subsection 1, the fact that the defendant knew
Page 3 - 132LR0110(01)

414 that the image depicts a minor under 16 years of age engaged in sexually explicit conduct,
425 as defined in section 281, subsection 4, is a factor that may be considered in making that
436 determination.

3 Section 9‑A governs the use of prior convictions when determining a sentence.
4 2. For the purposes of this section, possession of 10 100 or more copies images of any

7 disseminate.
8 3. For purposes of this section, any element of age of the person depicted means the
9 age of the person identifiable child at the time the sexually explicit conduct occurred, not

23 in description or representation of the image, the fact that the defendant knew that the image
24 depicts a minor under 16 years of age engaged in sexually explicit conduct, as defined in
25 section 281, subsection 4, is a factor that may be considered in making that determination.
26 7. This section does not apply to any noncommercial dissemination, distribution or
27 exhibition for purely educational purposes by any library, art gallery, museum, public
28 school, private school or institution of learning, nor to any commercial distribution or
29 exhibition by any art gallery or museum.

3 produced.

23 whole lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value in description or
24 representation of the image, the fact that the defendant knew that the image depicts a minor

15 SUMMARY
1166 This bill makes several changes in the Maine Criminal Code to protect children and
1177 adults from sexual abuse that is facilitated by technology, including modified images or
1188 videos of children or artificially created images of children. First, the bill defines the terms
1199 "child sexual abuse material," "identifiable child," "image," "obscene material" and
2200 "generative AI or machine learning" and amends the definition of "minor" for purposes of
2211 the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17-A, chapter 12 to ban the possession and dissemination
2222 of child sexual abuse material.
23 The bill expands the crime of sexual exploitation of a minor by specifying that a person
24 is guilty of sexual exploitation of a minor if knowing or intending that the conduct will be
25 used to create an image and, for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of
26 that person or another person, the person intentionally or knowingly employs, solicits,
27 entices, persuades or uses an identifiable child to engage in sexually explicit conduct or
28 create child sexual abuse material. The bill further expands the crime of sexual exploitation
29 of a minor to include a person who intentionally or knowingly modifies or alters an image
30 to depict child sexual abuse material and the identifiable child depicted is a minor. The bill
31 also expands that crime to prohibit a person from intentionally or knowingly manufacturing
32 or creating an image, including generative AI or machine learning, and the person knows
33 or should know that the material depicts child sexual abuse material and is obscene
34 material.
35 The bill amends the statute prohibiting possession of sexually explicit material to the
36 crime of prohibiting possession of child sexual abuse material. A person is guilty of
37 possession of child sexual abuse material if that person intentionally or knowingly
38 transports, exhibits, purchases, possesses or accesses with intent to view any child sexual
39 abuse material that the person knows or should know depicts, or has been modified to
40 depict, an identifiable child. A person is also guilty of possession of child sexual abuse
41 material if the person intentionally or knowingly transports, exhibits, purchases, possesses
42 or accesses with intent to view any child sexual abuse material, including an image created
Page 8 - 132LR0110(01)

413 using generative AI or machine learning, or material that the person knows or has reason
424 to know depicts a child engaging in sexually explicit conduct and is obscene material.
3 The bill also expands the scope of the crime of dissemination of sexually explicit
4 material to include images created using generative AI or machine learning.
5 The bill also expands the scope of the crime of unauthorized dissemination of certain
6 private images in Title 17-A, section 511-A. A person is guilty of unauthorized
7 dissemination of certain private images if the person, with the intent to harass, torment or
8 threaten the depicted person or another person, intentionally or knowingly disseminates,
9 displays or publishes an image of another person in a state of nudity or engaged in a sexual
10 act or engaged in sexual contact or creates or modifies an image to represent the depicted
11 person in a state of nudity or engaged in a sexual act or engaged in sexual contact in a
12 manner in which there is no public or newsworthy purpose.
13 Finally, the bill expands the definition of "abuse" under the protection from abuse laws
14 to allow a person to seek a protection order against another person who communicates to
15 the person a threat to commit, or cause to be committed, a crime of unauthorized
16 dissemination of certain private images.
