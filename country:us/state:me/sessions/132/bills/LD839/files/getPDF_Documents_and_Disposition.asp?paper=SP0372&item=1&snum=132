9 of net energy billing arrangements.
10 Sec. 2. 35-A MRSA §3209-A, sub-§10 is enacted to read:

20 distribution utility to provide to the commission, at least annually, an estimate of kilowatt-
21 hour credit program costs for the following year. The commission rules must establish a
22 schedule for the commission's payment of kilowatt-hour program costs and a reconciliation
23 process by which any overpayments are returned by a transmission and distribution utility
24 to the Net Energy Billing Cost Stabilization Fund. Notwithstanding any provision of this
25 section to the contrary, rules adopted by the commission pursuant to this subsection are
26 routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.

18 subchapter 2‑A.
19 Sec. 6. 35-A MRSA §3209-B, sub-§10 is enacted to read:

23 subsection 10 and commercial and institutional program costs, less monetized benefits, as
24 described in subsection 9. The commission may receive and deposit in the fund funds from
