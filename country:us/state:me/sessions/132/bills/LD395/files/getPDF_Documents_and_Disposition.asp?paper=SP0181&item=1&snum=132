8 regulation of the United States enacted before, on or after October 10, 1980 that accords a
9 special status or right to or relates to a special status or right of any Indian, Indian nation,
10 tribe or band of Indians, Indian lands, Indian reservations, Indian country, Indian territory
11 or land held in trust for Indians, except as otherwise provided in subsection 4.
12 6. Contingent repeal. Notwithstanding Title 1, section 71, subsection 8, this section

14 part of this section is effective in causing the statutes and regulations of the United States
15 that are generally applicable to or enacted for the benefit of Indians or relate to a special
16 status or right of Indian nations or tribes or bands of Indians or to lands owned by or held
17 in trust for Indians, Indian nations or tribes or bands of Indians to apply to the Houlton
18 Band of Maliseet Indians and its Indian territory or trust land. For purposes of this
19 subsection, "final judgment" does not include a judgment that is the subject of a pending
20 appeal or for which the time period for taking an appeal has not yet expired. If this
21 contingency is met, the Attorney General or the Houlton Band Council of the Houlton Band
22 of Maliseet Indians shall notify the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Senate, the Clerk
23 of the House of Representatives and the Revisor of Statutes.
24 Sec. 4. 30 MRSA c. 605 is enacted to read:
25 CHAPTER 605
26 MI'KMAQ NATION
27 ยง7301. Federal statutes and regulations
28 1. Application of statutes and regulations of the United States. Sections 6(h) and
29 16(b) of United States Public Law 96-420 provide that the laws and regulations of the
30 United States that are generally applicable to or enacted for the benefit of Indians or relate
31 to a special status or right of Indian nations or tribes or bands of Indians or to lands owned
32 by or held in trust for Indians, Indian nations or tribes or bands of Indians are applicable
33 within this State unless such law or regulation affects or preempts the civil, criminal or
34 regulatory jurisdiction of this State, including, without limitation, laws of this State relating
35 to land use or environmental matters.
36 A. This section modifies the application of the laws of this State with respect to the
37 Mi'kmaq Nation and its Indian territory or trust land to the limited extent that such
38 laws, in the absence of the provisions of this section, would be affected or preempted
39 by the application of the statutes and regulations of the United States that are generally
40 applicable to or enacted for the benefit of Indians or relate to a special status or right
41 of Indian nations or tribes or bands of Indians or to lands owned by or held in trust for
Page 9 - 132LR0212(01)

412 Indians, Indian nations or tribes or bands of Indians, except as otherwise provided by
423 this section.
3 B. This section confirms, establishes and enables, with respect to the Mi'kmaq Nation
4 and its Indian territory or trust land, the operation, application and implementation in
5 this State of the statutes and regulations of the United States that are generally
6 applicable to Indians, Indian nations or tribes or bands of Indians or to lands owned by
7 or held in trust for Indians, Indian nations or tribes or bands of Indians, including such
8 statutes and regulations enacted for the benefit of Indians, Indian nations or tribes or
9 bands of Indians and statutes and regulations that accord a special status or right to or
10 that relate to a special status or right of any Indian, Indian nation, tribe or band of
11 Indians, Indian lands, Indian reservations, Indian country, Indian territory or land or
12 other natural resources held in trust for Indians, except as otherwise provided by this
13 section.
14 C. This section does not:
15 (1) Extend the general body of federal common law known as federal Indian law
16 to the Mi'kmaq Nation and its Indian territory or trust land; or
17 (2) Adjust the jurisdictional relationship set forth in United States Public Law 102-
18 171 between this State and the Mi'kmaq Nation except as provided by this section.
19 2. Federal statutes and regulations apply. Notwithstanding any provision of this
20 section to the contrary, the State and the Mi'kmaq Nation agree and intend pursuant to
21 United States Public Law 102-171 that:
22 A. Any law of this State that would be affected or preempted by the operation,
23 application or implementation of any statute or regulation of the United States that
24 accords a special status or right to or relates to a special status or right of any Indian,
25 Indian nation, tribe or band of Indians, Indian lands, Indian reservations, Indian
26 country, Indian territory or land held in trust for Indians does not apply to the Mi'kmaq
27 Nation, except as otherwise provided in subsection 4;
28 B. Any statute or regulation of the United States enacted before, on or after October
29 10, 1980 that accords a special status or right to or relates to a special status or right of
30 any Indian, Indian nation, tribe or band of Indians, Indian lands, Indian reservations,
31 Indian country, Indian territory or land held in trust for Indians is applicable to the
32 Mi'kmaq Nation, without regard to any effect on the application of the laws of this
33 State, except as provided in subsection 4;
34 C. This modification of the application of the laws of this State to the Mi'kmaq Nation
35 under this section is limited to those particular circumstances in which the application
36 of the laws of this State to the Mi'kmaq Nation would conflict or interfere with the
37 actual operation, application or implementation of a statute or regulation of the United
38 States that accords a special status or right to or relates to a special status or right of
39 any Indian, Indian nation, tribe or band of Indians, Indian lands, Indian reservations,
40 Indian country, Indian territory or land held in trust for Indians; and
41 D. If the operation, application or implementation of any statute or regulation of the
42 United States to the Mi'kmaq Nation would result in the absence of any law or
43 regulation applicable to the Mi'kmaq Nation relating to a matter of public health or
44 safety, including without limitation laws relating to land use or environmental matters,
Page 10 - 132LR0212(01)

415 the corresponding laws of the State with respect to that health or safety matter must
426 apply to the Mi'kmaq Nation to fill any regulatory gap. For the purposes of this
437 paragraph, "corresponding laws of the State" means laws of the State that apply to
448 similar activities outside of Indian lands, Indian reservations, Indian country, Indian
459 territory or land held in trust for Indians.
6 3. Notice regarding applicability of federal and state law. Whenever the Mi'kmaq
7 Nation believes that a law of this State does not apply to the Mi'kmaq Nation, its citizens
8 or its tribal territory or trust land as a result of subsection 2 and the application of a statute
9 or regulation of the United States, the Mi'kmaq Nation shall provide written notice to the
10 Attorney General. The Attorney General shall use reasonable efforts to respond in writing
11 to the Mi'kmaq Nation within 30 days if the State disagrees with the Mi'kmaq Nation's
12 position regarding the application of the laws of this State. The failure of the Mi'kmaq
13 Nation to provide notice under this subsection does not limit the application to the Mi'kmaq
14 Nation of any statute or regulation of the United States. The failure of the Attorney General
15 to provide notice under this subsection does not limit the authority of the State to dispute
16 the application of any statute or regulation of the United States or the application of any
17 law of this State.
18 4. Gaming activities; criminal jurisdiction; environmental laws. Notwithstanding
19 any provision of this section to the contrary:
20 A. The Mi'kmaq Nation may conduct gaming activities only in accordance with the
21 laws of this State and may not conduct gaming activities under the authority of the
22 federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act or under any regulations promulgated under the
23 federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act by the chair of the National Indian Gaming
24 Commission or its successor organization;
25 B. The laws of this State applicable to crimes and juvenile crimes apply to the Mi'kmaq
26 Nation. The statutes and regulations of the United States that conflict with or affect or
27 preempt the jurisdiction of this State over crimes and juvenile crimes do not apply to
28 the Mi'kmaq Nation, unless such provisions are specifically made applicable within the
29 State of Maine. The federal laws identified in Section 6(c) of United States Public Law
30 96-420 do not apply in this State; and
31 C. The provisions of the federal Clean Water Act, the federal Water Quality Act of
32 1987, the federal Clean Air Act and the federal Indian Mineral Development Act of
33 1982, including all future amendments and reauthorizations of those Acts, do not apply
34 with respect to the Mi'kmaq Nation and its Indian territory or trust land to the extent
35 the provisions affect or preempt the application of the laws of this State and directly or
36 indirectly extend the jurisdiction of the Mi'kmaq Nation beyond its Indian territory or
37 trust land, unless such provisions are specifically made applicable within the State of
38 Maine.
39 5. Powers of Mi'kmaq Nation relating to federal statutes and regulations.
40 Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the State and the Mi'kmaq Nation
41 agree and intend pursuant to United States Public Law 102-171 that the Mi'kmaq Nation
42 has the power to enact laws and ordinances relating to the operation, application and
43 implementation of any statute or regulation of the United States enacted before, on or after
44 October 10, 1980 that accords a special status or right to or relates to a special status or
45 right of any Indian, Indian nation, tribe or band of Indians, Indian lands, Indian
Page 11 - 132LR0212(01)

416 reservations, Indian country, Indian territory or land held in trust for Indians, except as
427 otherwise provided in subsection 4.
3 6. Contingent repeal. Notwithstanding Title 1, section 71, subsection 8, this section
4 is repealed if a court of competent jurisdiction enters a final judgment concluding that no
5 part of this section is effective in causing the statutes and regulations of the United States
6 that are generally applicable to or enacted for the benefit of Indians or relate to a special
7 status or right of Indian nations or tribes or bands of Indians or to lands owned by or held
8 in trust for Indians, Indian nations or tribes or bands of Indians to apply to the Mi'kmaq
9 Nation and its Indian territory or trust land. For purposes of this subsection, "final
10 judgment" does not include a judgment that is the subject of a pending appeal or for which
11 the time period for taking an appeal has not yet expired. If this contingency is met, the
12 Attorney General or the Mi'kmaq Nation Tribal Council shall notify the Secretary of State,
13 the Secretary of the Senate, the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Revisor of
14 Statutes.
15 Sec. 5. Contingent effective date. That section of this Act that enacts the Maine
16 Revised Statutes, Title 30, section 6215 takes effect 120 days after adjournment of the First
17 Regular Session of the 132nd Legislature only if, within 90 days after adjournment of the
18 First Regular Session of the 132nd Legislature, the Secretary of State receives written
19 certification from the Joint Tribal Council of the Passamaquoddy Tribe that the tribe has
20 agreed to the provisions of that section, copies of which must be submitted by the Secretary
21 of State to the Secretary of the Senate, the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the
22 Revisor of Statutes.
23 That section of this Act that enacts the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 30, section 6216
24 takes effect 120 days after adjournment of the First Regular Session of the 132nd
25 Legislature only if, within 90 days after adjournment of the First Regular Session of the
26 132nd Legislature, the Secretary of State receives written certification from the Governor
27 and the Council of the Penobscot Nation that the nation has agreed to the provisions of that
28 section, copies of which must be submitted by the Secretary of State to the Secretary of the
29 Senate, the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Revisor of Statutes.
30 That section of this Act that enacts the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 30, section 6217
31 takes effect 120 days after adjournment of the First Regular Session of the 132nd
32 Legislature only if, within 90 days after adjournment of the First Regular Session of the
33 132nd Legislature, the Secretary of State receives written certification from the Houlton
34 Band Council of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians that the band has agreed to the
35 provisions of that section, copies of which must be submitted by the Secretary of State to
36 the Secretary of the Senate, the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Revisor of
37 Statutes. Upon such written certification by the Houlton Band Council of the Houlton Band
38 of Maliseet Indians, Title 30, section 6217 constitutes a jurisdictional agreement for
39 purposes of the federal Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980, United States Public
40 Law 96-420, Section 6(e)(2). Such written certification by the Houlton Band Council of
41 the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians does not constitute an agreement that the
42 contingencies in Public Law 1981, chapter 675 were met or that the provisions of Public
43 Law 1981, chapter 675 ever took effect.
44 That section of this Act that enacts the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 30, chapter 605
45 takes effect 120 days after adjournment of the First Regular Session of the 132nd
Page 12 - 132LR0212(01)

416 Legislature only if, within 90 days after adjournment of the First Regular Session of the
427 132nd Legislature, the Secretary of State receives written certification from the Mi'kmaq
438 Nation Tribal Council that the nation has agreed to the provisions of that chapter, copies of
449 which must be submitted by the Secretary of State to the Secretary of the Senate, the Clerk
550 of the House of Representatives and the Revisor of Statutes. Upon such written
561 certification by the Mi'kmaq Nation Tribal Council, Title 30, chapter 605 constitutes a
572 jurisdictional agreement for purposes of the Aroostook Band of Micmacs Settlement Act,
583 United States Public Law 102-171, Section 6(d). Such written certification by the Mi'kmaq
594 Nation Tribal Council does not constitute an agreement that the contingencies in Public
1505 Law 1989, chapter 148 were met or that the provisions of Public Law 1989, chapter 148
1516 ever took effect.
12 SUMMARY
1133 This bill:
14 1. Establishes new findings within the Maine Implementing Act to distinguish
15 legislative findings relevant to this bill from the findings made during the enactment of the
16 original 1980 Implementing Act. Separate but identical findings are included for the
17 Passamaquoddy Tribe, Penobscot Nation and Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians. These
18 findings describe the effect of Section 6(h) and Section 16(b) of the federal Settlement Act,
19 United States Public Law 96-420, in precluding the Passamaquoddy Tribe, Penobscot
20 Nation and Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians from benefiting from federal laws and
21 regulations that are generally applicable to or enacted for the benefit of Indians or relate to
22 a special status or right of Indian nations or tribes or bands of Indians or to lands owned by
23 or held in trust for Indians, Indian nations or tribes or bands of Indians if such law or
24 regulation affects or preempts the civil, criminal or regulatory jurisdiction of this State,
25 including, without limitation, laws of this State relating to land use or environmental
26 matters. The findings describe the purposes of the amendments to the Maine Implementing
27 Act included in this legislation regarding the application of state and federal law to the
28 Passamaquoddy Tribe, Penobscot Nation and Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians;
29 2. Adds separate but identical sections to the Maine Implementing Act that apply to
30 the Passamaquoddy Tribe, Penobscot Nation and Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and
31 that describe the application of federal and state law to each. Regarding state law, the
32 language provides that any law of this State that would be affected or preempted by the
33 operation, application or implementation of any statute or regulation of the United States
34 that accords a special status or right to or relates to a special status or right of any Indian,
35 Indian nation, tribe or band of Indians, Indian lands, Indian reservations, Indian country,
36 Indian territory or land held in trust for Indians does not apply, except as specifically
37 provided in the Act;
38 3. Regarding federal law, provides that any statute or regulation of the United States
39 enacted before, on or after October 10, 1980 that accords a special status or right to or
40 relates to a special status or right of any Indian, Indian nation, tribe or band of Indians,
41 Indian lands, Indian reservations, Indian country, Indian territory or land held in trust for
42 Indians is applicable within this State, without regard to any effect on the application of the
43 laws of this State, except as specifically provided;
44 4. Provides that modification of the application of the laws of this State is limited to
45 those particular circumstances in which the application of the laws of this State would
Page 13 - 132LR0212(01)

416 conflict or interfere with the actual operation, application or implementation of a statute or
427 regulation of the United States that accords a special status or right to or relates to a special
438 status or right of any Indian, Indian nation, tribe or band of Indians, Indian lands, Indian
449 reservations, Indian country, Indian territory or land held in trust for Indians. If the
550 operation, application or implementation of any statute or regulation of the United States
561 in this State would result in the absence of any law or regulation applicable to a matter of
572 public health or safety, including without limitation laws relating to land use or
583 environmental matters, the corresponding laws of the State with respect to that health or
594 safety matter apply to fill any regulatory gap;
10 5. Describes a process by which the Passamaquoddy Tribe, Penobscot Nation and
11 Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians are to notify the Attorney General in the event they
12 believe that a law of this State does not apply by virtue of the amendments proposed by
13 this legislation;
14 6. Provides that the Passamaquoddy Tribe, Penobscot Nation and Houlton Band of
15 Maliseet Indians may conduct gaming activities only in accordance with the laws of this
16 State and may not conduct gaming activities under the authority of the federal Indian
17 Gaming Regulatory Act or under any regulations promulgated under the federal Indian
18 Gaming Regulatory Act by the chair of the National Indian Gaming Commission or its
19 successor organization;
20 7. Provides that the laws of this State applicable to the crimes and juvenile crimes
21 described in this legislation apply to the Passamaquoddy Tribe, Penobscot Nation and
22 Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians as provided in this legislation; the statutes and
23 regulations of the United States that conflict with or affect or preempt the jurisdiction of
24 this State over crimes and juvenile crimes described in this legislation do not apply in this
25 State; and the federal laws identified in Section 6(c) of United States Public Law 96-420
26 do not apply in this State;
27 8. Provides that the federal Clean Water Act, the federal Water Quality Act of 1987,
28 the federal Clean Air Act and the federal Indian Mineral Development Act of 1982, as well
29 as all future amendments to those laws, do not apply to the Passamaquoddy Tribe,
30 Penobscot Nation, Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and Mi'kmaq Nation and their Indian
31 territory or trust land to the extent the provisions affect or preempt the application of the
32 laws of this State and extend the jurisdiction of the tribe, nation or band beyond their Indian
33 territory or trust land, unless such provisions are specifically made applicable within the
34 State;
35 9. Provides that, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the State, the
36 Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians
37 agree and intend that each tribe, nation or band has the power to enact laws and ordinances
38 relating to the operation, application and implementation of any statute or regulation of the
39 United States enacted before, on or after October 10, 1980 that accords a special status or
40 right to or relates to a special status or right of any Indian, Indian nation, tribe or band of
41 Indians, Indian lands, Indian reservations, Indian country, Indian territory or land held in
42 trust for Indians, except as otherwise provided;
43 10. Creates a new chapter within the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 30 pertaining to
44 the Mi'kmaq Nation with provisions that mirror those applicable to the Passamaquoddy
45 Tribe, Penobscot Nation and Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians;
Page 14 - 132LR0212(01)

1 11. Adds contingent effective date language specific to each tribe, nation or band; and
2 12. Adds contingent repeal language.
