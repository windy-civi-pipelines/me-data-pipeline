30 SUMMARY
3311 This amendment amends the provisions of the bill requiring the Maine Commission on
3322 Public Defense Services to compensate a private attorney appointed by the court to
3333 represent a person who is eligible to receive indigent legal services if the court finds that
3344 no public defender, assigned counsel, contract counsel or employed counsel is available to
3355 represent the person. The amendment:
36 1. Changes from July 1, 2027 to February 1, 2026 the date that this requirement
37 expires;
38 2. Requires that a private attorney appointed by a trial court have at least 3 years of
39 relevant legal experience and that a private attorney appointed by the Supreme Judicial
40 Court either have 3 years of relevant legal experience or have previously served as a law
41 clerk analyzing cases relevant to the pending matter;
Page 4 - 132LR1299(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to S.P. 462, L.D. 1101
1 3. Requires that the private attorney use the voucher review and payment authorization
2 systems established by the commission and be subject to limited supervision by the
3 commission;
4 4. Provides that personal contact information of a private attorney appointed by a court
5 is confidential to the same extent as personal contact information of a commission-rostered
6 attorney and authorizes the judicial branch to share otherwise confidential information
7 regarding cases in which private attorneys have been appointed by the court to the same
8 extent that the judicial branch may share the same type of information regarding cases in
9 which assigned counsel are providing indigent legal services; and
10 5. Eliminates any reference to any inherent authority of the court to appoint counsel.
11 The amendment also removes the appropriation in the bill that establishes an Office
12 Associate II position to coordinate and facilitate the assignment of counsel to indigent
13 clients across the State who are currently on the list of unrepresented criminal defendants
14 and parents, especially defendants who are incarcerated. Instead, the amendment provides
15 that the new Assistant Defender I positions established by this legislation will be supported
16 by a Legal Administrator, rather than an Office Specialist Supervisor II, who can provide
17 both administrative support to the Assistant Defender I positions and coordinate and
18 facilitate the assignment of counsel to indigent clients across the State who are currently
19 on the list of unrepresented criminal defendants and parents, especially defendants who are
20 incarcerated.
21 The amendment further clarifies that the new Assistant Defender I and Paralegal
22 positions established by this legislation are primarily responsible for providing indigent
23 legal services to criminal defendants and parties in child protective proceedings for whom
24 another public defender, assigned counsel, contract counsel or employed counsel is not
25 available to represent the defendant or party and, to the extent there is additional capacity,
26 these positions may also represent other individuals who are eligible for indigent legal
27 services but for whom another public defender, assigned counsel, contract counsel or
28 employed counsel is not available to represent the person.
29 Finally, the amendment requires the commission and the judicial branch to submit
30 reports to the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary by January 1, 2026, with an update
31 on the status of the Robbins v. Billings, et al., No. CV-22-054 litigation, including
32 information on any defendants who have been granted habeas corpus relief by the court
33 and with specific information about the implementation of the provisions of this legislation.
34 The committee may report out legislation in response to these reports to the Second Regular
35 Session of the 132nd Legislature.
