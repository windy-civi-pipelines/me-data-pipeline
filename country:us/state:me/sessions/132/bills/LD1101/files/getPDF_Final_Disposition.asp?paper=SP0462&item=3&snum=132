An Act to Address the Limited Availability of Counsel in Courts to Represent
Indigent Parties in Matters Affecting Their Fundamental Rights
Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, this legislation is designed to address an existing crisis in the courts arising
from the limited availability of counsel qualified by the Maine Commission on Public
Defense Services to represent indigent parties in criminal and child protection proceedings
affecting their fundamental rights; and
Whereas, when a court appoints counsel to represent an indigent party, compensation
must be made available to counsel, whether the commission or the court determined that
counsel is qualified to provide the representation; and
Whereas, a Maine Superior Court order issued in Robbins v. Billings, et al., No. CV-
22-054 (Me. Super. Ct., Ken. Cty., March 7, 2025) (Order After Phase One Trial)
establishes a conditional remedy to address claims for habeas corpus relief for violations
of the United States Constitution, Amendment VI and the Constitution of Maine, Article I,
Section 6 right to continuous representation; and
Whereas, the resources necessary to implement the conditional remedy are currently
under consideration by the Legislature and requested by the Maine Commission on Public
Defense Services; and
Whereas, the conditional remedy poses a concern about the public's interest in the
administration of criminal justice and the potential to jeopardize public safety if a criminal
defendant commits a dangerous act after dismissal and release granted in response to a
claim for habeas corpus relief; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore,
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
