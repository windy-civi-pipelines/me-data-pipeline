1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, this legislation is designed to address an existing crisis in the courts arising
4 from the limited availability of counsel qualified by the Maine Commission on Public
5 Defense Services to represent indigent parties in matters affecting their fundamental rights;
6 and
7 Whereas, when a court appoints counsel to represent an indigent party, compensation
8 must be made available to counsel, whether the commission or the court determined that
9 counsel is qualified to provide the representation; and
10 Whereas, a Maine Superior Court order issued in Robbins v. Billings, et al., No. CV-
11 22-054 (Me. Super. Ct., Ken. Cty., March 7, 2025) (Order After Phase One Trial)
12 establishes a conditional remedy to address claims for habeas corpus relief for violations
13 of the United States Constitution, Amendment VI and the Constitution of Maine, Article I,
14 Section 6 right to continuous representation; and
15 Whereas, the resources necessary to implement the conditional remedy are currently
16 under consideration by the Legislature and requested by the Maine Commission on Public
17 Defense Services; and
18 Whereas, the conditional remedy poses a concern about the public's interest in the
19 administration of criminal justice and the potential to jeopardize public safety if a criminal
20 defendant commits a dangerous act after dismissal and release granted in response to a
21 claim for habeas corpus relief; and
22 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
23 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
24 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
25 therefore,
26 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
27 Sec. 1. 4 MRSA §1805-A, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 284, Pt. UUUU, §14,

14 shall order the defendant or civil party to make installment payments up to the full cost
15 of representation or to pay a fixed contribution. The court shall remit payments
16 received to the commission.
17 B. A defendant or civil party may not be required to pay for legal services in an amount
