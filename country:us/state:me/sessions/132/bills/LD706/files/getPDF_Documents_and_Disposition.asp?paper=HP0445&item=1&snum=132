4 §1192-A. Eligibility conditions
5 The following provisions govern an individual's eligibility to receive benefits under

7 1. Definitions. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the
8 following terms have the following meanings.

10 B. "Educational service agency" means a governmental agency or governmental entity
11 that is established and operated exclusively for the purpose of providing services to one
12 or more educational institutions.
13 C. "Good cause" means:
14 (1) The unemployed individual is ill;
15 (2) The presence of the unemployed individual is required due to an illness of the

26 emergencies and transportation emergencies.

28 misdemeanor.
29 D. "Suitable employment" means, with respect to an individual, work of a substantially
30 equal or higher skill level than the individual's past adversely affected employment, as

34 E. "Union hiring hall" means a service provided by a labor union or an entity associated
35 with a labor union that places employees with an employer under a collective
36 bargaining agreement or otherwise places employees with employers.
37 2. Eligibility. An unemployed individual is eligible to receive benefits with respect to
38 any week only if:
39 A. The individual has made a claim for benefits with respect to the week or part thereof
40 in accordance with rules adopted by the commissioner;
Page 5 - 132LR0140(01)

1 B. The individual has registered for work at and continued to report at an employment
2 office in accordance with rules the commissioner adopts, except that the commissioner
3 may, by rule, waive or alter either or both of the requirements of this paragraph as to
4 individuals attached to regular jobs and as to such other types of cases or situations
5 with respect to which the commissioner finds that compliance with the requirements
6 would be oppressive or would be inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter. A rule
7 under this paragraph may not conflict with section 1191, subsection 1;
8 C. For each week in which a claim for benefits is filed, the individual is actively
9 seeking work, unless the individual is participating in approved training under
10 subsection 3 or the work search requirement has been waived in accordance with rules
11 adopted by the commissioner, and the individual provides evidence of work search
12 efforts in a manner and form as prescribed by the Department of Labor. Failure to
13 provide required work search documentation results in a denial of benefits in
14 accordance with section 1194, subsection 2 for the week or weeks for which
15 documentation was not provided unless the department determines there is good cause
16 for the individual's failure to comply with this requirement.
17 Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary, an individual is
18 considered to be actively seeking work in accordance with this section if the individual
19 is a member of a bona fide labor union, maintains contact with that union and uses and
20 complies with the placement services of the union hiring hall in seeking work;
21 D. The individual is able to work and is available for work at the individual's usual or
22 customary hours, commute, trade, occupation, profession or business or in such other
23 trade, occupation, profession or business for which the individual's prior training or
24 experience shows the individual to be fitted or qualified, and in addition to having
25 complied with paragraphs B and C, is actively seeking work in accordance with the
26 rules of the commissioner.
27 Ineligibility may not be determined solely because an individual is unable to accept
28 employment on a shift, the greater part of which falls between the hours of midnight to
29 5 a.m., and is unavailable for that employment because of parental obligation, the need
30 to care for an immediate family member or the unavailability of a personal care
31 attendant required to assist the unemployed individual who is a person with a disability.
32 An unemployed individual who is neither able nor available for work due to good cause
33 as determined by the deputy is eligible to receive prorated benefits for that portion of
34 the week during which the individual was able and is available.
35 Notwithstanding this paragraph, an individual who worked full-time for the majority
36 of the weeks during that individual's base period but is able and available for and
37 actively seeking only part-time work because of the illness or disability of the
38 individual or an immediate family member, or because of limitations necessary for the
39 safety or protection of the individual or the individual's immediate family member,
40 may not be disqualified from receiving benefits. The individual's benefits must be
41 prorated in accordance with the individual's current availability;
42 E. The individual has served a waiting period of one week of total or partial
43 unemployment. A week may not be counted as a week of total or partial unemployment
44 for the purpose of this paragraph:
45 (1) If benefits have been paid with respect to that week;
Page 6 - 132LR0140(01)

1 (2) Unless it occurs within the benefit year that includes the week with respect to
2 which the individual claims payment of benefits; and
3 (3) Unless the individual was eligible for benefits with respect to that week, as
4 provided in this section and section 1193, except for the requirements of this
5 paragraph; and
6 F. For an individual establishing a benefit year on or after January 1, 1980, the
7 individual has been paid wages equal to or exceeding 2 times the annual average
8 weekly wage for insured work in each of 2 different quarters in the individual's base
9 period and has been paid total wages equal to or exceeding 6 times the annual average
10 weekly wage in the individual's base period for insured work.
11 For the purposes of this paragraph, the annual average weekly wage amount to be used
12 is that which is applicable at the time the individual files a request for determination of
13 insured status.
14 For the purposes of this paragraph, wages are counted as "wages for insured work" for
15 benefit purposes with respect to a benefit year only if the benefit year begins
16 subsequent to the date on which the employer by whom such wages were paid has
17 satisfied the conditions of section 1043, subsection 9, or section 1222, subsection 3,
18 with respect to becoming an employer; except that an individual may not receive
19 benefits in a benefit year unless, subsequent to the beginning of the next preceding
20 benefit year during which that individual received benefits, that individual performed
21 services and earned remuneration for such services in an amount equal to or greater
22 than 8 times that individual's weekly benefit amount in employment by an employer in
23 the benefit year being established.
24 This paragraph applies only to an individual requesting determination of insured status
25 on and after January 1, 1972. In determining an individual's qualification under this
26 subsection, payments pursuant to former Title 39, sections 54, 55, 188 and 189 and
27 Title 39-A, sections 608 and 609 are considered wages for insured work.
28 3. Approved training. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary,
29 an otherwise eligible individual who is in training, as approved for the individual by the
30 deputy, under rules adopted by the commissioner, may not be denied benefits for any week
31 with respect to subsection 2, paragraphs C and D relating to availability and the work search
32 requirement or section 1193, subsection 3. Enrollment in a degree-granting program may
33 not be the sole cause for denial of approved training status for an otherwise eligible
34 individual. Benefits paid to any eligible individual while in approved training for which
35 except for this subsection the individual could be disqualified under section 1193,
36 subsection 3 may not be charged against the experience rating record of an employer but
37 must be charged to the General Fund.
38 Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, the following provisions
39 further govern an individual's eligibility for benefits with respect to training:
40 A. Any otherwise eligible individual may not be denied benefits for any week because
41 the individual is in training approved under 19 United States Code, Section 2296(a) or
42 under any amendment or addition to the United States Trade Act of 1974. That
43 individual may not be denied benefits:
Page 7 - 132LR0140(01)

1 (1) For leaving work to enter that training, as long as the work left is not suitable
2 employment; or
3 (2) Because of the application to any such week in training of provisions in this
4 chapter or any applicable federal unemployment compensation law relating to
5 availability for work, active search for work or refusal to accept work.
6 Benefits paid to an eligible individual while in training for which, except for this
7 paragraph, the individual could be disqualified under section 1193, subsection 1 or 3
8 may not be charged against the experience rating record of an employer but must be
9 charged to the General Fund;
10 B. The acceptance of training for opportunities available through United States Public
11 Law 97-300 is considered to be acceptance of training with the approval of the State
12 within the meaning of any other provisions of federal or state law relating to
13 unemployment benefits;
14 C. The acceptance of training for opportunities available under sections 2031 and 2033
15 is considered to be acceptance of training with state approval under federal or state law
16 relating to unemployment benefits as long as the training is in accordance with rules
17 adopted by the commissioner; and
18 D. Unless inconsistent with federal law, the acceptance of training opportunities
19 available through the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, 29 United
20 States Code, Sections 3101 to 3361 is considered to be acceptance of training with the
21 approval of the State within the meaning of any other provision of federal or state law
22 relating to unemployment benefits as long as the training is in accordance with rules
23 the commissioner adopts.
24 4. Service with nonprofit organizations and educational institutions and state and
25 local governments. Benefits based on service in employment, as defined in section 1043,
26 subsection 11, paragraph A-1, subparagraphs (1) and (3), are payable in the same amount,
27 on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as benefits payable on the basis of
28 other services subject to this chapter, except that:
29 A. With respect to weeks of unemployment beginning after December 31, 1977, for
30 services in an instructional, research or principal administrative capacity for an
31 educational institution, if there is a contract or annual written reasonable assurance that

33 a 2nd academic year or term, benefits may not be paid to an individual based on those
34 services for any week of unemployment:
35 (1) Commencing during the period between 2 successive academic years or terms;
36 (2) During a period, similar to the period described in subparagraph 1, between 2
37 regular, but not successive, terms when provided for by an agreement; or
38 (3) During a period of paid sabbatical leave provided for in an individual's contract,
39 if that individual performs services in a first academic year or term;
40 B. With respect to weeks of unemployment beginning after September 3, 1982, for
41 services for an educational institution in any capacity other than an instructional,
42 research or principal administrative capacity, benefits may not be paid on the basis of
43 those services to an individual for any week that commences during a period between
Page 8 - 132LR0140(01)

414 2 successive academic years or terms if the individual performs those services in the
425 first of those academic years or terms and there is annual written reasonable assurance
436 that the individual will perform the services in the 2nd of those academic years or
447 terms; except that if benefits are denied to an individual under this paragraph and the
458 individual was not offered an opportunity to perform the services for the educational
469 institution for the 2nd of those academic years or terms, the individual is entitled to a
570 retroactive payment of benefits for each week for which the individual filed a timely
581 claim for benefits and for which benefits were denied solely by reason of this
592 paragraph;
10 C. With respect to weeks of unemployment beginning after December 31, 1977,

9 States as a result of temporary parole pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act,
10 8 United States Code, Section 1182(d)(5).
11 Any data or information required of individuals applying for benefits to determine whether
12 benefits are not payable to them because of their alien status must be uniformly required
13 from all applicants for benefits. In the case of an individual whose application for benefits
14 would otherwise be approved, a determination that benefits to the individual are not payable
15 because of the individual's alien status may not be made except upon a preponderance of
16 the evidence.
17 9. Participation in reemployment services. An individual who has been referred to
18 reemployment services pursuant to a profiling system established by the commissioner
19 must participate in those services or similar services unless it is determined that the
20 individual has completed those services or there is good cause for the individual's failure
21 to participate.
22 10. Reemployment services and eligibility assessment; participation. In the case
23 that an individual has been referred to reemployment services and eligibility assessment by
24 the Department of Labor, the individual must participate in those services, unless the
25 department determines there is good cause for the individual's failure to participate. Failure
26 to participate in reemployment services and eligibility assessment without good cause
27 results in a denial of benefits until the individual participates.
28 11. Temporary layoff; work search. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter
29 to the contrary, an otherwise eligible individual who is temporarily laid off by an employer
30 that has given that individual a definite recall date may not be denied benefits for any week
31 that is within 6 weeks of the definite recall date based on the individual's failure to meet
32 the requirements of subsection 1, paragraph B, C or D for the period of up to 6 weeks during
33 that temporary layoff, as long as the individual remains able and available to work for that
34 employer.
35 An individual may not receive more than 6 weeks of benefits in a benefit year pursuant to
36 this subsection unless approved by the Department of Labor.
37 Sec. 13. 26 MRSA §1193, sub-§6, as amended by PL 2013, c. 314, §2, is repealed
38 and the following enacted in its place:
39 6. Falsification. For any week for which the deputy finds that the individual made a
40 false statement or representation knowing it to be false or knowingly failed to disclose a
41 material fact in the individual's application or solicited another person to make a false
42 statement knowing it to be false or fail to disclose a material fact to obtain benefits from
43 any state or federal unemployment compensation program administered by the bureau. In
44 addition, for a first or 2nd occurrence, the individual is ineligible to receive any benefits
Page 10 - 132LR0140(01)

415 for a period of not less than 6 months and not more than one year from the mailing date of
426 the determination, and the commissioner shall assess a penalty of 50% of the benefits
437 falsely obtained for the first occurrence and 75% for the 2nd occurrence. If an individual
448 is disqualified for a 3rd occurrence of statement falsification or misrepresentation in an
459 effort to obtain benefits, the commissioner shall assess a penalty of 100% of the benefits
560 falsely obtained and the individual is disqualified from receiving benefits for a period of
571 time to be determined by the commissioner. The progression of penalties for multiple
582 occurrences described in this subsection does not apply and an occurrence of fraud must
593 be treated as a 3rd occurrence if:
10 A. A claim for benefits is the result of fraudulent filing using illegally obtained identity
11 information. Such claims may be canceled immediately by the bureau upon
12 confirmation of the fraudulent filing; or
13 B. An individual is found to have filed a claim to obtain benefits from any state or
14 federal unemployment compensation program administered by the bureau in the name
15 of another person using illegally obtained identity information.
16 An amount equal to 15% of each overpayment on which the penalties under this subsection
17 were assessed must be transferred directly into the fund account upon recovery;
18 Sec. 14. 26 MRSA §1194, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2023, c. 53, §§3 and 4, is
19 further amended to read:
20 2. Determination. A representative designated by the commissioner, and in this
21 chapter referred to as a deputy, shall promptly examine the first claim filed by a claimant
22 in each benefit year and shall determine the weekly benefit amount and maximum benefit
23 amount potentially payable to the claimant during that benefit year in accordance with
24 section 1192, subsection 5 1192-A, subsection 2, paragraph F.
25 The deputy shall promptly examine all subsequent claims filed and, on the basis of facts,
26 shall determine whether or not that claim is valid with respect to sections 1192 1192-A and
27 1193, other than section 1192, subsection 5 1192-A, subsection 2, paragraph F, or shall
28 refer that claim or any question involved in the claim to the Division of Administrative
29 Hearings or to the commission, which shall make a determination with respect to the claim
30 in accordance with the procedure described in subsection 3, except that in any case in which
31 the payment or denial of benefits is subject to section 1193, subsection 4, the deputy shall
32 promptly transmit a report with respect to that subsection to the Director of Unemployment
33 Compensation upon the basis of which the director shall notify appropriate deputies as to
34 the applicability of that subsection.
35 The deputy shall determine in accordance with section 1221, subsection 3, paragraph A,
36 the proper employer's experience rating record, if any, against which benefits of an eligible
37 individual must be charged, if and when paid.
38 The deputy shall promptly notify the claimant and any other interested party of the
39 determinations and reasons for the determinations. Subject to subsection 11, unless the
40 claimant or any such interested party, within 30 calendar days after that notification was
41 mailed to the claimant's last known last-known address, files an appeal from that
42 determination, that determination is final, except that the period within which an appeal
43 may be filed may be extended, for a period not to exceed an additional 30 calendar days,
44 for good cause shown. If new evidence or pertinent facts that would alter that determination
Page 11 - 132LR0140(01)

415 become known to the deputy prior to the date that determination becomes final, a
426 redetermination is authorized, but that redetermination must be mailed before the original
437 determination becomes final.
4 If an employer's separation report for an employee is not received by the office specified
5 on the separation report within 10 days after that report was requested, the claim must be
6 adjudicated on the basis of information at hand. If the employer's separation report
7 containing possible disqualifying information is received after the 10-day period and the
8 claimant is denied benefits by a revised deputy's decision, benefits paid prior to the date of
9 the revised decision do not constitute an overpayment of benefits. Any benefits paid after
10 the date of the revised decision constitute an overpayment.
11 If an employer files an amended separation report or otherwise raises a new issue as to the
12 employee's eligibility or changes the wages or weeks used in determining benefits that
13 results in a denial of benefits or a reduction of the weekly benefit amount, the benefits paid
14 prior to the date the determination is mailed do not constitute an overpayment. Any benefits
15 received after that date to which the claimant is not entitled pursuant to a new determination
16 based on that new employer information constitute an overpayment.
17 If, during the period a claimant is receiving benefits, new information or a new issue arises
18 concerning the claimant's eligibility for benefits or which affects the claimant's weekly
19 benefit amount, benefits may not be withheld until a determination is made on the issue.
20 Before a determination is made, written notice must be mailed to the claimant and other
21 interested parties, which must include the issue to be decided, the law upon which it is
22 based, any factual allegations known to the bureau, the right to a fact-finding interview, the
23 date and location of the scheduled interview and the conduct of the interview and appeal.
24 Any fact-finding interview must be scheduled not less than 7 calendar days nor more than
25 14 calendar days after the notice is mailed. The bureau shall include in the notice a
26 statement notifying the claimant that any benefits paid prior to the determination may be
27 an overpayment under applicable law and recoverable by the bureau if it is later determined
28 that the claimant was not entitled to the benefits. If the claimant does not appear for the
29 scheduled interview, the deputy shall make a determination on the basis of available
30 evidence. The deputy shall make a prompt determination of the issue based solely on any
31 written statements of interested parties filed with the bureau before the interview, together
32 with the evidence presented by interested parties who personally participated in the
33 interview by telephone or e-mail or other electronic means. Upon request and notice to all
34 parties at the interview, the deputy may accept corroborative documentary evidence after
35 the interview. In no other case may the deputy base a decision on evidence received after
36 the interview has been held.
37 A. This subsection does not apply when the claimant reports that, in the week claimed:
38 (1) The claimant worked and reports a specific amount of earnings for that work;
39 (2) The claimant worked and had earnings from that work, but does not furnish
40 the amount of earnings;
41 (3) The claimant reports that the claimant was not able or available for work for a
42 specific portion of the week and there is sufficient information for the deputy to
43 determine that the inability or unavailability for work was for good cause. If the
44 information provided by the claimant indicated unavailability during the claim
45 week, but is not specific as to the amount of time involved, the department
Page 12 - 132LR0140(01)

416 Department of Labor shall immediately initiate a fact-finding interview with the
427 individual and make a determination regarding the claimant's weekly benefit
438 amount on the basis of that interview. If the department is not able to conduct an
449 immediate fact-finding interview with the claimant, the notification and fact-
550 finding process described in this subsection must be followed; or
6 (4) The claimant received a specific amount of other remuneration as described in
7 section 1193, subsection 5.;
8 (5) The claimant reported that the claimant did not complete a work search activity
9 for that week, and that week was not under a work search waiver approved by the
10 bureau;
11 (6) The claimant failed to respond to or failed to provide sufficient documentation
12 to satisfy a written request for documentation to verify the claimant's identity as
13 listed on an initial claim within the timeframe specified by the bureau; or
14 (7) The claimant's total or partial unemployment is due to a stoppage of work as
15 described in section 1193, subsection 4.
16 Sec. 15. 26 MRSA §1194, sub-§10, as amended by PL 1987, c. 641, §12, is further
17 amended by amending the first blocked paragraph to read:
18 The deputy may reconsider a benefit payment for any particular week or weeks whenever
19 an error has occurred, but no such redetermination may be made after one year from the
20 date of payment for that week or weeks. Notice of any such redetermination shall must be
21 promptly given to the claimant. Subject to subsection 11, unless the claimant files an
22 appeal from that redetermination within 15 30 calendar days after that redetermination was
23 mailed to the claimant's last known last-known address, the redetermination shall be is
24 final, provided except that the period within which an appeal may be filed may be extended
25 for a period not to exceed an additional 15 30 calendar days for good cause shown.
26 Sec. 16. 26 MRSA §1195, sub-§1, ¶A, as corrected by RR 2023, c. 2, Pt. E, §95,
27 is amended by amending subparagraph (2) to read:
28 (2) The individual's benefit year having expired prior to that week, has no or
29 insufficient wages or employment, or both, to establish a new benefit year or,
30 subsequent to December 31, 1971, the individual does not qualify by having
31 sufficient wages or employment, or both, as provided by section 1192, subsection
32 5 1192-A, subsection 2, paragraph F, since the beginning of the individual's prior
33 benefit year; and
34 Sec. 17. 26 MRSA §1196, as corrected by RR 2023, c. 2, Pt. E, §106, is amended
35 to read:
36 §1196. Extended benefits for dislocated workers in approved training; sunset and
37 review annual report
38 1. Dislocated worker defined. As used in this section; section 1043, subsection 5,
39 paragraph B; and section 1191, subsection 4, paragraph A, the term "dislocated worker"
40 means an individual who is in training as approved by the deputy, under rules adopted by
41 the commissioner, and:

5 of employment, as a result of any permanent closure of a plant or facility; or
6 C. An individual who is long-term unemployed and has limited opportunities for
7 employment or reemployment in the same or a similar occupation in the area in which
8 the individual resides, including any older individual who may have substantial barriers
9 to employment because of the individual's age.
10 For the purposes of this section, "deputy" has the same meaning as in section 1192-A,
11 subsection 1, paragraph A.
12 1-A. Extended benefits for dislocated workers. A dislocated worker who has
13 exhausted the worker's benefit year within 30 months of the worker's enrollment in training
14 described in subsection 1 is entitled to the product of the worker's most recent weekly
15 benefit amount multiplied by the number of weeks in which that person is in approved
16 training, up to a maximum of 26 weeks, except that benefits may not be paid under this
17 subsection to a person:

8 sharing benefits available in a benefit year is considered an exhaustee for purposes of

13 amended to read:
14 2. Eligibility. An individual is deemed to have met the eligibility requirements under
15 section 1192, subsections 2 and 3 1192-A, subsection 2, paragraphs B, C and D as long as

3 SUMMARY
44 This bill amends the Unemployment Security Law in the following ways.
5 It allows the Department of Labor, Bureau of Unemployment Compensation to use
6 facial recognition technology for identity verification purposes.
7 It amends the definition of "unemployment fraud" to include instances when an
8 individual solicits someone else to file a fraudulent claim on the individual's behalf. The
9 provision governing grounds for disqualifying an individual from benefits is also amended
10 to include soliciting another person to make false statements or material omissions on
11 behalf of the individual. That provision is also amended to escalate the progression of
12 penalties in cases when a claim has been filed using illegally obtained identification
13 information such that the first offense is treated as a 3rd offense, which requires the highest
14 penalty.
15 It amends provisions governing overpayments made to individuals by the bureau. The
16 bill provides that the state minimum wage must be used to calculate the maximum amount
17 of weekly unemployment compensation benefits that may be withheld from an individual
18 who was overpaid by the bureau as the result of the individual's nondisclosure or
19 misrepresentation. This change increases the limitations on the amount of wages that may
20 be withheld. The bill provides that benefit overpayments recouped by reducing weekly
21 benefits must be applied only to the principal amount owed. The bill also changes the
22 appeal time frames for overpayment decisions to provide the same appeal time frames as
23 non-overpayment decisions.
24 It recodifies the section of law that governs eligibility for unemployment compensation
25 benefits. The bill also makes substantive changes to that section, including narrowing the
26 parameters defining an individual's availability for work to include work that aligns with
27 the customary hours and commute of the individual before becoming unemployed;
28 requiring that for certain training programs to qualify as approved training programs, those
29 programs must conform with rules adopted by the Commissioner of Labor; amending the
30 time frame during which an individual is excused from the work search requirements
31 during a period of layoff from the individual's employer and removing the requirement that
32 the individual stay in contact with the employer during that period; and modifying the
33 definition of "good cause" as it applies to an individual's failure to comply with certain
34 provisions governing the individual's eligibility for unemployment compensation benefits.
35 It amends the provision of law governing the bureau's process for determining
36 unemployment compensation benefit eligibility by creating several new exceptions from
37 that process. A claim is excepted from that process when an individual fails to perform a
38 work search and is not under a work search waiver; fails to adequately respond to a request
39 for identity verification; or is unemployed due to a stoppage of work.
40 It reorganizes provisions related to extended benefits for dislocated workers to conform
41 with modern drafting standards. The bill also changes those provisions to require that a
42 dislocated worker must be in training approved by a staff member of the bureau who has
43 been designated by the commissioner, in accordance with rules adopted by the
44 commissioner.
Page 16 - 132LR0140(01)

1 It eliminates the self-employment assistance program and cross-references to that
2 program. The bill also corrects and updates other cross-references.
3 Finally, it makes additional changes including changing the employer charging
4 methodology for employee leasing companies to report and pay contributions under the
5 client company, using the client company’s contribution rate and changing the time frame
6 for bureau staff background checks from every 10 years to every 5 years.
