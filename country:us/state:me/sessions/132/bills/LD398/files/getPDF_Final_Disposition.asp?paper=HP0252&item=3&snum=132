An Act to Amend the Definition of "Transient Occupancy" in the Laws
Governing the Maine Land Use Planning Commission
Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, the Legislature finds that it is desirable to extend principles of sound
planning, zoning and development to the unorganized and deorganized townships of the
State; and
Whereas, the Legislature desires to encourage appropriate use of these lands by the
residents of Maine and visitors in pursuit of outdoor recreation activities, including, but not
limited to, camping; and
Whereas, this legislation must take effect before the expiration of the 90-day period
since recreational camping season begins Memorial Day weekend in the month of May;
and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore,
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
Sec. 1. 12 MRSA ยง682, sub-ยง18, as amended by PL 2009, c. 16, ยง1, is further
amended to read:
18. Transient occupancy. "Transient occupancy" means occupancy that does not
exceed 120 150 days in a calendar year.
Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation
takes effect when approved.
