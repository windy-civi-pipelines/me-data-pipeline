7 SUMMARY
88 This bill amends the law governing the membership of the Waldo County Budget
99 Committee. The bill provides that if no municipal officer in a county commissioner district
1100 is willing to be nominated as a candidate for the county budget committee, any resident of
1111 the county commissioner district who is of voting age can be nominated in place of the
1122 municipal officer as long as the other 2 county budget committee members in the county
1133 commissioner district are municipal officers. The bill also removes the requirement that a
1144 budget committee member serving in the capacity of a municipal officer must maintain the
1155 member's status as a municipal officer during the member's term of office. The bill also
1166 removes the requirement that a person appointed to fill a vacancy be a municipal officer
1177 and permits any municipal resident of voting age who resides in the same municipality as
1188 the vacating member to fill the vacancy.
19 The bill also replaces the process for the adoption of the county budget by requiring
20 that, after a public hearing is completed, the budget committee adopt a final budget and
21 transmit that budget to the county commissioners. The county commissioners may not
22 increase, decrease, alter or revise the budget as adopted by the budget committee except by
23 unanimous vote of the county commissioners. The bill requires that if the adopted budget
24 is changed by the county commissioners, the budget committee may reject that change by
25 a 2/3 vote of its membership. The bill requires that the budget as adopted must be sent to
26 the county commissioners, and the county tax authorized must be apportioned and collected
27 in accordance with current law.
