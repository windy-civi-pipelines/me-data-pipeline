15 read:
16 2. Application for stabilization; continuation. An individual may apply by
17 December 1st to the municipality in which the individual's homestead is located requesting
18 that the municipality stabilize the property tax assessed on that individual's homestead for
19 the property tax year beginning on April 1st following the submission of the application.
20 A new application is required for each year for which stabilization is requested. If an
21 individual whose property tax is stabilized for a homestead pursuant to this chapter wants
22 the stabilization to continue, that individual shall file, for each subsequent property tax year
23 for which a continuation is desired, a request, in writing, indicating that the homestead is

28 under this section and establishes a new homestead in the State, the individual continues to

30 different municipality, at the request of the eligible individual, the municipality where
31 eligibility was first established shall notify the new municipality of the eligible individual's
32 previous eligibility and the amount at which the property taxes were stabilized. The the
33 new municipality shall bill the eligible individual at the stabilized amount stabilize the
34 property tax assessed on that individual's homestead for the property tax year beginning on
35 April 1st following the establishment of the new homestead, and the new municipality is
36 eligible for state compensation under subsection 5.
37 Sec. 5. Application. This Act applies to property tax years beginning on or after
38 April 1, 2025.
39 SUMMARY
4400 This bill amends the property tax stabilization program for senior citizens to make the
4411 following changes.
Page 1 - 132LR0323(01)
1 1. It extends the program to property tax years beginning on or after April 1, 2025.
2 2. It changes the eligibility requirements to require an individual to have been a
3 permanent Maine resident for at least 20 years and have a household income of no more
4 than $75,000 of federal adjusted gross income.
5 3. It simplifies the renewal of stabilization requirements, retaining the requirement in
6 current law that a request for stabilization be done annually, but requiring only that it be a
7 written statement that the household is still eligible under the program for stabilization.
8 4. It removes the ability of an individual who moves from one municipality to another
9 to retain the same stabilized property taxes assessed on the old property. Instead, the
10 individual's stabilized amount will be determined as of the date the individual moves to the
11 new homestead.
