28 the output of the distributed generation resource are allocated to the retail account
29 of that customer.
30 C. "Net energy billing" means a billing and metering practice under which a customer
31 is billed on the basis of the difference between the kilowatt‑hours delivered by a
32 transmission and distribution utility to the customer over a billing period and the
33 kilowatt‑hours delivered by the customer to the transmission and distribution utility
34 over the billing period, taking into account accumulated unused kilowatt‑hour credits
35 from the previous billing period.
36 D. "Project sponsor" means an entity or its successor or assignee that solicits customers
37 to participate in a net energy billing arrangement based upon a shared financial interest
38 in a distributed generation resource.
39 2. Financial interest required. The commission shall allow a customer to participate
40 in net energy billing if the customer has a financial interest in a distributed generation
41 resource or in a generation resource that has a net energy billing arrangement on the
Page 1 - 132LR0401(01)
412 effective date of this section, including facility ownership, a lease agreement or a power
423 purchase agreement.
3 3. Shared financial interest for investor-owned utility customers; limitation.
4 Multiple customers of an investor-owned transmission and distribution utility that have
5 distinct billing accounts with that utility may share a financial interest in a distributed
6 generation resource under subsection 2. Any number of customers of an investor-owned
7 transmission and distribution utility with a shared financial interest in a distributed
8 generation resource may participate in net energy billing, except that the number of eligible
9 customers or meters is limited to 10 for a shared financial interest in a distributed generation
10 resource located in the service territory of an investor-owned transmission and distribution
11 utility located in an area administered by the independent system administrator for northern
12 Maine or any successor of the independent system administrator for northern Maine unless
13 the commission determines that the utility's billing system can accommodate more than 10
14 accounts or meters for the purpose of net energy billing.
15 4. System size. The nameplate capacity of a distributed generation resource that may
16 be used for net energy billing must be less than 5 megawatts, except that, if a municipality
17 is the customer participating in net energy billing, the nameplate capacity of a distributed
18 generation resource located in that municipality that may be used for the net energy billing
19 may be 5 megawatts or more, as long as less than 5 megawatts of metered electricity from
20 the resource is used for net energy billing.
21 5. Consumer protection. To protect customers who participate in or are solicited to
22 participate in a net energy billing arrangement based upon a shared financial interest in a
23 distributed generation resource from fraud or unfair and deceptive business practices, a
24 project sponsor:
25 A. Must obtain a customer's explicit affirmative authorization before serving the
26 customer;
27 B. Must provide to a residential customer such information as the commission may
28 require by rule or order in a standard disclosure form before entering into an agreement

31 C. Must allow a customer to rescind the customer's decision to participate in a net
32 energy billing arrangement based upon a shared financial interest in a distributed
33 generation resource, as long as the customer requests such rescission orally or in
34 writing within 5 days of the customer's receipt of the first bill or invoice under the
35 arrangement that the customer is responsible for paying in full;
36 D. May not collect or seek to collect unreasonable costs from a customer who is in
37 default;
38 E. Must comply with any other applicable standards or requirements adopted by the
39 commission by rule or order;
40 F. May not release to any other entity, other than for purposes of debt collection or
41 credit reporting pursuant to state and federal law or to law enforcement agencies
42 pursuant to lawful process, any personal information regarding a customer, including

2 be used for net energy billing under this section must be less than 5 megawatts.
3 4. Shared financial interest; limitation. Multiple commercial or institutional
4 customers that have distinct billing accounts with an investor‑owned transmission and
5 distribution utility may share a financial interest in a distributed generation resource under
6 subsection 2. Any number of commercial or institutional customers may participate in net
7 energy billing with a shared interest in a distributed generation resource, except that the
8 number of customers or meters is limited to 10 for a shared interest in a distributed
9 generation resource located in the service territory of an investor‑owned transmission and
10 distribution utility located in an area administered by the independent system administrator
11 for northern Maine or any successor of the independent system administrator for northern
12 Maine unless the commission determines that the utility's billing system can accommodate
13 more than 10 accounts or meters for the purpose of net energy billing.
14 5. Tariff rate; bill credits. The commission shall establish by rule tariff rates for
15 customers participating in the program. The initial tariff rate must be established no later
16 than December 1, 2019.
17 A. The tariff rate for a customer participating in net energy billing with a distributed

27 affidavit with accompanying documentation to the commission that the entity,
28 before September 1, 2022, commenced on-site physical work of a significant
29 nature on the distributed generation resource and the entity has made and will
30 continue to make continuous on-site construction efforts to advance toward
31 completion of the distributed generation resource. For the purpose of this
32 paragraph, continuous on-site construction efforts include, but are not limited
33 to, in the context of a solar facility, the continuous installation of racks or other
34 structures to affix photovoltaic panels, collectors or solar cells to a site. The
35 commission may share information contained in the affidavit submitted in
36 accordance with this paragraph with a transmission and distribution utility, as
37 necessary, to verify a distributed generation resource's compliance with this
38 section. In administering this subsection, the commission may adopt rules
39 including, but not limited to, requiring the entity that submits a sworn affidavit
40 under this subparagraph to provide updated documentation to the commission
41 after submission of the affidavit; or
42 (b) The distributed generation resource is collocated with a net energy billing
43 customer that is or net energy billing customers that are subscribed to at least
44 50% of the facility's output; or
45 (2) With a nameplate capacity of one megawatt or less.
Page 6 - 132LR0401(01)
1 A-1. The tariff rate for a customer participating in net energy billing under this section
2 with a distributed generation resource not governed by paragraph A must:
3 (1) In 2022, equal the standard-offer service rate established pursuant to section
4 3212 that was applicable to the rate class of the customer receiving the credit on
5 December 31, 2020 plus 75% of the effective transmission and distribution rate
6 that was in effect on December 31, 2020 for the rate class that includes the smallest
7 commercial customers of the investor-owned transmission and distribution utility;
8 and
9 (2) Increase by 2.25% on January 1st of each subsequent year, beginning January
10 1, 2023.
11 B. A customer participating in the program must receive for electricity delivered to
12 the electric grid from a distributed generation resource in which the customer has a
13 financial interest a bill credit based on the tariff rate to apply against the costs of
14 electricity delivered to the customer by the investor‑owned transmission and
15 distribution utility.
16 C. A bill credit under the program as described in paragraph B may be applied to any
17 portion of a customer's electricity bill. Credits that remain unused at the end of any
18 billing period may be carried forward for up to one year from the end of that billing
19 period.
20 D. A customer participating in the program who remains eligible to participate in the
21 program must be allowed to receive a bill credit based on the tariff rate for a period of
22 no less than 20 years from the date of first receiving the credit.
23 6. Rules. The commission shall adopt rules to implement this section. Rules adopted
24 under this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375,
25 subchapter 2‑A.
26 7. Applicability. The applicability of this section is limited by the requirements of
27 section 3209‑A, subsection 7 and subsection 9.
28 8. Limitation. After December 31, 2023, a distributed generation resource may be
29 used for net energy billing under this section only if the distributed generation resource is
30 collocated with all of the distributed generation resource's net energy billing customers and
31 those customers are subscribed to 100% of the facility's output under this section. This
32 limitation does not apply to a distributed generation resource with a net energy billing
33 agreement that was executed on or before December 31, 2023. An amendment, revision or
34 reissuance of an agreement under this subsection that occurs after December 31, 2023 may
35 not be interpreted to affect the date on which the agreement was initially executed.
36 Sec. 4. 35-A MRSA §3209-C, sub-§1, ¶C, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 411, §5, is

35 SUMMARY
3366 This bill amends the net energy billing programs established under the Maine Revised
3377 Statutes, Title 35-A, sections 3209-A and 3209-B to prohibit customers from having a
3388 shared financial interest in distributed generation resources used for the programs. The bill
3399 limits the applicability of the net energy billing programs to distributed generation
4400 resources that are located on the same side of the meter as the net energy billing customer
4411 and are used primarily to serve the electric load of that customer. To participate in the
4422 programs, all of the net energy billing credits associated with the output of the distributed
Page 8 - 132LR0401(01)
413 generation resource must be allocated to the retail account of that customer. The bill also
424 amends other statutes to reflect the changes made to the net energy billing programs by this
435 bill.

28 the output of the distributed generation resource are allocated to the retail account
29 of that customer.
30 C. "Net energy billing" means a billing and metering practice under which a customer
31 is billed on the basis of the difference between the kilowatt‑hours delivered by a
32 transmission and distribution utility to the customer over a billing period and the
33 kilowatt‑hours delivered by the customer to the transmission and distribution utility
34 over the billing period, taking into account accumulated unused kilowatt‑hour credits
35 from the previous billing period.
36 D. "Project sponsor" means an entity or its successor or assignee that solicits customers
37 to participate in a net energy billing arrangement based upon a shared financial interest
38 in a distributed generation resource.
39 2. Financial interest required. The commission shall allow a customer to participate
40 in net energy billing if the customer has a financial interest in a distributed generation
41 resource or in a generation resource that has a net energy billing arrangement on the
Page 1 - 132LR0401(01)

412 effective date of this section, including facility ownership, a lease agreement or a power
423 purchase agreement.
3 3. Shared financial interest for investor-owned utility customers; limitation.
4 Multiple customers of an investor-owned transmission and distribution utility that have

15 4. System size. The nameplate capacity of a distributed generation resource that may
16 be used for net energy billing must be less than 5 megawatts, except that, if a municipality
17 is the customer participating in net energy billing, the nameplate capacity of a distributed
18 generation resource located in that municipality that may be used for the net energy billing
19 may be 5 megawatts or more, as long as less than 5 megawatts of metered electricity from
20 the resource is used for net energy billing.
21 5. Consumer protection. To protect customers who participate in or are solicited to
22 participate in a net energy billing arrangement based upon a shared financial interest in a

1 A-1. The tariff rate for a customer participating in net energy billing under this section
2 with a distributed generation resource not governed by paragraph A must:
3 (1) In 2022, equal the standard-offer service rate established pursuant to section
4 3212 that was applicable to the rate class of the customer receiving the credit on
5 December 31, 2020 plus 75% of the effective transmission and distribution rate
6 that was in effect on December 31, 2020 for the rate class that includes the smallest
7 commercial customers of the investor-owned transmission and distribution utility;
8 and
9 (2) Increase by 2.25% on January 1st of each subsequent year, beginning January
10 1, 2023.
11 B. A customer participating in the program must receive for electricity delivered to
12 the electric grid from a distributed generation resource in which the customer has a
13 financial interest a bill credit based on the tariff rate to apply against the costs of
14 electricity delivered to the customer by the investor‑owned transmission and
15 distribution utility.
16 C. A bill credit under the program as described in paragraph B may be applied to any
17 portion of a customer's electricity bill. Credits that remain unused at the end of any
18 billing period may be carried forward for up to one year from the end of that billing
19 period.
20 D. A customer participating in the program who remains eligible to participate in the
21 program must be allowed to receive a bill credit based on the tariff rate for a period of
22 no less than 20 years from the date of first receiving the credit.
23 6. Rules. The commission shall adopt rules to implement this section. Rules adopted
24 under this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375,
25 subchapter 2‑A.
26 7. Applicability. The applicability of this section is limited by the requirements of
27 section 3209‑A, subsection 7 and subsection 9.

35 SUMMARY
3366 This bill amends the net energy billing programs established under the Maine Revised
3377 Statutes, Title 35-A, sections 3209-A and 3209-B to prohibit customers from having a
3388 shared financial interest in distributed generation resources used for the programs. The bill
3399 limits the applicability of the net energy billing programs to distributed generation
4400 resources that are located on the same side of the meter as the net energy billing customer
4411 and are used primarily to serve the electric load of that customer. To participate in the
4422 programs, all of the net energy billing credits associated with the output of the distributed
Page 8 - 132LR0401(01)

413 generation resource must be allocated to the retail account of that customer. The bill also
424 amends other statutes to reflect the changes made to the net energy billing programs by this
435 bill.
