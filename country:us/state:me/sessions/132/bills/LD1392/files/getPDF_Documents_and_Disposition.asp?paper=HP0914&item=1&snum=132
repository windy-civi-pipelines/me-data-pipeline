1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, payroll processing regulations in this State require immediate modification
4 to clarify what types of employers are covered under the provisions of law governing
5 regulation of payroll processors and by extension clarify how remote workers are treated
6 under these provisions to ensure compliance with state laws and business regulations; and
7 Whereas, ensuring a clear legal framework for payroll processors and employers is
8 essential for economic stability and the proper administration of business regulations; and
9 Whereas, without immediate action, businesses may face uncertainty in payroll
10 processing, potentially leading to compliance issues, delayed wage payments and
11 administrative burdens for employers and employees; and
12 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
13 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
14 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
15 therefore,
16 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
17 Sec. 1. 10 MRSA ยง1495, sub-ยง1, as enacted by PL 1997, c. 495, ยง1, is amended to

20 transacts business a legal address in this State and makes payment of wages taxable under

22 "legal address" means the mailing address the employer requesting the payroll processing
23 services uses with the United States Internal Revenue Service.
24 Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation
25 takes effect when approved.
