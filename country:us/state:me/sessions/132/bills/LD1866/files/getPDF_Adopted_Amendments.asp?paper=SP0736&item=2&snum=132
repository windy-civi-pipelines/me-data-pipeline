21 the system improvements that supported that resolution, and the Legislature seeks to ensure
22 that those protections continue through the ongoing delivery of advocacy services in both
23 institutional and community settings.
24 2. Contract for protection and advocacy services. The department shall contract
25 with and make a good faith effort to obtain sufficient appropriations to fund the agency
26 designated under Title 5, section 19502 to carry out the duties related to protecting the
27 rights of individuals with serious mental illness in both institutional and community
28 settings. The contract must be consistent with the scope of authority and protections
29 provided in Title 5, chapter 511 and must ensure that advocacy services are provided
30 statewide through a presence in at least 5 geographically dispersed areas.
31 3. Access to state mental health institute records. In addition to the agency's
32 authority to access records under Title 5, chapter 511 and notwithstanding subsection 1207,
33 the agency contracted under subsection 2 may access medical records of individuals with
34 serious mental illness who are hospitalized in a state mental health institute as defined in
35 section 3801, subsection 9 when necessary to provide advocacy services as authorized
36 under Title 5.
