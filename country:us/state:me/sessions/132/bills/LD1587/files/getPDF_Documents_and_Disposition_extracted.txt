23 SUMMARY
2244 This bill codifies into the Maine Revised Statutes provisions of the federal Fair Labor
2255 Standards Act of 1938 and creates a criminal penalty for any person who intentionally or
2266 knowingly violates the employment practices laws or the laws governing preference to
2277 Maine works and contractors. A person convicted of a willful violation is subject to a fine
2288 of not more than $10,000 or to imprisonment of not more than 6 months, or both, except
2299 that a person may not be imprisoned unless that person has been previously found guilty of
3300 willfully violating these laws. The Director of Labor Standards within the Department of
3311 Labor may refer these violations to the Attorney General for prosecution. The Attorney
3322 General must respond to the director within 30 days of receiving the referral, indicating
3333 whether the Attorney General will prosecute the case. If the Attorney General declines to
3344 prosecute, the Attorney General must provide to the director the reasons for the denial.
35 This bill also requires that any information related to these willful violations must be
36 included in the department's annual report, including any fines sought or collected by the
37 department, the number of referrals made by the director and the number of referrals
38 declined by the Attorney General, including the reasons for the denials.
