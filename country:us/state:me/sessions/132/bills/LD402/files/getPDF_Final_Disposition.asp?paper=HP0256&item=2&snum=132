11 SUMMARY
1122 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, makes technical
1133 corrections to the bill.
14 The amendment provides that the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife may
15 not adopt rules to protect plants and plant communities under the Maine Revised Statutes,
16 Title 12, chapter 925, subchapter 4, which is enacted in the bill and relates to natural areas,
17 research and management, except when required for the conservation of rare, threatened or
18 endangered fish or wildlife.
19 The amendment strikes from the bill a provision relating to consistency review of
20 comprehensive plans under the municipal growth management program laws; the proposed
21 provision creates a duplicative process for the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife.
22 The amendment also requires the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to
23 provide a report, including any findings and recommendations, no later than January 15,
24 2027, to the joint standing committees of the Legislature having jurisdiction over inland
25 fisheries and wildlife matters and agriculture, conservation and forestry matters on the
26 transfer of the Natural Areas Program from the Department of Agriculture, Conservation
27 and Forestry to the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. Each committee may
28 submit legislation related to the subject matter of the report to the 133rd Legislature in
29 2027.
30 The amendment also adds an appropriations and allocations section.
