COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 945, L.D. 1436
1 SUMMARY
22 This amendment changes the definition of "cellular or wireless telecommunications
33 service" in current law to clarify that required timing of the payment does not affect whether
44 a service meets the definition of "cellular or wireless telecommunications service." It also
55 removes changes made by the bill to the definition of "prepaid wireless telecommunications
66 service" except for changing E-9-1-1 to 9-1-1. Lastly, it specifies that the statewide 9-1-1
77 surcharge under the bill must be shown on a customer's bill separately when practicable,
88 and, when disclosure is not practicable, the local exchange telephone utility, cellular or
99 wireless telecommunications service provider or interconnected voice over Internet
1100 protocol service provider is required to make the information regarding the amount of the
1111 surcharge available to the customer in another manner.
