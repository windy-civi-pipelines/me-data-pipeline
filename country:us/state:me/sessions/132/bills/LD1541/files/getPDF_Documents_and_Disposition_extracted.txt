9 SUMMARY
1100 This bill amends the property tax stabilization for senior citizens program, which was

12 1. Changing the benefit under the program to a complete exemption from property
13 taxes, for property tax years beginning on or after April 1, 2027;
14 2. Specifying that an eligible individual is someone who is at least 65 years of age, or
15 who will attain 65 years of age during the property tax year for which the exemption is
16 requested, and has maintained a permanent residence in this State for at least 10 consecutive
17 years prior to applying for the exemption;
18 3. Removing the requirement that an applicant apply every year for the exemption,
19 instead requiring that the eligible individual file an affidavit declaring that the individual is
20 still eligible for the exemption;
21 4. Allowing the transfer of the exemption only if the transferee jointly owns the
22 homestead and is eligible under the program; and
23 5. Requiring the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability, in
24 2030, to conduct a review of the program, considering:
25 A. Whether the exemption fulfills its goal of decreasing the tax burden on senior
26 residents of this State and allowing them to continue to reside in their homes; and
27 B. Performance measures such as whether the program is fiscally sustainable and may
28 be expanded or modified.
29 The office is required to submit, by January 15, 2031, a report with its findings to the
30 Government Oversight Committee and to the joint standing committee of the Legislature
31 having jurisdiction over taxation matters, which may report out a bill related to the report
