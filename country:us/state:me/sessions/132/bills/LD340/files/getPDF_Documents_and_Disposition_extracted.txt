11 §1493. Waiver of speedy trial right
12 A defendant may waive the defendant's right to a speedy trial under this Act. The

15 §1494. Enlargement of time
16 1. Enlargement of time; factors. The court, for good cause, may grant a motion to

20 outweigh the interests of the public and the interest of the defendant in a speedy trial. In
21 making this determination, the court shall consider, at a minimum, the following factors:
22 A. Whether the failure to grant the motion for enlargement of time is likely to make
23 continuation of the proceeding impossible or to result in a miscarriage of justice;
24 B. Whether the case is so unusual or so complex, due to the number of defendants, the
25 number of counts, the nature of the prosecution or the existence of novel questions of
26 fact or law, that it is unreasonable to expect adequate preparation for pretrial
27 proceedings or for the trial within the applicable time limit established by section 1492;
28 and
29 C. Whether the failure to grant the motion for enlargement of time would unreasonably
30 deny the defendant or the State continuity of counsel, would limit the availability of
31 witnesses for the defendant or the State or would deny counsel for the defendant or the
32 attorney for the State the reasonable time necessary for effective preparation, taking
33 into account the exercise of due diligence.
34 2. Consideration of certain factors prohibited. A court may not consider either the
35 general congestion of the court's calendar or lack of diligent preparation on the part of the
36 attorney for the State as factors weighing in favor of granting an enlargement of time under
37 this section.
38 §1495. Remedy for noncompliance with time limit
39 1. Motion by defendant or court. The defendant, by motion, or the court, acting sua
40 sponte, may raise the issue of noncompliance with the applicable time limit established by
41 section 1492.
Page 3 - 132LR0008(01)
1 2. Procedure on motion. Notice of the motion under subsection 1 and an opportunity
2 to be heard must be provided to the defendant and to the attorney for the State.
3 3. Remedy; factors. The court shall dismiss the case, with or without prejudice, if it
4 determines that the defendant's trial did not commence within the applicable time limit
5 established by section 1492 and any enlargement of that time limit ordered under section
6 1494. In making a determination whether to dismiss the case with or without prejudice,
7 the court shall consider, at a minimum, the following factors:
8 A. The seriousness of the offense;
9 B. The facts and circumstances of the case that prompted the filing of the motion to
10 dismiss;
11 C. Whether the State can initiate future criminal proceedings based on the conduct
12 underlying the dismissed case and the impact of such a prosecution on the
13 administration of justice;
14 D. An objection made by a victim pursuant to Title 17-A, section 2110; and
15 E. Any other factor the court considers relevant.
16 Sec. 2. 17-A MRSA §2102, sub-§1, ¶F-2, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 330, §6 and
17 reallocated by RR 2021, c. 1, Pt. A, §14, is amended to read:
18 F-2. The final disposition of the charges against the defendant, including the amount
19 of deductions to time served that a defendant has accumulated as of the date of
20 sentencing. On or before the date of sentencing, the attorney for the State shall obtain
21 information about the deductions to time served from each correctional facility at
22 which a defendant was detained prior to sentencing on the relevant charges; and
23 Sec. 3. 17-A MRSA §2102, sub-§1, ¶F-3 is enacted to read:
24 F-3. The time and place of any hearing under Title 15, section 1495, subsection 2 to
25 determine the remedy for noncompliance with the Maine Speedy Trial Act and the right
26 to be heard; and
27 Sec. 4. 17-A MRSA §2110 is enacted to read:
28 §2110. Procedure on motion to dismiss for violation of Maine Speedy Trial Act
29 When the attorney for the State receives notice of a motion under Title 15, section 1495
30 seeking dismissal of charges for noncompliance with the Maine Speedy Trial Act, the
31 attorney for the State shall disclose to the court any attempts made to notify each victim
32 and any objection by a victim. In a proceeding to determine the remedy for noncompliance
33 with the Maine Speedy Trial Act, if a victim is present in court, the victim may address the
34 court at that time.
35 SUMMARY
3366 This bill establishes the Maine Speedy Trial Act. The Act establishes different time
3377 limits for the commencement of a defendant's criminal trial depending on when the
3388 complaint, indictment or information was filed and what class of crime the defendant is
3399 charged with. The Act also provides a time limit for the commencement of a new trial
4400 following a mistrial or order for a new trial. A defendant may waive the right to a speedy
Page 4 - 132LR0008(01)
411 trial under the Act after the defendant has been advised of the defendant's rights with
422 respect to the Act by the court.
3 The Act also establishes several reasons for delay, which are excluded in computing
4 the time limits for the commencement of trial; factors the court may consider when granting
5 a motion to enlarge the maximum time period before commencement of trial; and remedies
6 available to the defendant when the time limits established by the Act are not complied
7 with.
8 Upon motion by the defendant, the court must dismiss the case either with or without
9 prejudice if it finds that the defendant's trial did not commence within the applicable time
10 limit or any enlargement of that limit. Any victim of the crime for which the defendant is
11 charged must be notified of any hearing to determine whether the defendant's rights under
12 the Act have been violated, and that victim may object to the dismissal of charges and may
13 be heard by the court at the time of that hearing.
