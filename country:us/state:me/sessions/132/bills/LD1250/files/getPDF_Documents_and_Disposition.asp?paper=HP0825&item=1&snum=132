1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 35-A MRSA §3210, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2023, c. 361, §1, is further
3 amended to read:
4 3. Portfolio requirements; Class II resources. As a condition of licensing pursuant
5 to section 3203, each competitive electricity provider in this State must demonstrate in a
6 manner satisfactory to the commission that no less than 30% of its portfolio of supply
7 sources for retail electricity sales in this State is accounted for by Class II resources. If a
8 competitive electricity provider represents to a customer that the provider is selling to the
9 customer a portfolio of supply sources that includes more than 30% Class II resources, the
10 resources necessary to supply more than 30% of that customer's load may not be applied to
11 meet the aggregate 30% portfolio requirement. A portfolio requirement under this
12 subsection applies only to an actual retail electricity sale. Rules adopted under this
13 subsection are major substantive rules pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.
14 A. For the purposes of meeting the portfolio requirement under this subsection, a 300%
15 multiplier is applied to the output of a generator fueled by municipal solid waste in
16 conjunction with recycling that has obtained a solid waste facility license from the
17 Department of Environmental Protection.
