26 passage of this resolution, to vote upon the ratification of the amendment proposed in this
27 resolution by voting upon the following question:
28 "Do you favor amending the Constitution of Maine to reduce the size of
29 the Senate from no more than 35 members to 32 members by
30 reapportioning senatorial districts to coincide with the counties of the
31 State, effective December 2, 2026?"
32 The legal voters of each city, town and plantation shall vote by ballot on this question
33 and designate their choice by a cross or check mark placed within the corresponding square
34 below the word "Yes" or "No." The ballots must be received, sorted, counted and declared
35 in open ward, town and plantation meetings and returns made to the Secretary of State in
36 the same manner as votes for members of the Legislature. The Governor shall review the
37 returns. If it appears that a majority of the legal votes are cast in favor of the amendment,
38 the Governor shall proclaim that fact without delay and the amendment becomes part of
39 the Constitution of Maine on the date of the proclamation.
40 Secretary of State shall prepare ballots. Resolved: That the Secretary of State
41 shall prepare and furnish to each city, town and plantation all ballots, returns and copies of
42 this resolution necessary to carry out the purposes of this referendum.
