7 direction of the Governor, to issue bonds in the name and on behalf of the State in an
8 amount not exceeding $10,000,000 for the purposes described in section 5 of this Part. The
9 bonds are a pledge of the full faith and credit of the State. The bonds may not run for a
10 period longer than 10 years from the date of the original issue of the bonds.
11 Sec. A-2. Records of bonds issued; Treasurer of State. The Treasurer of State

14 and the date when payable.
15 Sec. A-3. Sale; how negotiated; proceeds appropriated. The Treasurer of
16 State may negotiate the sale of the bonds by direction of the Governor, but no bond may
17 be loaned, pledged or hypothecated on behalf of the State. The proceeds of the sale of the
18 bonds, which must be held by the Treasurer of State and paid by the Treasurer of State
19 upon warrants drawn by the State Controller, are appropriated solely for the purposes set
20 forth in this Part. Any unencumbered balances remaining at the completion of the project
21 in this Part lapse to the Office of the Treasurer of State to be used for the retirement of
22 general obligation bonds.

24 due or accruing on any bonds issued under this Part and all sums coming due for payment
25 of bonds at maturity.

38 all unencumbered appropriation balances representing state money carry forward. Bond
39 proceeds that have not been expended within 10 years after the date of the sale of the bonds
40 lapse to the Office of the Treasurer of State to be used for the retirement of general
41 obligation bonds.
