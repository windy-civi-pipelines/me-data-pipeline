Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, in response to the economic hardship facing the State's restaurants, bars,
grocery stores and beverage retailers; in response to the diversity and new product
innovation in the beverage industry; and in support of local craft manufacturers' ability to
showcase their products at taste-testing events, it is necessary to amend statutory language
to allow wholesalers of wine and malt liquor products to hold taste-testing events at a
greater number of locations; and
Whereas, unless this legislation is enacted as an emergency, interested parties will
not be able to take advantage of this legislation until after the majority of the busy summer
season has concluded; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore,
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
Sec. 1. 28-A MRSA §1402, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2021, c. 658, §236, is

Sec. 2. 28-A MRSA §1402, sub-§3, ¶D, as amended by PL 2021, c. 658, §237, is
