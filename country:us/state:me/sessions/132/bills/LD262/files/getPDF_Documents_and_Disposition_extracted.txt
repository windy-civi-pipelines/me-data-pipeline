1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, in response to the economic hardship facing the State's restaurants, bars,
4 grocery stores and beverage retailers; in response to the diversity and new product
5 innovation in the beverage industry; and in support of local craft manufacturers' ability to
6 showcase their products at taste-testing events, it is necessary to amend statutory language
7 to allow wholesalers of wine and malt liquor products to hold taste-testing events at a
8 greater number of locations; and
9 Whereas, unless this legislation is enacted as an emergency, interested parties will
10 not be able to take advantage of this legislation until after the majority of the busy summer
11 season has concluded; and
12 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
13 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
14 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
15 therefore,
16 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
17 Sec. 1. 28-A MRSA §1402, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2021, c. 658, §236, is
18 further amended to read:
19 2. Taste testing on retail licensee's premises or other venue. With the bureau's
20 written permission, a wholesale licensee may rent or lease an area or room from an on-
21 premises retail licensee or from any unlicensed venue for the purpose of inviting retail
22 licensees to taste test wine or malt liquor products.
23 Sec. 2. 28-A MRSA §1402, sub-§3, ¶D, as amended by PL 2021, c. 658, §237, is
24 further amended to read:
25 D. After the taste-testing event is concluded, the wholesale licensee shall remove all
26 products supplied for the taste-testing event from the premises of the retail licensee's
27 premises licensee or unlicensed venue.
28 Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation
29 takes effect when approved.
30 SUMMARY
3311 This bill modifies the law governing taste-testing events held by malt liquor and wine
3322 wholesale licensees. Under current law, wholesale licensees may rent or lease an area from
3333 a retail licensee for the purpose of inviting retail licensees to taste test wine or malt liquor
3344 products. The bill broadens a wholesale licensee's ability to hold such a taste-testing event
3355 by also allowing the wholesale licensee to rent or lease an unlicensed venue for that
3366 purpose.
