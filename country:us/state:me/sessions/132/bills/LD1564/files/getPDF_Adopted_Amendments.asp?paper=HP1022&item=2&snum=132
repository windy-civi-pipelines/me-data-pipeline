3 B. Beginning July 15, 2025 2026, a commingling group shall ensure that all initiators

15 costs to a dealer, redemption center or other person for, a beverage container that has been
16 processed by a reverse vending machine or account-based bulk processing program in a
17 way that has, for a nonrefillable beverage container, reduced the recycling value of the
18 container below current market value or, for a refillable beverage container, has damaged
19 the container in a manner that prevents its reuse. This subsection may not be interpreted to
20 prohibit a written processing agreement between a commingling group and a dealer or
21 redemption center and does not relieve a commingling group of its obligation under
22 subsection 8‑A to accept empty, unbroken and reasonably clean beverage containers.
23 Beginning July 15, 2025 2026, the cooperative, on behalf of its member commingling
24 groups, shall negotiate agreements with dealers and redemption centers regarding
25 processing payments for each beverage container material type. The department shall

27 and the rules may authorize the use of a 3rd-party vendor to determine if a beverage
28 container has been processed by a reverse vending machine or account-based bulk
29 processing program in a manner that, for a nonrefillable beverage container, has reduced
30 the recycling value below current market value or, for a refillable beverage container, has
31 damaged the container in a manner that prevents its reuse. The rules must outline the
32 method of allocating among the parties involved the payment for 3rd-party vendor costs.
33 Sec. 3. 38 MRSA §3106, sub-§8-A, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 482, §17, is amended
34 to read:

37 this subsection, a designated pick-up entity has the obligation to ensure the timely pickup
38 and recycling of all empty, unbroken and reasonably clean beverage containers subject to

8 under this subsection apply only to those beverage containers from the initiators of
9 deposit that are members of that commingling group.

11 a minimum, establish pickup frequency standards based on the volume of beverage
12 containers collected by each dealer or redemption center, accounting for any
13 irregularities in volume, in a manner that promotes communication between designated
14 pick-up entities and dealers and redemption centers and that increases transportation
15 efficiency while maintaining the level of service provided to dealers and redemption
16 centers such that dealers and redemption centers are not required to store collected
17 beverage containers for extended periods of time without contact from and
18 compensation provided by the designated pick-up entity. Rules adopted pursuant to

35 agreement pursuant to this section, commingling of beverage containers must be by all
36 containers of like deposit value, product group, material and size. Initiators of deposit may
37 not require dealers or redemption centers to further sort containers that belong to the
38 commingling group. This subsection does not prevent further commingling of containers
39 if requested by the responsible commingling group or the cooperative. An initiator of
40 deposit required pursuant to section 3106, subsection 8 or 8‑A to pick up beverage
41 containers subject to a commingling agreement also shall pick up all other beverage
42 containers subject to the same agreement. The initiator of deposit may not require beverage

12 processing program are not required to sort material by color, deposit value or size but must

27 reimbursement within 6 weeks of receipt of the request.
28 6. It clarifies that portion of the law regulating unclaimed deposits for nonrefillable
29 beverage containers in the event that a department-approved program plan for the single
30 commingling program is not implemented by the cooperative.
31 7. It removes the provisions of law that repeal on July 15, 2025 the requirement for
32 initiators of deposit and pick-up agents to report annually to the department certain
