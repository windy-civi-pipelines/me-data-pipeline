Container Redemption Law and to Make Other Necessary Changes to That
Law
Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, this legislation must take effect before the expiration of the 90-day period
so that certain changes to the laws governing manufacturers, distributors and dealers of
beverage containers enacted by Public Law 2023, chapter 482 are clarified prior to the
implementation date of those changes; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore,
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
Sec. 1. 38 MRSA §3105, sub-§5, as amended by PL 2023, c. 482, §12, is further
amended to read:

Section 2:
5. Label registration. An initiator of deposit shall register the container label of any
beverage offered for sale in the State on which it initiates a deposit. Registration must be
on forms or in an electronic format provided by the department prior to July 15, 2025 2026
and by the cooperative beginning July 15, 2025 2026 and must include the universal
product code for each combination of beverage and container manufactured. The initiator
of deposit shall renew a label registration annually and whenever that label is revised by
altering the universal product code or whenever the container on which it appears is
changed in size, composition or glass color. The initiator of deposit shall also include as
part of the registration identification of a collection agent, identification of all of the parties
to a commingling agreement that applies to the container and proof of the collection
agreement.
A. Prior to July 15, 2025 2026, the department may charge a fee for registration and
registration renewals under this subsection.
Page 1 - 132LR2018(03)
B. Beginning July 15, 2025 2026, a commingling group shall ensure that all initiators
of deposit participating in the commingling group provide to the cooperative accurate
and up-to-date label registration information required by this subsection and that any
updates to label registrations are provided to the cooperative at least 30 days prior to
introduction for sale in the State. The cooperative shall ensure that accurate and up-to-
date information regarding all label registrations is shared with entities using or
administering reverse vending machine and account-based bulk processing programs
and is made available on its publicly accessible website.
Sec. 2. 38 MRSA §3106, sub-§6, as amended by PL 2023, c. 482, §15 and affected
by §43, is further amended to read:

Section 3:
6. Obligation to preserve container value. Notwithstanding subsection 8‑A, a
commingling group or its agent may refuse to accept, or pay the refund value and handling
costs to a dealer, redemption center or other person for, a beverage container that has been
processed by a reverse vending machine or account-based bulk processing program in a
way that has, for a nonrefillable beverage container, reduced the recycling value of the
container below current market value or, for a refillable beverage container, has damaged
the container in a manner that prevents its reuse. This subsection may not be interpreted to
prohibit a written processing agreement between a commingling group and a dealer or
redemption center and does not relieve a commingling group of its obligation under
subsection 8‑A to accept empty, unbroken and reasonably clean beverage containers.
Beginning July 15, 2025 2026, the cooperative, on behalf of its member commingling
groups, shall negotiate agreements with dealers and redemption centers regarding
processing payments for each beverage container material type. The department shall
adopt rules to establish the recycling value of beverage containers under this subsection
and the rules may authorize the use of a 3rd-party vendor to determine if a beverage
container has been processed by a reverse vending machine or account-based bulk
processing program in a manner that, for a nonrefillable beverage container, has reduced
the recycling value below current market value or, for a refillable beverage container, has
damaged the container in a manner that prevents its reuse. The rules must outline the
method of allocating among the parties involved the payment for 3rd-party vendor costs.
Sec. 3. 38 MRSA §3106, sub-§8-A, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 482, §17, is amended
to read:
8-A. Obligation to pick up and recycle containers. Beginning October 15, 2024, in
In accordance with the requirements of this subsection and the rules adopted pursuant to
this subsection, a designated pick-up entity has the obligation to ensure the timely pickup
and recycling of all empty, unbroken and reasonably clean beverage containers subject to
the requirements of this chapter from dealers and redemption centers, including from any
locations where an account-based bulk processing program is in operation. As used in this
subsection, "designated pick-up entity" means, prior to July 15, 2025 until the cooperative
implements a department-approved program plan pursuant to section 3107, subsection 3-B,
paragraph C or for any period of time in which a department-approved program plan is not
implemented, a commingling group or its pick-up agent and, beginning July 15, 2025 or,
for any period of time in which a department-approved program plan is implemented, the
cooperative or its pick-up agent or agents.
Page 2 - 132LR2018(03)
A. Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection to the contrary, prior to July 15,
2025 until the cooperative implements a department-approved program plan pursuant
to section 3107, subsection 3-B, paragraph C or for any period of time in which a
department-approved program plan is not implemented, in the case of a designated
pick-up entity that is a commingling group, the commingling group's responsibilities
under this subsection apply only to those beverage containers from the initiators of
deposit that are members of that commingling group.
B. The department shall adopt rules to implement this subsection. The rules must, at
a minimum, establish pickup frequency standards based on the volume of beverage
containers collected by each dealer or redemption center, accounting for any
irregularities in volume, in a manner that promotes communication between designated
pick-up entities and dealers and redemption centers and that increases transportation
efficiency while maintaining the level of service provided to dealers and redemption
centers such that dealers and redemption centers are not required to store collected
beverage containers for extended periods of time without contact from and
compensation provided by the designated pick-up entity. Rules adopted pursuant to
this paragraph are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter
2‑A.
Sec. 4. 38 MRSA §3106, sub-§9, as amended by PL 2023, c. 482, §18, is further
amended to read:

Section 4:
9. Plastic bags. Plastic bags used by a dealer or redemption center and the cost
allocation of these bags must conform to rules adopted by the department concerning size
and gauge. Beginning July 15, 2025, the cooperative shall provide to the dealer or
redemption center, or the plastic bags to be used by the dealer or redemption center to
contain redeemed beverage containers or, within 6 weeks of receipt of a request for
reimbursement from the dealer or redemption center for the cost of such plastic bags used
by the dealer or redemption center, reimburse the dealer or redemption center for the cost
of, the plastic bags used by the dealer or redemption center to contain redeemed beverage
containers those requested costs.
Sec. 5. 38 MRSA §3107, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2023, c. 482, §22, is further
amended to read:

Section 5:
1. Commingling requirement. If initiators of deposit enter into a commingling
agreement pursuant to this section, commingling of beverage containers must be by all
containers of like deposit value, product group, material and size. Initiators of deposit may
not require dealers or redemption centers to further sort containers that belong to the
commingling group. This subsection does not prevent further commingling of containers
if requested by the responsible commingling group or the cooperative. An initiator of
deposit required pursuant to section 3106, subsection 8 or 8‑A to pick up beverage
containers subject to a commingling agreement also shall pick up all other beverage
containers subject to the same agreement. The initiator of deposit may not require beverage
containers that are subject to a commingling agreement to be sorted separately by a dealer
or redemption center. A dealer or redemption center that processes beverage containers
using a reverse vending machine or account-based bulk processing program is not required
to sort material by color, in accordance with subsection 2, paragraphs E to H, deposit value
or size but must comply with the requirements of section 3106, subsection 6.

2026, complete the transition from beverage container sorting at redemption
centers by brand to sorting by material type and, for redemption centers that

BY GOVERNOR PUBLIC LAW
STATE OF MAINE
_____
IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD
TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE
_____
H.P. 1022 - L.D. 1564
An Act to Delay Implementation of Certain Recent Changes to the Beverage
Container Redemption Law and to Make Other Necessary Changes to That
Law
Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, this legislation must take effect before the expiration of the 90-day period
so that certain changes to the laws governing manufacturers, distributors and dealers of
beverage containers enacted by Public Law 2023, chapter 482 are clarified prior to the
implementation date of those changes; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore,
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
Sec. 1. 38 MRSA §3105, sub-§5, as amended by PL 2023, c. 482, §12, is further
amended to read:
5. Label registration. An initiator of deposit shall register the container label of any
beverage offered for sale in the State on which it initiates a deposit. Registration must be
on forms or in an electronic format provided by the department prior to July 15, 2025 2026
and by the cooperative beginning July 15, 2025 2026 and must include the universal
product code for each combination of beverage and container manufactured. The initiator
of deposit shall renew a label registration annually and whenever that label is revised by
altering the universal product code or whenever the container on which it appears is
changed in size, composition or glass color. The initiator of deposit shall also include as
part of the registration identification of a collection agent, identification of all of the parties
to a commingling agreement that applies to the container and proof of the collection
agreement.
A. Prior to July 15, 2025 2026, the department may charge a fee for registration and
registration renewals under this subsection.
Page 1 - 132LR2018(03)

B. Beginning July 15, 2025 2026, a commingling group shall ensure that all initiators
of deposit participating in the commingling group provide to the cooperative accurate
and up-to-date label registration information required by this subsection and that any
updates to label registrations are provided to the cooperative at least 30 days prior to
introduction for sale in the State. The cooperative shall ensure that accurate and up-to-
date information regarding all label registrations is shared with entities using or
administering reverse vending machine and account-based bulk processing programs
and is made available on its publicly accessible website.
Sec. 2. 38 MRSA §3106, sub-§6, as amended by PL 2023, c. 482, §15 and affected
by §43, is further amended to read:
6. Obligation to preserve container value. Notwithstanding subsection 8‑A, a
commingling group or its agent may refuse to accept, or pay the refund value and handling
costs to a dealer, redemption center or other person for, a beverage container that has been
processed by a reverse vending machine or account-based bulk processing program in a
way that has, for a nonrefillable beverage container, reduced the recycling value of the
container below current market value or, for a refillable beverage container, has damaged
the container in a manner that prevents its reuse. This subsection may not be interpreted to
prohibit a written processing agreement between a commingling group and a dealer or
redemption center and does not relieve a commingling group of its obligation under
subsection 8‑A to accept empty, unbroken and reasonably clean beverage containers.
Beginning July 15, 2025 2026, the cooperative, on behalf of its member commingling
groups, shall negotiate agreements with dealers and redemption centers regarding
processing payments for each beverage container material type. The department shall
adopt rules to establish the recycling value of beverage containers under this subsection
and the rules may authorize the use of a 3rd-party vendor to determine if a beverage
container has been processed by a reverse vending machine or account-based bulk
processing program in a manner that, for a nonrefillable beverage container, has reduced
the recycling value below current market value or, for a refillable beverage container, has
damaged the container in a manner that prevents its reuse. The rules must outline the
method of allocating among the parties involved the payment for 3rd-party vendor costs.
Sec. 3. 38 MRSA §3106, sub-§8-A, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 482, §17, is amended
to read:
8-A. Obligation to pick up and recycle containers. Beginning October 15, 2024, in
In accordance with the requirements of this subsection and the rules adopted pursuant to
this subsection, a designated pick-up entity has the obligation to ensure the timely pickup
and recycling of all empty, unbroken and reasonably clean beverage containers subject to
the requirements of this chapter from dealers and redemption centers, including from any

A. Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection to the contrary, prior to July 15,
2025 until the cooperative implements a department-approved program plan pursuant
to section 3107, subsection 3-B, paragraph C or for any period of time in which a
department-approved program plan is not implemented, in the case of a designated
pick-up entity that is a commingling group, the commingling group's responsibilities
under this subsection apply only to those beverage containers from the initiators of
deposit that are members of that commingling group.
B. The department shall adopt rules to implement this subsection. The rules must, at
a minimum, establish pickup frequency standards based on the volume of beverage
containers collected by each dealer or redemption center, accounting for any
irregularities in volume, in a manner that promotes communication between designated
pick-up entities and dealers and redemption centers and that increases transportation
efficiency while maintaining the level of service provided to dealers and redemption
centers such that dealers and redemption centers are not required to store collected
beverage containers for extended periods of time without contact from and
compensation provided by the designated pick-up entity. Rules adopted pursuant to
this paragraph are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter
2‑A.

agreement pursuant to this section, commingling of beverage containers must be by all
containers of like deposit value, product group, material and size. Initiators of deposit may
not require dealers or redemption centers to further sort containers that belong to the
commingling group. This subsection does not prevent further commingling of containers
if requested by the responsible commingling group or the cooperative. An initiator of
deposit required pursuant to section 3106, subsection 8 or 8‑A to pick up beverage
containers subject to a commingling agreement also shall pick up all other beverage
containers subject to the same agreement. The initiator of deposit may not require beverage
containers that are subject to a commingling agreement to be sorted separately by a dealer
or redemption center. A dealer or redemption center that processes beverage containers
using a reverse vending machine or account-based bulk processing program is not required
to sort material by color, in accordance with subsection 2, paragraphs E to H, deposit value
or size but must comply with the requirements of section 3106, subsection 6.
