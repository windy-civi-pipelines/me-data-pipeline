1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, this legislation must take effect before the expiration of the 90-day period
4 so that changes to the laws governing manufacturers, distributors and dealers of beverage
5 containers take effect before July 15, 2025; and
6 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
7 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
8 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
9 therefore,
10 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
11 Sec. 1. 38 MRSA §3105, sub-§5, as amended by PL 2023, c. 482, §12, is further
12 amended to read:
13 5. Label registration. An initiator of deposit shall register the container label of any
14 beverage offered for sale in the State on which it initiates a deposit. Registration must be
15 on forms or in an electronic format provided by the department prior to July 15, 2025 2026
16 and by the cooperative beginning July 15, 2025 2026 and must include the universal
17 product code for each combination of beverage and container manufactured. The initiator
18 of deposit shall renew a label registration annually and whenever that label is revised by
19 altering the universal product code or whenever the container on which it appears is
20 changed in size, composition or glass color. The initiator of deposit shall also include as
21 part of the registration identification of a collection agent, identification of all of the parties
22 to a commingling agreement that applies to the container and proof of the collection
23 agreement.

25 registration renewals under this subsection.
26 B. Beginning July 15, 2025 2026, a commingling group shall ensure that all initiators
27 of deposit participating in the commingling group provide to the cooperative accurate
28 and up-to-date label registration information required by this subsection and that any
29 updates to label registrations are provided to the cooperative at least 30 days prior to
30 introduction for sale in the State. The cooperative shall ensure that accurate and up-to-
31 date information regarding all label registrations is shared with entities using or
32 administering reverse vending machine and account-based bulk processing programs
33 and is made available on its publicly accessible website.
34 Sec. 2. 38 MRSA §3106, sub-§5-A, ¶D, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 482, §14, is
35 amended to read:
36 D. A distributor that had beverage container costs apportioned to it by a dealer or
37 redemption center using an alternative apportionment method under a waiver approved
38 pursuant to this section may apply to the department for reimbursement of beverage
39 container costs or other financial losses incurred as a direct result of the alternative
40 apportionment method if the distributor can demonstrate to the department's
41 satisfaction that the distributor:
Page 1 - 132LR2018(01)

1 (1) Would have been paid additional beverage container costs if the distributor's
2 beverage containers were processed through a reverse vending machine or similar
3 technology that scanned each container; or
4 (2) Otherwise suffered a financial loss as a direct result of the alternative
5 apportionment method implemented under the waiver.
6 A distributor must submit a request for reimbursement under this paragraph prior to
7 December 31, 2025 2026. If the department determines that a distributor is eligible for
8 reimbursement under this paragraph, the department shall reimburse the distributor
9 using funds from the Cost and Carbon Efficient Technology Fund established under
10 section 3114‑A.
11 Sec. 3. 38 MRSA §3106, sub-§5-A, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 482, §14, is amended
12 by amending the 2nd blocked paragraph to read:
13 On or before February 15, 2025 2026, the department shall submit a report to the joint
14 standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over environment and natural
15 resources matters describing its findings or recommendations regarding the implementation
16 of the temporary waiver process under this subsection. The report may be included in the
17 report required pursuant to section 3115, subsection 3 that is required by February 15, 2025
18 2026. After reviewing the report, the committee may report out legislation relating to the
19 report.
20 Sec. 4. 38 MRSA §3106, sub-§5-A, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 482, §14, is amended
21 by amending the 3rd blocked paragraph to read:
22 This subsection is repealed January 1, 2026 2027.
23 Sec. 5. 38 MRSA §3106, sub-§6, as amended by PL 2023, c. 482, §15 and affected
24 by §43, is further amended to read:
25 6. Obligation to preserve container value. Notwithstanding subsection 8‑A, a
26 commingling group or its agent may refuse to accept, or pay the refund value and handling
27 costs to a dealer, redemption center or other person for, a beverage container that has been
28 processed by a reverse vending machine or account-based bulk processing program in a
29 way that has, for a nonrefillable beverage container, reduced the recycling value of the
30 container below current market value or, for a refillable beverage container, has damaged
31 the container in a manner that prevents its reuse. This subsection may not be interpreted to
32 prohibit a written processing agreement between a commingling group and a dealer or
33 redemption center and does not relieve a commingling group of its obligation under
34 subsection 8‑A to accept empty, unbroken and reasonably clean beverage containers.
35 Beginning July 15, 2025 2026, the cooperative, on behalf of its member commingling
36 groups, shall negotiate agreements with dealers and redemption centers regarding
37 processing payments for each beverage container material type. The department shall
38 adopt rules to establish the recycling value of beverage containers under this subsection
39 and the rules may authorize the use of a 3rd-party vendor to determine if a beverage
40 container has been processed by a reverse vending machine or account-based bulk
41 processing program in a manner that, for a nonrefillable beverage container, has reduced
42 the recycling value below current market value or, for a refillable beverage container, has
43 damaged the container in a manner that prevents its reuse. The rules must outline the
44 method of allocating among the parties involved the payment for 3rd-party vendor costs.

1 Sec. 6. 38 MRSA §3106, sub-§8-A, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 482, §17, is amended
2 to read:
3 8-A. Obligation to pick up and recycle containers. Beginning October 15, 2024, in
4 accordance with the requirements of this subsection and the rules adopted pursuant to this
5 subsection, a designated pick-up entity has the obligation to ensure the timely pickup and
6 recycling of all empty, unbroken and reasonably clean beverage containers subject to the
7 requirements of this chapter from dealers and redemption centers, including from any
8 locations where an account-based bulk processing program is in operation. As used in this
9 subsection, "designated pick-up entity" means, prior to July 15, 2025 2026, a commingling
10 group or its pick-up agent and, beginning July 15, 2025 2026, the cooperative or its pick-
11 up agent or agents.
12 A. Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection to the contrary, prior to July 15,
13 2025 2026, in the case of a designated pick-up entity that is a commingling group, the
14 commingling group's responsibilities under this subsection apply only to those
15 beverage containers from the initiators of deposit that are members of that
16 commingling group.
17 B. The department shall adopt rules to implement this subsection. The rules must, at
18 a minimum, establish pickup frequency standards based on the volume of beverage
19 containers collected by each dealer or redemption center, accounting for any
20 irregularities in volume, in a manner that promotes communication between designated
21 pick-up entities and dealers and redemption centers and that increases transportation
22 efficiency while maintaining the level of service provided to dealers and redemption
23 centers such that dealers and redemption centers are not required to store collected
24 beverage containers for extended periods of time without contact from and
25 compensation provided by the designated pick-up entity. Rules adopted pursuant to
26 this paragraph are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter
27 2‑A.
28 Sec. 7. 38 MRSA §3106, sub-§9, as amended by PL 2023, c. 482, §18, is further
29 amended to read:
30 9. Plastic bags. Plastic bags used by a dealer or redemption center and the cost
31 allocation of these bags must conform to rules adopted by the department concerning size

42 for redemption centers that manually sort containers, by size within each material
43 type. The program may facilitate the negotiation of agreements with redemption
44 centers to gather brand data through use of reverse vending machines, account-
Page 3 - 132LR2018(01)

415 based bulk processing programs or similar technology as long as the cost of such
