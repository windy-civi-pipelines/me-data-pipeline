14 SUMMARY
1155 Under current law, health insurance coverage must be provided for annual prostate
1166 cancer screening, if recommended by a physician, to men 50 years of age or older until
1177 attaining 72 years of age. This bill updates the required coverage by doing the following.
18 1. It expands the scope of the required screening services to include medically
19 necessary follow-up testing as directed by a physician, including, but not limited to, urinary
20 analysis; serum biomarker testing; and medical imaging. It retains the provision in current
21 law that requires coverage of a digital rectal examination and a prostate-specific antigen
22 test and provides that associated laboratory fees for those tests are also covered.
23 2. It requires the coverage of services for the early detection of prostate cancer, if
24 recommended by a physician, when supported by medical and scientific evidence
25 according to the most recently published nationally recognized clinical practice guideline.
26 3. It prohibits the use of any deductible, copayment, coinsurance or other cost-sharing
27 requirement for the costs of services for the early detection of prostate cancer.
28 The requirements of the bill apply to health plans issued or renewed on or after January
29 1, 2026.

14 SUMMARY
1155 Under current law, health insurance coverage must be provided for annual prostate
1166 cancer screening, if recommended by a physician, to men 50 years of age or older until
1177 attaining 72 years of age. This bill updates the required coverage by doing the following.
18 1. It expands the scope of the required screening services to include medically
19 necessary follow-up testing as directed by a physician, including, but not limited to, urinary
20 analysis; serum biomarker testing; and medical imaging. It retains the provision in current
21 law that requires coverage of a digital rectal examination and a prostate-specific antigen
22 test and provides that associated laboratory fees for those tests are also covered.
23 2. It requires the coverage of services for the early detection of prostate cancer, if
24 recommended by a physician, when supported by medical and scientific evidence
25 according to the most recently published nationally recognized clinical practice guideline.
26 3. It prohibits the use of any deductible, copayment, coinsurance or other cost-sharing
27 requirement for the costs of services for the early detection of prostate cancer.
28 The requirements of the bill apply to health plans issued or renewed on or after January
29 1, 2026.
