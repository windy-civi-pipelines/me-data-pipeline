5 SUMMARY
66 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, replaces the bill and
77 does the following:
8 1. It changes the definition of "capacity expansion project" to mean a transportation
9 project under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation or the Maine Turnpike
10 Authority that expands roadway capacity, including, but not limited to, the construction of
11 a new roadway, a roadway widening project or a project that establishes grade separation
12 at an intersection, excluding auxiliary lanes with a length of less than 2,500 feet;
13 2. It removes references to the transportation greenhouse gas emissions reductions
14 plan under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 23, section 4209-C and in Title 38, section
15 576-A, subsection 4-A throughout the bill in the impact assessment requirement;
16 3. It adds that the impact assessment must determine whether a capacity project results
17 in a neutral impact or net reduction in annual greenhouse gas emissions and per capita
18 vehicle miles traveled;
19 4. It removes some requirements in accordance with the climate action plan and target
20 requirements to be used in determining if a project may proceed and specifies that the
21 project may proceed if the Department of Transportation or the Maine Turnpike Authority
22 determines that the project does not increase annual greenhouse gas emissions or per capita
23 vehicle miles traveled;
24 5. It specifies that, if the Department of Transportation and the Maine Turnpike
25 Authority determine that a project increases annual greenhouse gas emissions or per capita
26 vehicle miles traveled, the Department of Transportation or the Maine Turnpike Authority
27 is required to alter the scope or design of the project to ensure a neutral impact or net
28 decrease in annual greenhouse gas emissions and per capita vehicle miles traveled;
29 6. It specifies that the determination of the Department of Transportation or the Maine
30 Turnpike Authority on whether to complete a new capacity project is based on whether the
31 project increases annual greenhouse gas emissions or per capita vehicle miles traveled,
32 rather than whether the project is consistent with the climate action plan's targets and limits;
33 7. It specifies that a sufficient mitigation measure is one in which the total greenhouse
34 gas emissions associated with the project result in a neutral impact or net reduction;
35 8. It removes the Transportation Climate Technical Committee and instead requires
36 the Department of Transportation and the Maine Turnpike Authority, by January 15, 2027
37 and biennially thereafter, to report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having
38 jurisdiction over transportation matters and the joint standing committee of the Legislature
39 having jurisdiction over environment and natural resources matters. The amendment also
40 requires at least 2 public meetings to be held on the report;
41 9. It removes the section that requires the Department of Transportation to develop
42 and, by July 1, 2026, publish a plan that, at a minimum, sets forth strategies for reduction

5 SUMMARY
66 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, replaces the bill and
77 does the following:
8 1. It changes the definition of "capacity expansion project" to mean a transportation
9 project under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation or the Maine Turnpike
10 Authority that expands roadway capacity, including, but not limited to, the construction of
11 a new roadway, a roadway widening project or a project that establishes grade separation
12 at an intersection, excluding auxiliary lanes with a length of less than 2,500 feet;
13 2. It removes references to the transportation greenhouse gas emissions reductions
14 plan under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 23, section 4209-C and in Title 38, section
15 576-A, subsection 4-A throughout the bill in the impact assessment requirement;
16 3. It adds that the impact assessment must determine whether a capacity project results
17 in a neutral impact or net reduction in annual greenhouse gas emissions and per capita
18 vehicle miles traveled;
19 4. It removes some requirements in accordance with the climate action plan and target
20 requirements to be used in determining if a project may proceed and specifies that the
21 project may proceed if the Department of Transportation or the Maine Turnpike Authority
22 determines that the project does not increase annual greenhouse gas emissions or per capita
23 vehicle miles traveled;
24 5. It specifies that, if the Department of Transportation and the Maine Turnpike
25 Authority determine that a project increases annual greenhouse gas emissions or per capita
26 vehicle miles traveled, the Department of Transportation or the Maine Turnpike Authority
27 is required to alter the scope or design of the project to ensure a neutral impact or net
28 decrease in annual greenhouse gas emissions and per capita vehicle miles traveled;
29 6. It specifies that the determination of the Department of Transportation or the Maine
30 Turnpike Authority on whether to complete a new capacity project is based on whether the
31 project increases annual greenhouse gas emissions or per capita vehicle miles traveled,
32 rather than whether the project is consistent with the climate action plan's targets and limits;
33 7. It specifies that a sufficient mitigation measure is one in which the total greenhouse
34 gas emissions associated with the project result in a neutral impact or net reduction;
35 8. It removes the Transportation Climate Technical Committee and instead requires
36 the Department of Transportation and the Maine Turnpike Authority, by January 15, 2027
37 and biennially thereafter, to report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having
38 jurisdiction over transportation matters and the joint standing committee of the Legislature
39 having jurisdiction over environment and natural resources matters. The amendment also
40 requires at least 2 public meetings to be held on the report;
41 9. It removes the section that requires the Department of Transportation to develop
42 and, by July 1, 2026, publish a plan that, at a minimum, sets forth strategies for reduction

413 of greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector necessary to achieve the
424 greenhouse gas emissions reductions and limits under Title 38, section 576-A and strategies
435 for reduction of statewide per capita vehicle miles traveled in accordance with the targets
446 identified in the climate action plan; and
5 10. It removes the section that requires the Department of Environmental Protection,
6 by December 31, 2025, to adopt rules establishing limits on greenhouse gas emissions from
7 the transportation sector.
