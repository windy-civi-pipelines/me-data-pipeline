19 B. A mitigation measure implemented with respect to a capacity expansion project by
20 the department or the authority, as applicable, is sufficient for the purposes of this
21 subsection if:
22 (1) The measure is specifically incorporated into the capacity expansion project
23 and the funding sources necessary for the implementation of the measure are
24 specifically identified in and committed to the project;
25 (2) The total greenhouse gas emissions associated with the project and net change
26 in vehicle miles traveled for the affected transportation network as a result of the
27 project, after accounting for emissions and vehicle miles traveled reductions
28 achieved through the incorporated mitigation measures, as determined by the
29 department or the authority, as applicable, is consistent with the transportation
30 greenhouse gas emissions reductions plan under section 4209-C, the
31 transportation-related targets in the climate action plan under Title 38, section 577

Page 6 - 132LR1886(01)
1 SUMMARY
22 This bill implements the following provisions designed to limit greenhouse gas
33 emissions from the transportation sector.
4 1. It amends the law regulating state monitoring of, reporting on and compliance with
5 the requirements for gross and net annual greenhouse gas emissions reductions levels to
6 require the Department of Transportation to adopt rules necessary to ensure compliance
7 with those reductions levels. Under current law, the Department of Transportation is
8 authorized but not required to adopt such rules.
9 2. It requires the Department of Environmental Protection, by December 31, 2025, to
10 adopt rules establishing greenhouse gas emissions limits specific to different source
11 categories within the transportation sector that are designed to be achieved through biennial
12 targets imposed over a 10-year period and to ensure compliance with established gross and
13 net annual greenhouse gas emissions levels and with the transportation-specific greenhouse
14 gas emissions reductions projections established in the climate action plan under the Maine
15 Revised Statutes, Title 38, section 577, subsection 5-A. The Department of Transportation
16 is required to adopt rules necessary to ensure compliance with those greenhouse gas
17 emissions limits established by the Department of Environmental Protection by rule.
18 3. It requires the Department of Transportation to develop and, by July 1, 2026, publish
19 a plan that, at a minimum, sets forth strategies for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
20 from the transportation sector necessary to achieve the greenhouse gas emissions
21 reductions and limits under Title 38, section 576-A and strategies for reduction of statewide
22 vehicle miles traveled in accordance with the targets identified in the climate action plan.
23 4. It provides that, beginning July 1, 2026, prior to inclusion of a capacity expansion
24 project in a Department of Transportation or Maine Turnpike Authority transportation
25 improvement program, work plan or long-range transportation plan, the department or the
26 authority, as applicable, must complete an impact assessment of the project. The bill
27 defines "capacity expansion project" as a transportation project that results in modifications
28 or other changes to a transportation facility and that is designed to improve vehicle travel
29 time or increase maximum throughput.
30 The impact assessment process is to be used by the department or the authority to
31 determine whether a capacity expansion project is consistent with the transportation
32 greenhouse gas emissions reductions plan under Title 23, section 4209-C, the
33 transportation-related targets in the climate action plan and the transportation sector
34 greenhouse gas emissions limits. The impact assessment must, at a minimum, include
35 projections for greenhouse gas emissions associated with the capacity expansion project
36 over a 20-year period, net change in vehicle miles traveled for the affected transportation
37 network as a result of the capacity expansion project and the direct impacts and induced
38 demand impacts of the capacity expansion project on vehicle miles traveled for the affected
39 transportation network as a result of the project.
40 If, through the impact assessment, the department or the authority determines that the
41 project is not consistent with the plan, targets and limits, the department or the authority
42 must alter the scope or design of the project to ensure greater consistency with the plan,
43 target or limits, incorporate sufficient mitigation measures into the project or halt project
44 development. The bill describes the types of mitigation measures that may be incorporated
Page 7 - 132LR1886(01)
415 into a capacity expansion project and sets forth the criteria for determining whether such
426 mitigation measures will be considered sufficient to allow the project to proceed.
3 5. It establishes the Transportation Climate Technical Committee to assist in the
4 development and review of the transportation greenhouse gas emissions reductions plan to
5 assist the Department of Transportation and the Maine Turnpike Authority in the
6 implementation of the requirements and processes for evaluating the greenhouse gas
7 emissions associated with capacity expansion projects under Title 23, section 710, and to
8 otherwise advise the Department of Transportation, the Maine Turnpike Authority and the
9 Legislature regarding achievement of the transportation sector targets identified in the
10 transportation greenhouse gas emissions reductions plan, the climate action plan and the
11 greenhouse gas emissions reductions levels and limits.

13 validation report for the models used, documentation of the model components and key
14 parameters and a description of how the models used account for induced travel
15 demand associated with transportation system changes.
16 B. Following completion of an impact assessment for a capacity expansion project in
17 accordance with the process established pursuant to paragraph A, the department or the
18 authority, as applicable, shall:
19 (1) Proceed with the project as proposed if, through the impact assessment, the
20 department or the authority determines that the project is consistent with the plan,
21 targets and limits identified in paragraph A; or
22 (2) If, through the impact assessment, the department or authority determines that
23 the project is not consistent with the plan, targets and limits identified in paragraph
24 A:
25 (a) Alter the scope or design of the project to ensure greater consistency with
26 the plan, target or limits and complete a new impact assessment for the
27 modified project;
28 (b) Incorporate sufficient mitigation measures into the project in accordance
29 with subsection 3; or
30 (c) Halt project development and ensure that the project is not included in a
31 transportation improvement program, work plan or long-range transportation
32 plan of the department or the authority, as applicable.
33 3. Mitigation measures. If the department or the authority completes an impact
34 assessment for a capacity expansion project in accordance with subsection 2 and, through
35 that assessment, determines that the project is not consistent with the plan, targets and limits
36 identified in subsection 2, paragraph A, the department or the authority may proceed with
37 the project through incorporation of sufficient mitigation measures in accordance with this
38 subsection.
39 A. For the purposes of this section, "mitigation measure" or "measure" means a project,
40 program or operations modification that involves one or more of the following
41 measures:
Page 2 - 132LR1886(01)

1 (1) Transit expansion, including, but not limited to, expansion of regular route bus
2 transit, arterial or highway bus rapid transit, rail transit or intercity passenger rail
3 transit;
4 (2) Transit service improvements, including, but not limited to, increased service
5 level, transit fare reduction or transit priority treatment;
6 (3) Expansion of active transportation infrastructure;

18 (9) Congestion pricing or tolling measures.
19 B. A mitigation measure implemented with respect to a capacity expansion project by
20 the department or the authority, as applicable, is sufficient for the purposes of this
21 subsection if:
22 (1) The measure is specifically incorporated into the capacity expansion project
23 and the funding sources necessary for the implementation of the measure are
24 specifically identified in and committed to the project;
25 (2) The total greenhouse gas emissions associated with the project and net change
26 in vehicle miles traveled for the affected transportation network as a result of the
27 project, after accounting for emissions and vehicle miles traveled reductions
28 achieved through the incorporated mitigation measures, as determined by the
29 department or the authority, as applicable, is consistent with the transportation
30 greenhouse gas emissions reductions plan under section 4209-C, the
31 transportation-related targets in the climate action plan under Title 38, section 577
32 and the transportation sector greenhouse gas emissions limits under Title 38,
33 section 576-A, subsection 4-A;
34 (3) The incorporated measure is localized in accordance with paragraph C; and
35 (4) The project includes provisions to ensure that the measures are implemented
36 in substantially the same form as incorporated or in a revised form that still allows
37 the project to satisfy the requirements of subparagraph (2).
38 C. A mitigation measure to be incorporated into a capacity expansion project is
39 considered localized if implemented based on the following order of priority:
40 (1) The measure must be implemented within or associated with at least one
41 community affected by the project;
Page 3 - 132LR1886(01)

1 (2) If there is no location that satisfies subparagraph (1), the measure must be
2 implemented within or associated with an underserved community in the State, as
3 determined by the department or the authority, as applicable, based on available
4 federal or state data;
5 (3) If there is no location that satisfies subparagraph (1) or (2), the measure must
6 be implemented within or associated with the metropolitan planning organization
7 region in which the project is located; and
8 (4) If there is no location that satisfies subparagraphs (1) to (3), the measure may
9 be implemented at any location in the State or on a statewide basis, as determined
10 by the department or the authority, as applicable. If the department or the authority
11 localizes a mitigation measure pursuant to this subparagraph, it shall publish on its
12 publicly accessible website an explanation regarding the feasibility of and rationale
13 for not incorporating a different mitigation measure described in paragraph A.
14 4. Publication of information. The department and the authority shall publish on
15 their respective publicly accessible websites all information regarding impact assessments
16 and mitigation measures conducted by each entity pursuant to this section, including, but
17 not limited to, information regarding the capacity expansion projects subject to the

Page 6 - 132LR1886(01)

1 SUMMARY
22 This bill implements the following provisions designed to limit greenhouse gas
33 emissions from the transportation sector.
4 1. It amends the law regulating state monitoring of, reporting on and compliance with
5 the requirements for gross and net annual greenhouse gas emissions reductions levels to
6 require the Department of Transportation to adopt rules necessary to ensure compliance
7 with those reductions levels. Under current law, the Department of Transportation is
8 authorized but not required to adopt such rules.
9 2. It requires the Department of Environmental Protection, by December 31, 2025, to
10 adopt rules establishing greenhouse gas emissions limits specific to different source
11 categories within the transportation sector that are designed to be achieved through biennial
12 targets imposed over a 10-year period and to ensure compliance with established gross and
13 net annual greenhouse gas emissions levels and with the transportation-specific greenhouse
14 gas emissions reductions projections established in the climate action plan under the Maine
15 Revised Statutes, Title 38, section 577, subsection 5-A. The Department of Transportation
16 is required to adopt rules necessary to ensure compliance with those greenhouse gas
17 emissions limits established by the Department of Environmental Protection by rule.
18 3. It requires the Department of Transportation to develop and, by July 1, 2026, publish
19 a plan that, at a minimum, sets forth strategies for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
20 from the transportation sector necessary to achieve the greenhouse gas emissions
21 reductions and limits under Title 38, section 576-A and strategies for reduction of statewide
22 vehicle miles traveled in accordance with the targets identified in the climate action plan.
23 4. It provides that, beginning July 1, 2026, prior to inclusion of a capacity expansion
24 project in a Department of Transportation or Maine Turnpike Authority transportation
25 improvement program, work plan or long-range transportation plan, the department or the
26 authority, as applicable, must complete an impact assessment of the project. The bill
27 defines "capacity expansion project" as a transportation project that results in modifications
28 or other changes to a transportation facility and that is designed to improve vehicle travel
29 time or increase maximum throughput.
30 The impact assessment process is to be used by the department or the authority to
31 determine whether a capacity expansion project is consistent with the transportation
32 greenhouse gas emissions reductions plan under Title 23, section 4209-C, the
33 transportation-related targets in the climate action plan and the transportation sector
34 greenhouse gas emissions limits. The impact assessment must, at a minimum, include
35 projections for greenhouse gas emissions associated with the capacity expansion project
36 over a 20-year period, net change in vehicle miles traveled for the affected transportation
37 network as a result of the capacity expansion project and the direct impacts and induced
38 demand impacts of the capacity expansion project on vehicle miles traveled for the affected
39 transportation network as a result of the project.
40 If, through the impact assessment, the department or the authority determines that the
41 project is not consistent with the plan, targets and limits, the department or the authority
42 must alter the scope or design of the project to ensure greater consistency with the plan,
43 target or limits, incorporate sufficient mitigation measures into the project or halt project
44 development. The bill describes the types of mitigation measures that may be incorporated
Page 7 - 132LR1886(01)

415 into a capacity expansion project and sets forth the criteria for determining whether such
426 mitigation measures will be considered sufficient to allow the project to proceed.
3 5. It establishes the Transportation Climate Technical Committee to assist in the
4 development and review of the transportation greenhouse gas emissions reductions plan to
5 assist the Department of Transportation and the Maine Turnpike Authority in the
6 implementation of the requirements and processes for evaluating the greenhouse gas
7 emissions associated with capacity expansion projects under Title 23, section 710, and to
8 otherwise advise the Department of Transportation, the Maine Turnpike Authority and the
9 Legislature regarding achievement of the transportation sector targets identified in the
10 transportation greenhouse gas emissions reductions plan, the climate action plan and the
11 greenhouse gas emissions reductions levels and limits.
