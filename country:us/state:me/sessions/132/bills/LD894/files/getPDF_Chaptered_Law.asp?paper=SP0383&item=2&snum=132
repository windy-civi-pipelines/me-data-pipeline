27 1. It requires an employee to be employed with an employer for 120 days before being

30 be taken unless it is agreed to by the employee and the employer.
31 3. It provides examples of what type of conditions constitute undue hardship for an
32 employer and allows an employer to determine other conditions, based on that employer's
33 specific business, that constitute undue hardship. It also provides that the decision of an
34 employer to deny the requested scheduling of leave based on the examples provided is not
35 reviewable by the Department of Labor. It clarifies that a decision of an employer to deny
36 the scheduling of leave based on undue hardship for any condition other than the examples
37 is reviewable by the department.

1 6. It establishes in statute the Bureau of Paid Family and Medical Leave within the
2 Department of Labor to administer the paid family and medical leave benefits program.
3 7. It requires an employee to file an application for family leave benefits no more than
4 15 days after the start of family leave and to file an application for medical leave benefits
5 no more than 30 days after the start of the medical leave.
6 8. It provides that it is the obligation of the employee to pay premiums unless the
7 employer chooses to deduct premiums from the employee's wages.
8 9. It changes the applications of penalties against employers from mandatory to
9 discretionary.
10 10. It establishes remedies for the Department of Labor to enforce the collection of
11 delinquent premium contributions, penalties and assessments on employers that fail to
12 make payments required by the program.
13 11. It establishes liability for individuals or organizations with respect to premium
14 contributions, penalties and assessments owed by employers acquired by those individuals
15 or organizations.
16 12. It establishes penalties for employers that allow private plan benefit coverage to
17 lapse during a period of an approved private plan substitution.
18 13. It allows an employer whose private plan is approved by the Department of Labor
19 to request a refund of the premiums paid if that employer had a substantially equivalent
20 private plan in place before January 1, 2026. The department, after verifying the amount
21 paid by the employer, is required, within 30 days of receipt of the refund request, to refund
22 the employer the premiums paid, plus interest that accrues to the date the refund payment
23 is issued. It requires the employer to reimburse any employee from whom a premium was
24 collected and submitted to the department.
25 14. It establishes that the Department of Labor must determine approval of a private
26 plan within 30 days of receipt of an application and requires the department to update its
27 rules.
28 15. It clarifies that the provision that provides that an employee who takes leave is
29 entitled to be restored to the employee's former position does not apply to an employee who
30 is taking retroactive paid leave and who did not notify the employer for more than 10 days
31 of the employee's absence.
32 16. It provides that benefits paid from the program are subject to state income tax to
33 the extent those benefits are not included in the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income.
34 It also provides that a taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income may be reduced by the
35 amount subject to repayment that has been previously taxed by the State. It also allows
36 individuals filing a new claim for family leave benefits or medical leave benefits to elect
37 to have the administrator of the program deduct and withhold state income tax from the
38 individual's payment of benefits at the rate of 5% and requires the administrator of the
39 program to deduct and withhold state income tax. It also requires the department to advise
40 individuals filing a new claim for benefits that the benefits are subject to state income tax.
41 17. It places limits on the fees charged for private plan substitutions.
