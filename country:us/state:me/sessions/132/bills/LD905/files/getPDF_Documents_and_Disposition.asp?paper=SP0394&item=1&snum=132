29 SUMMARY
3300 This bill changes the mechanism by which a transmission and distribution utility is
3311 required to remit the value of unused kilowatt-hour credits that were accumulated and that
3322 expired during the prior calendar year by requiring the utility to remit the value to the
3333 administrators of the statewide low-income assistance plan and the individual low-income
3344 assistance programs instead of the Public Utilities Commission. It also changes the date for
3355 remittance from January 1st to April 1st and requires that the commission, by rule, adopt
3366 provisions regarding the manner by which the transmission and distribution utility must
3377 report to the commission information regarding the number of unused kilowatt-hour credits
3388 that were accumulated by all customers of the utility with net energy billing arrangements
3399 during the prior calendar year and that expired during the prior calendar year and the
4400 monetary value of those credits.
