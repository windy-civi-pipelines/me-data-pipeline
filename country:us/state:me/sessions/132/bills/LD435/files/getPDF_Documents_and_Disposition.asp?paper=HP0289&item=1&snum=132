34 SUMMARY
3355 Part A of this bill makes changes to modernize the existing small project provisions of
3366 the historic property rehabilitation tax credit, including increasing the eligible percentage
3377 of the project from 25% to 30% and increasing the expenditure cap from $250,000 to

3399 housing creation to 35% for significant projects and 45% for small projects.
Page 6 - 132LR0369(01)

1 Part A also establishes a certification process for the rehabilitation and weatherization
2 of existing homes and creates an income tax credit for rehabilitation and weatherization of
3 certified historic homes equal to 25% of the qualified exterior rehabilitation expenditures
4 for a qualified taxpayer whose federally adjusted gross income does not exceed $120,000.
5 The percentage of credit that may be claimed increases to 30% if housing is created as part
6 of the weatherization and rehabilitation efforts. This Part also adds the credit for
7 rehabilitation and weatherization of historic homes to the report that the Maine Historic
8 Preservation Commission provides to the Legislature and requires the report to be provided
9 every 5 years instead of biennially.
10 Part B of this bill changes the maximum tax credit allowed for certified historic
11 structure rehabilitation projects for the first 2 years in which a credit may be claimed. It
12 changes the maximum from $5,000,000 in each of the first 2 years to $10,000,000 total
13 across the first 2 years combined. It makes no changes to the $5,000,000 maximum tax
14 credit allowed in subsequent years. This change applies to tax years beginning on or after
15 January 1, 2025. This Part also eliminates the requirement that eligible projects be certified
16 on or before December 31, 2030.
