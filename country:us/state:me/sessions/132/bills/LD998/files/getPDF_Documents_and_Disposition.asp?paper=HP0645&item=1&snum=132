1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 26 MRSA ยง600, sub-ยง1, as amended by PL 2011, c. 537, ยง1, is further
3 amended to read:
4 1. Firearms in vehicles. An employer or an agent of an employer may not prohibit
5 an employee who has a valid permit to carry a concealed firearm under Title 25, chapter
6 252 from keeping a firearm in the employee's vehicle as long as the vehicle is locked and
7 the firearm is not visible. This subsection applies to the State as an employer when a state
8 employee's vehicle is on property owned or leased by the State. This subsection does not
9 authorize an employee or state employee to carry a firearm in a place where carrying a
10 firearm is prohibited by law. For purposes of this section, "state employee" means an
11 employee of the State within the executive branch, the legislative branch or the judicial
12 branch performing services within the scope of that employee's employment.
13 SUMMARY
1144 This bill modifies the provision of law governing an employer's authority to prohibit
1155 an employee from storing a firearm in the employee's vehicle. The current law states that
1166 an employer is not permitted to prohibit an employee from storing a firearm in the
1177 employee's vehicle if the employee has a valid permit to carry a concealed firearm under
1188 the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 25, chapter 252, as long as the vehicle is locked and the
1199 firearm is stored out of sight. The bill removes the specification that the employee must
2200 have a valid permit to carry a concealed firearm.
