13 supervision of the Secretary of State, who shall allow the candidate's representatives or
14 counsel to recount the ballots. The candidate may not act as a counter of ballots.
15 Sec. 3. 30-A MRSA §2528, sub-§10, as amended by PL 2021, c. 564, §1, is further

19 Election must be by plurality vote. In the case of a tie vote, the municipal clerk shall
20 automatically initiate a recount. If a recount confirms a tie vote, the meeting must be
21 adjourned to a day certain, when ballots are again cast for the candidates tied for the office
22 in question, unless all but one tied candidate withdraw from a subsequent election by
23 delivering written notice of withdrawal signed by the candidate and notarized to the
24 municipal offices within the 7-day period following the election. After the 7-day period
25 has expired, the municipal officers shall call a run-off election between the remaining
26 candidates by posting a warrant in the manner required for calling a town meeting. If only
27 one candidate remains, that candidate is declared the winner and sworn into office.
28 If the meeting is adjourned sine die before a tie vote is resolved or the tie vote is discovered
29 after the meeting adjourns sine die and more than one candidate remains, a new meeting
30 must be called to conduct a run-off election by the method described in this subsection.
