15 SUMMARY
1166 This amendment replaces the term "declared winner" with the term "apparent winner"
1177 to identify a candidate who is not eligible to request a recount.
1188 The preliminary fiscal impact statement identified a potential unfunded state mandate
1199 in the requirements that municipal clerks automatically initiate recounts in the case of tie
2200 votes when secret ballots are used for elections of town officials or for municipal referenda
2211 elections at town meetings.
2222 The committee reviewed the preliminary fiscal impact statement and determined that
2233 because the likelihood of tie votes occurring in municipalities where secret ballots are used
2244 for elections of town officials or for municipal referenda elections at town meetings would
2255 be so infrequent the requirement likely will not have significant costs and does not require
2266 an expansion or modification of activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures.
2277 Additionally, organizations representing municipal interests expressed support for the bill,
2288 noting that it streamlined the process, and indicated that the bill's changes may be able to,
2299 in certain situations, save municipalities costs associated with having to conduct a run-off
3300 election.
