1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 24-A MRSA §4347, sub-§20 is enacted to read:
3 20. 340B drug pricing. "340B drug pricing" means the program established under
4 Section 602 of the federal Veterans Health Care Act of 1992.
5 Sec. 2. 24-A MRSA §4347, sub-§21 is enacted to read:
6 21. Wholesale acquisition cost. "Wholesale acquisition cost" has the same meaning
7 as in Title 22, section 8731, subsection 6.
8 Sec. 3. 24-A MRSA §4349-A is enacted to read:
9 §4349-A. Discriminatory practices prohibited
10 1. Discriminatory practices of carrier or pharmacy benefits manager regarding
11 340B drug pricing. A carrier, or a pharmacy benefits manager under contract with a
12 carrier, may not discriminate against an entity authorized to participate in 340B drug
13 pricing or a pharmacy provider under contract with an entity authorized to participate in
14 340B drug pricing by:
15 A. Preventing or interfering with a covered person's choice to use without penalty any
16 pharmacy provider that the covered person chooses, whether or not the pharmacy
17 provider participates in 340B drug pricing;
18 B. Placing additional requirements, restrictions or unnecessary burdens upon an entity
19 authorized to participate in 340B drug pricing or a pharmacy under contract with an
20 entity authorized to participate in 340B drug pricing that results in administrative costs
21 or fees to the entity or pharmacy that are not placed on other entities or pharmacies that
22 do not participate in 340B drug pricing, including pharmacies affiliated with the
23 pharmacy benefits manager; or
24 C. Requiring a billing claim to indicate that the claim is a 340B drug pricing claim
25 unless the claim is being billed under the Medicaid program on a fee-for-service basis.
26 2. Discriminatory practices of carrier or pharmacy benefits manager regarding
27 reimbursement. A carrier, or a pharmacy benefits manager under contract with a carrier,
28 may not reimburse a pharmacy provider for a prescription drug or pharmacy service in an
29 amount that is less than the national average drug acquisition cost for the prescription drug
30 or pharmacy service at the time the drug is administered or dispensed, plus the amount of
31 a dispensing fee that is not less than the dispensing fee paid under the Medicaid program
32 on a fee-for-service basis. If the national average drug acquisition cost for the prescription
33 drug or pharmacy service is not available at the time the drug is administered or dispensed,
34 a carrier, or a pharmacy benefits manager under contract with a carrier, may not reimburse
35 a pharmacy provider for that prescription drug or pharmacy service in an amount that is
36 less than the wholesale acquisition cost of the drug, plus the amount of a dispensing fee
37 that is not less than the dispensing fee paid under the Medicaid program on a fee-for-service
38 basis. Notwithstanding this subsection, a carrier, or a pharmacy benefits manager under
39 contract with a carrier, may not reimburse a pharmacy provider for a prescription drug or
40 pharmacy service in an amount that is less than the amount the pharmacy benefits manager
41 reimburses itself or an affiliate for the same prescription drug or pharmacy service.

1 3. Violation. The superintendent may order a carrier, or a pharmacy benefits manager
2 under contract with a carrier, to reimburse a covered person or pharmacy provider that has
3 incurred a monetary loss as a result of a violation of this section.
4 SUMMARY
55 This bill prohibits a health insurance carrier, or a pharmacy benefits manager under
66 contract with a carrier, from engaging in certain discriminatory practices against an entity
77 authorized to participate in the federal 340B drug pricing program or a pharmacy provider
88 under contract with an entity authorized to participate in the federal 340B drug pricing
99 program. The federal 340B drug pricing program within the United States Department of
1100 Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration allows eligible
1111 entities to purchase discounted prescription drugs.
12 The bill also prohibits a health insurance carrier, or a pharmacy benefits manager under
13 contract with a carrier, from reimbursing a pharmacy provider for a prescription drug or
14 pharmacy service in an amount that is less than the national average drug acquisition cost
15 at the time the drug is administered or dispensed. The bill also specifies that the
16 reimbursement amount may not be less than the amount the pharmacy benefits manager
17 reimburses itself or an affiliate for the same prescription drug or pharmacy service.
