§1864. Emergency authority to regulate surface use
The commissioner and the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife may jointly

The order may require that watercraft on using waters affected by the order be taken out of
or launched on the water only at locations identified in the order. The order may require
inspections and cleaning of watercraft, watercraft trailers and equipment upon removal at
sites that have been identified in the order. Inspections must be conducted by designated
