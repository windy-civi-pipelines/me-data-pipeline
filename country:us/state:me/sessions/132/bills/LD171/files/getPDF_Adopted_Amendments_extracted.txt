315 or the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife as a person who is qualified to properly
326 conduct inspection activities.'
3 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section
4 number to read consecutively.
5 SUMMARY
66 This amendment authorizes the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife and the
77 Commissioner of Environmental Protection to issue an order on a water body with a
88 confirmed infestation of an invasive aquatic animal; current law only allows the
99 commissioners to issue an order on a water body with a confirmed infestation of an invasive
1100 aquatic plant. The order may also require that watercraft be launched only at locations
1111 identified in a surface use restriction order. The amendment also removes, in cases when
1122 a surface use restriction order requires inspections, the requirement that inspections be
1133 conducted by a state employee; instead inspections may be conducted by a state-trained
1144 inspector. These changes were recommended by the Interagency Task Force on Invasive
1155 Aquatic Plants and Nuisance Species in the task force's January 2025 report.
16 The amendment also requires the Commissioner of Environmental Protection and the
17 Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to report annually to the joint standing
18 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over inland fisheries and wildlife matters
19 on activities of the program to prevent infestation of and to control invasive aquatic plants.
