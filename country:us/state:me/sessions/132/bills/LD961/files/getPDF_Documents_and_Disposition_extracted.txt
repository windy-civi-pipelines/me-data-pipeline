1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, Maine faces a growing crisis in meeting the physical and mental health care
4 needs of its residents due in part to the urgent shortage of health care professionals qualified
5 to meet those needs; and
6 Whereas, certified nurse practitioners are highly qualified to provide such care and
7 are uniquely positioned to assist patients; and
8 Whereas, Maine recognizes 4 categories of nurses that may qualify to provide
9 advanced practice registered nursing, but only certified nurse practitioners are subject to a
10 2-year supervision requirement; and
11 Whereas, that supervision requirement prevents needed, highly qualified advanced
12 practice registered nurses from practicing in Maine; and
13 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
14 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
15 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
16 therefore,
17 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
18 Sec. 1. 32 MRSA §2102, sub-§2-A, as amended by PL 2007, c. 316, §1, is further
19 amended by repealing the 2nd blocked paragraph.

21 Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation
22 takes effect when approved.
23 SUMMARY
2244 This bill repeals the provision of law requiring that a certified nurse practitioner who
2255 qualifies as an advanced practice registered nurse must practice for at least 24 months under
2266 the supervision of a physician or supervising nurse practitioner or be employed by a clinic
2277 or hospital that has a medical director who is a licensed physician. The bill also eliminates
2288 the supervising nurse practitioner designation, which is no longer needed.
