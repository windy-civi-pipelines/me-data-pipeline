Page 1 - 132LR0628(04)

to this section and for other equitable relief as the nature of the case and the interest of
the insurer’s policyholders, creditors and shareholders or the public may require.
(1) If the superintendent finds probable cause that a violation of this section
constitutes grounds provided for the rehabilitation, conservatorship or liquidation
of an insurer, the superintendent may initiate a delinquency proceeding under
chapter 57.
(2) The Superior Court may, on the application of an insurer or the superintendent:
(a) Enjoin any offer, request, invitation, agreement or acquisition made in

vote of a percentage of shares may be taken as though the securities were not issued and
