26 multidisciplinary supports, services and requirements, to have all or most of their pending
27 criminal charges dismissed. The Office of Behavioral Health shall invite a
28 multidisciplinary group of stakeholders to participate in the working group, including
29 probation and parole officers from the Department of Corrections, as well as
