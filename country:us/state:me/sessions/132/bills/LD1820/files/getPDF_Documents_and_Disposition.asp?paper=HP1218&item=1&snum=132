3300 eliminating cannabis purchase limits, eliminating certain requirements regarding the
3311 inspection of licensed premises and eliminating certain cannabis and cannabis product

3333 transactions, including allowing licensees to use the tracking system established by the
3344 Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Office of Cannabis Policy to track
3355 delivery transactions and sales at specified events. The bill prohibits the Office of Cannabis
3366 Policy from requiring licensees to sign forms that require the licensees to waive certain
3377 rights protected under constitutional, statutory or common law privilege. The bill also
3388 clarifies excise tax laws as they apply to cannabis biomass.
