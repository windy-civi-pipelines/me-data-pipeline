1188 investigation finds an unhealthy level of nonsurface mold, remediation efforts must be
1199 initiated by the landlord within 5 business days of the investigation. The bill requires a local
2200 health officer to investigate a dwelling unit to determine if all surface mold has been
2211 remediated. Finally, the bill provides that a tenant may file a complaint under the implied
2222 warranty and covenant of habitability laws if the landlord fails to remediate the nonsurface
2233 mold within 60 days of the report.
