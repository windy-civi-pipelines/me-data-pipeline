of Hydroelectric Power and the Development of a Geothermal Power Plant in
the State
Sec. 1. Governor's Energy Office to conduct studies. Resolved: That the
Governor's Energy Office, referred to in this resolve as "the office," shall conduct studies
as directed by this resolve in consultation with the Public Utilities Commission, the
Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Defense, Veterans and
Emergency Management, Maine Emergency Management Agency to support the
development of a balanced portfolio of energy sources in the State.
Sec. 2. Study; hydroelectric power facilities and energy storage. Resolved:
That the office shall conduct a study reviewing the current operation of and opportunities
for the expansion of hydroelectric power and energy storage in the State for the purpose of
evaluating methods to revitalize the hydroelectric power industry while taking into
consideration the greenhouse gas emissions associated with such generation and storage.
In conducting this study, the office shall:

Section 2:
1. Review the findings of any previous studies of hydroelectric power facilities in the
State, including, but not limited to, the February 2015 report prepared for the office and
titled "Maine Hydropower Study," to identify dam sites within the State that have the
greatest potential to be efficiently expanded or upgraded;

Section 3:
2. Review new technologies being used in hydroelectric power facilities in other states
and evaluate whether those technologies could be used in this State to improve or expand
the hydroelectric power industry through the expansion or upgrading of the dam sites
identified under subsection 1. In carrying out this review, the office shall consult with at
least one hydroelectric power facility in Alaska and at least one hydroelectric power facility
in each of 2 other states that the office determines has similar geographic and topographical
characteristics to Maine; and

Section 4:
3. Identify locations within the State that may be suitable for the development of
pumped storage hydropower systems because of geographic, technical and economic
factors and evaluate the existing barriers to establishing such hydroelectric energy storage
systems.

Sec. 3. Study; geothermal systems. Resolved: That the office shall conduct a
study for the purpose of evaluating the potential for the development of a geothermal power
plant or other geothermal power plant generation system or space heating and cooling
system in this State based on an assessment of geographic, technical and economic factors.
For the purposes of this resolve, "geothermal power plant" means a power plant that uses
heat from the earth to generate electricity or thermal energy for heating or cooling. The
study must summarize research and analysis of opportunities for the development of
geothermal systems in the State while taking into consideration the greenhouse gas
emissions associated with such systems. The office is not required to include specific cost
data or a technical economic assessment of individual sites in the study. In conducting this
study, the office shall:

Section 5:
1. Consult with persons with expertise in the geologic engineering field, including
persons employed by State Government or Federal Government, regarding the feasibility
of establishing a geothermal power plant in the State. Using the existing resources of the
office, the office may seek a formal opinion or report from such persons. If the office
concludes, as a result of the office's consultation, that a geothermal power plant could be
developed in the State in a cost-effective way, as determined by the office, the office shall
develop recommendations for the development of a geothermal power plant in the State;
and

Section 6:
2. Assess the potential for developing district geothermal systems:
A. On brownfield sites in the State, as determined by the office in consultation with the
Department of Environmental Protection; and
B. At state-owned facilities or on state-owned properties.
Sec. 4. Reports. Resolved: That, no later than January 15, 2027, the office shall
submit a report based on each study under this resolve, including any recommendations, to
the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy matters.
The joint standing committee may report out legislation related to the reports to the 133rd
Legislature in 2027.
