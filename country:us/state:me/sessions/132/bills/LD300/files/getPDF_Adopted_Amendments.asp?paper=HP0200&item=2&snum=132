10 Public Utilities Commission to Study Expanding the Use of Hydroelectric Power and the
11 Development of a Geothermal Power Plant in the State”
12 Amend the resolve by striking out the title and substituting the following:
13 'Resolve, to Direct the Governor's Energy Office to Study Expanding the Use of
14 Hydroelectric Power and the Development of a Geothermal Power Plant in the State'
15 Amend the resolve by striking out everything after the title and inserting the following:
16 'Sec. 1. Governor's Energy Office to conduct studies. Resolved: That the
17 Governor's Energy Office, referred to in this resolve as "the office," shall conduct studies
18 as directed by this resolve in consultation with the Public Utilities Commission, the
19 Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Defense, Veterans and
20 Emergency Management, Maine Emergency Management Agency to support the
21 development of a balanced portfolio of energy sources in the State.
22 Sec. 2. Study; hydroelectric power facilities and energy storage. Resolved:
23 That the office shall conduct a study reviewing the current operation of and opportunities
24 for the expansion of hydroelectric power and energy storage in the State for the purpose of
25 evaluating methods to revitalize the hydroelectric power industry while taking into
26 consideration the greenhouse gas emissions associated with such generation and storage.
27 In conducting this study, the office shall:
28 1. Review the findings of any previous studies of hydroelectric power facilities in the
29 State, including, but not limited to, the February 2015 report prepared for the office and
30 titled "Maine Hydropower Study," to identify dam sites within the State that have the
31 greatest potential to be efficiently expanded or upgraded;
32 2. Review new technologies being used in hydroelectric power facilities in other states
33 and evaluate whether those technologies could be used in this State to improve or expand
34 the hydroelectric power industry through the expansion or upgrading of the dam sites
35 identified under subsection 1. In carrying out this review, the office shall consult with at

316 least one hydroelectric power facility in Alaska and at least one hydroelectric power facility
327 in each of 2 other states that the office determines has similar geographic and topographical
338 characteristics to Maine; and
4 3. Identify locations within the State that may be suitable for the development of
5 pumped storage hydropower systems because of geographic, technical and economic
6 factors and evaluate the existing barriers to establishing such hydroelectric energy storage
7 systems.
8 Sec. 3. Study; geothermal systems. Resolved: That the office shall conduct a
9 study for the purpose of evaluating the potential for the development of a geothermal power
10 plant or other geothermal power plant generation system or space heating and cooling
11 system in this State based on an assessment of geographic, technical and economic factors.
12 For the purposes of this resolve, "geothermal power plant" means a power plant that uses
13 heat from the earth to generate electricity or thermal energy for heating or cooling. The
14 study must summarize research and analysis of opportunities for the development of
15 geothermal systems in the State while taking into consideration the greenhouse gas
16 emissions associated with such systems. The office is not required to include specific cost
17 data or a technical economic assessment of individual sites in the study. In conducting this
18 study, the office shall:
19 1. Consult with persons with expertise in the geologic engineering field, including
20 persons employed by State Government or Federal Government, regarding the feasibility
21 of establishing a geothermal power plant in the State. Using the existing resources of the
22 office, the office may seek a formal opinion or report from such persons. If the office
23 concludes, as a result of the office's consultation, that a geothermal power plant could be
24 developed in the State in a cost-effective way, as determined by the office, the office shall
25 develop recommendations for the development of a geothermal power plant in the State;
26 and
27 2. Assess the potential for developing district geothermal systems:
28 A. On brownfield sites in the State, as determined by the office in consultation with the
29 Department of Environmental Protection; and
30 B. At state-owned facilities or on state-owned properties.
31 Sec. 4. Reports. Resolved: That, no later than January 15, 2027, the office shall
32 submit a report based on each study under this resolve, including any recommendations, to
33 the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy matters.
34 The joint standing committee may report out legislation related to the reports to the 133rd
35 Legislature in 2027.'
36 Amend the resolve by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or
37 section number to read consecutively.
38 SUMMARY
