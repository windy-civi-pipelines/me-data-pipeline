1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 17-A MRSA ยง1613 is enacted to read:
3 ยง1613. Sentencing alternatives for primary caregivers
4 1. Definitions. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the
5 following terms have the following meanings.
6 A. "Dependent" has the same meaning as in Title 33, section 1021, subsection 1.
7 B. "Elderly" means that an individual is 60 years of age or older.
8 C. "Physical or mental disability" has the same meaning as in Title 5, section 4553-A,
9 subsection 1.
10 D. "Primary caregiver" means an individual who has the greatest responsibility for the
11 care of a minor, an elderly dependent person or an individual with a physical or mental
12 disability.
13 2. Motion for sentencing alternative. Upon a conviction of an offense that may
14 result in a sentence of imprisonment, unless the offense requires a sentence of
15 imprisonment, the court may issue a sentencing alternative under section 1502, subsection
16 2 due to the defendant's being a primary caregiver. The court shall consider the defendant's
17 status as a primary caregiver if, no more than 10 days after the entry of judgment, the
18 defendant makes a motion for a sentencing alternative. A motion for a sentencing
19 alternative under this subsection must be supported by an affidavit by the defendant
20 detailing the basis for the assertion that the defendant is a primary caregiver under this
21 section.
22 3. Findings. Upon receipt of a motion for a sentencing alternative under subsection
23 2, the court shall consider the defendant's status as a primary caregiver and make written
24 findings of the court's decision prior to issuing the sentence. In making the decision under
25 this subsection, the court shall consider:
26 A. The nature and circumstances of the offense committed;
27 B. The history and character of the defendant;
28 C. The defendant's family circumstances and relationships; and
29 D. The impact of any sentence on every individual for whom the defendant is the
30 primary caregiver.
31 SUMMARY
3322 This bill requires a court in sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense that may
3333 result in a term of imprisonment, upon motion of the defendant and supported by an
3344 affidavit, to consider a sentencing alternative other than imprisonment due to the
3355 defendant's being a primary caregiver of a minor, elderly dependent or individual with a
3366 physical or mental disability. In making the decision, the court is required to consider
3377 factors such as the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and character of the
3388 defendant, the defendant's family circumstances and relationships and the impact of any
3399 sentence considered on every individual for whom the defendant is the primary caregiver.
