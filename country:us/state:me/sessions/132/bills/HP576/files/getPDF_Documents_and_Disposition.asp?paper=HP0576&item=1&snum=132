JOINT RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING MARCH 6, 2025 AS BLACK
BALLOON DAY
WHEREAS, substance use disorder and the overdose crisis continue to devastate
communities across Maine, resulting in the tragic loss of 490 lives in 2024 alone, leaving
families, friends and communities in mourning; and
WHEREAS, Black Balloon Day, observed annually on March 6th, serves as an
international day of remembrance to honor those lost to overdose and to acknowledge the
profound impact of substance use disorder on individuals, families and society; and
WHEREAS, each life lost represents a parent, child, sibling, friend or neighbor whose full
potential was never realized because of the disease of addiction; and
WHEREAS, the overdose crisis affects people of all backgrounds and communities, and
there is an urgent need for increased awareness, prevention, treatment, harm reduction and
recovery support services; and
WHEREAS, stigma remains a significant barrier to seeking and receiving care, and it is
our collective responsibility to foster compassion, understanding and evidence-based
approaches to substance use disorder; and
WHEREAS, families and advocates throughout Maine continue to share their stories, fight
for better policies and work to ensure that no more lives are lost to preventable overdoses; and
WHEREAS, Black Balloon Day provides an opportunity for individuals and organizations
to come together in remembrance and in solidarity, encouraging conversation and action to
address this ongoing public health crisis; and
WHEREAS, the Legislature recognizes the urgency of addressing the overdose epidemic
through continued policy efforts, funding for prevention and treatment programs and
community-driven solutions; now, therefore, be it
RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Thirty-second Legislature
now assembled in the First Regular Session, pause in our deliberations to recognize Black
Balloon Day, honor the 490 lives lost to overdose in Maine in 2024 and extend our deepest
sympathies to the families and loved ones affected by this crisis; and be it further
RESOLVED: That we reaffirm our commitment to addressing substance use disorder and
supporting those in recovery with compassion, urgency and dedication.
