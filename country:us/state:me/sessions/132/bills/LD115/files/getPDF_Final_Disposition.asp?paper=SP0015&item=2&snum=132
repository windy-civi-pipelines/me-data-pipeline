24 SUMMARY
2255 This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, incorporates a fiscal
2266 note. The fiscal note states that, to the extent that the collection of impact fees requires a
2277 local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional
2288 expenditures from local revenue, expenditure of local revenue may be required, and, as a
2299 result, the fiscal note flags the legislation as a potential mandate. The committee reviewed
3300 the fiscal note, and the minority of the committee determined that the requirements of the
3311 legislation do not amount to a mandate. Many municipalities already collect docking fees

3333 collect the impact fees. In addition, 50% of the impact fee is proposed to be distributed to
3344 municipalities to support harbor and sea level rise mitigation infrastructure and 50% to

315 support public transit infrastructure, and this can be used to offset any cost to municipalities
326 of implementing the impact fees. As such, the minority of the committee believes that this
337 requirement does not mandate a municipality to do anything it cannot already do within
348 existing resources.
359 This amendment provides baseline allocations to establish the Megayacht Fund.
