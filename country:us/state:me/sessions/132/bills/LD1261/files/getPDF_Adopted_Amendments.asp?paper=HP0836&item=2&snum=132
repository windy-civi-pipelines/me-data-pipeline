8 screened-out families that would likely benefit from community services for support to
9 prevent the need for intervention by child protective services in the future. Those
10 community services may include, but are not limited to, physical and mental health care,
11 housing assistance, food access assistance, fuel assistance, child care, transportation,
12 employment training and substance use disorder treatment.

32 SUMMARY
3333 This amendment replaces the bill with a resolve. Like the bill, it establishes a 2-year
3344 pilot program requiring the Department of Health and Human Services to contract with
3355 child abuse and neglect prevention councils for community navigators to provide support
3366 to families in need and provide guidance to mandated reporters of suspected child abuse or
3377 neglect. The amendment changes the number of contracts for community navigators in the
3388 pilot program from 4 to 2 and requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
3399 contract with one child abuse and neglect prevention council in the northern part of the
4400 State and one in the southern part of the State. The amendment clarifies that the contracts
4411 between the department and the councils must include mechanisms for identifying families
4422 in need of community services and for sharing information between community navigators
