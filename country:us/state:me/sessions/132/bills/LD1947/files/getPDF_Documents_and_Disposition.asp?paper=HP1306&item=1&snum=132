10 2. Optional methods of payment. In lieu of payment under subsection 1, a qualifying
11 member may elect to receive a regular retirement allowance under one of the options set
12 out in this subsection. The optional allowance is a reduced allowance computed actuarially
13 on the basis of the option selected.
14 The qualifying member may elect one of the options by written request to and approval of
15 the executive director prior to the commencement of payment of a regular retirement
16 allowance. The election may be revoked by written notice to the executive director at any
17 time before the regular retirement allowance commences.
18 For the purposes of this subsection, "qualifying member" means a member or a former
19 member who has been receiving a disability retirement benefit and changes to service
20 retirement under section 1353, subsection 7.
21 A. Under Option 1, the qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement
22 benefit paid to the qualifying member while alive and at the qualifying member's death
23 to have the excess, if any, of the qualifying member's accumulated contributions at the
24 time of retirement over the portion of the total retirement benefit payments actually
25 made to the qualifying member while alive, which is the actuarial equivalent of the
26 accumulated contributions, paid in a lump sum to the beneficiary that the qualifying
27 member has nominated by written designation duly notarized acknowledged and filed
28 with the chief executive director officer on a form provided or specified by the Maine
29 Public Employees Retirement System or, if no one has been nominated as beneficiary,
30 to the qualifying member's estate.
31 B. Under Option 2, the qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement
32 benefit payable to the qualifying member while alive and at the qualifying member's
33 death to have the benefit continued in the same amount for the life of the beneficiary
34 that the qualifying member has nominated by written designation duly notarized
35 acknowledged and filed with the chief executive director officer at the time of
36 retirement on a form provided or specified by the Maine Public Employees Retirement
37 System, if the beneficiary survives the qualifying member.
38 C. Under Option 3, the qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement
39 benefit payable to the qualifying member while alive and at the qualifying member's
40 death to have the benefit continued at 1/2 the amount for the life of the beneficiary that
41 the qualifying member has nominated by written designation duly acknowledged and
42 filed with the chief executive director officer at the time of retirement on a form
43 provided or specified by the Maine Public Employees Retirement System, if the
44 beneficiary survives the qualifying member.

1 D. Under Option 4, the qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement
2 benefit payable to the qualifying member while alive and at the qualifying member's
3 death to have some benefit other than that available under paragraph B or C payable to
4 the beneficiary that the qualifying member has designated, if the beneficiary survives
5 the qualifying member. The total value of the benefit paid to the qualifying member
6 during the qualifying member's life plus the benefit paid after the qualifying member's
7 death is the actuarial equivalent of the benefit that the qualifying member would have
8 received without optional modification. The method used to determine the benefit
9 must be approved by the board of trustees, and the beneficiary must be designated by
10 written designation, duly notarized acknowledged and filed with the chief executive
11 director officer on a form provided or specified by the Maine Public Employees
12 Retirement System.
13 E. Under Option 5, the qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement
14 benefit payable in part to the qualifying member and in part to the beneficiary, who
15 must be the sole beneficiary, while both are alive and, at the death of either, to have the
16 higher benefit paid to the survivor for the survivor's life. The total value of the benefit
17 paid to the qualifying member and beneficiary, during the qualifying member's life,
18 plus the benefit to be paid after the death of either is the actuarial equivalent of the
19 benefit that the qualifying member would have received without optional modification.

22 acknowledged and filed with the chief executive director officer on a form provided or
23 specified by the Maine Public Employees Retirement System.
24 F. Under Option 6, the qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement
25 benefit payable to the qualifying member while alive and, at the qualifying member's
26 death, to have the benefit continued in the same amount for the life of the beneficiary,
27 who must be the sole beneficiary, that the qualifying member has designated by written
28 designation, duly notarized acknowledged and filed with the chief executive director
29 officer on a form provided or specified by the Maine Public Employees Retirement
30 System, if the beneficiary survives the qualifying member. If the qualifying member's
31 beneficiary predeceases the qualifying member, the qualifying member's benefit must
32 be changed, effective the first day of the month following the date of the beneficiary's
33 death, to be the actuarial equivalent of the benefit that the qualifying member would
34 have received without optional modification. The reduced retirement benefit must be
35 actuarially calculated to reflect the fact that the benefit may be changed to the larger
36 amount should the beneficiary predecease the member.
37 G. Under Option 7, the qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement
38 benefit payable to the qualifying member while alive and, at the qualifying member's
39 death, to have the benefit continued at 1/2 that amount for the life of the beneficiary,
40 who must be the sole beneficiary, that the qualifying member has designated by written
41 designation, duly notarized acknowledged and filed with the chief executive director
42 officer on a form provided or specified by the Maine Public Employees Retirement
43 System, if the beneficiary survives the qualifying member. If the qualifying member's
44 beneficiary predeceases the qualifying member, the qualifying member's benefit must
45 be changed, effective the first day of the month following the date of the beneficiary's
46 death, to the actuarial equivalent of the benefit that the qualifying member would have
Page 3 - 132LR0539(01)

417 received without optional modification. The reduced retirement benefit must be
428 actuarially calculated to reflect the fact that the benefit may be changed to the larger
439 amount should the beneficiary predecease the member.
4 H. Under Option 8, the qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement
5 benefit payable to the qualifying member while alive and, at the qualifying member's
6 death, to have some benefit other than that available under paragraph B or C payable
7 to the beneficiary, who must be the sole beneficiary, that the member has designated
8 by written designation, duly acknowledged and filed with the chief executive officer
9 on a form provided or specified by the Maine Public Employees Retirement System, if
10 the beneficiary survives the qualifying member. The total value of the benefit paid to
11 the qualifying member plus the benefit paid after the qualifying member's death is the
12 actuarial equivalent of the benefit that the qualifying member would have received
13 without optional modification. If the qualifying member's beneficiary predeceases the
14 qualifying member, the qualifying member's benefit must be changed, effective the
15 first day of the month following the date of the beneficiary's death, to be the actuarial
16 equivalent of the benefit that the qualifying member would have received without
17 optional modification. The reduced retirement benefit must be actuarially calculated
18 to reflect the fact that the benefit may be changed to the larger amount should the
19 beneficiary predecease the member.

14 employee of the same employer would have been employed unless the board has
