on the basis of the option selected.
The qualifying member may elect one of the options by written request to and approval of
the executive director prior to the commencement of payment of a regular retirement
allowance. The election may be revoked by written notice to the executive director at any
time before the regular retirement allowance commences.
For the purposes of this subsection, "qualifying member" means a member or a former
member who has been receiving a disability retirement benefit and changes to service
retirement under section 1353, subsection 7.
A. Under Option 1, the qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement
benefit paid to the qualifying member while alive and at the qualifying member's death
to have the excess, if any, of the qualifying member's accumulated contributions at the
time of retirement over the portion of the total retirement benefit payments actually
made to the qualifying member while alive, which is the actuarial equivalent of the
accumulated contributions, paid in a lump sum to the beneficiary that the qualifying
member has nominated by written designation duly notarized acknowledged and filed
with the chief executive director officer on a form provided or specified by the Maine
Page 2 - 132LR0539(03)
Public Employees Retirement System or, if no one has been nominated as beneficiary,
to the qualifying member's estate.
B. Under Option 2, the qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement
benefit payable to the qualifying member while alive and at the qualifying member's
death to have the benefit continued in the same amount for the life of the beneficiary
that the qualifying member has nominated by written designation duly notarized
acknowledged and filed with the chief executive director officer at the time of
retirement on a form provided or specified by the Maine Public Employees Retirement
System, if the beneficiary survives the qualifying member.
C. Under Option 3, the qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement
benefit payable to the qualifying member while alive and at the qualifying member's
death to have the benefit continued at 1/2 the amount for the life of the beneficiary that
the qualifying member has nominated by written designation duly acknowledged and
filed with the chief executive director officer at the time of retirement on a form
provided or specified by the Maine Public Employees Retirement System, if the
beneficiary survives the qualifying member.
D. Under Option 4, the qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement
benefit payable to the qualifying member while alive and at the qualifying member's
death to have some benefit other than that available under paragraph B or C payable to
the beneficiary that the qualifying member has designated, if the beneficiary survives
the qualifying member. The total value of the benefit paid to the qualifying member
during the qualifying member's life plus the benefit paid after the qualifying member's
death is the actuarial equivalent of the benefit that the qualifying member would have
received without optional modification. The method used to determine the benefit
must be approved by the board of trustees, and the beneficiary must be designated by
written designation, duly notarized acknowledged and filed with the chief executive
director officer on a form provided or specified by the Maine Public Employees
Retirement System.
E. Under Option 5, the qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement
benefit payable in part to the qualifying member and in part to the beneficiary, who
must be the sole beneficiary, while both are alive and, at the death of either, to have the
higher benefit paid to the survivor for the survivor's life. The total value of the benefit
paid to the qualifying member and beneficiary, during the qualifying member's life,
plus the benefit to be paid after the death of either is the actuarial equivalent of the
benefit that the qualifying member would have received without optional modification.
The method used to determine the benefit must be approved by the board of trustees,
and the beneficiary must be designated by written designation, duly notarized
acknowledged and filed with the chief executive director officer on a form provided or
specified by the Maine Public Employees Retirement System.

benefit payable to the qualifying member while alive and, at the qualifying member's
death, to have the benefit continued in the same amount for the life of the beneficiary,
who must be the sole beneficiary, that the qualifying member has designated by written
designation, duly notarized acknowledged and filed with the chief executive director
officer on a form provided or specified by the Maine Public Employees Retirement
System, if the beneficiary survives the qualifying member. If the qualifying member's
Page 3 - 132LR0539(03)
beneficiary predeceases the qualifying member, the qualifying member's benefit must
be changed, effective the first day of the month following the date of the beneficiary's
death, to be the actuarial equivalent of the benefit that the qualifying member would
have received without optional modification. The reduced retirement benefit must be
actuarially calculated to reflect the fact that the benefit may be changed to the larger
amount should the beneficiary predecease the member.
G. Under Option 7, the qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement
benefit payable to the qualifying member while alive and, at the qualifying member's
death, to have the benefit continued at 1/2 that amount for the life of the beneficiary,
who must be the sole beneficiary, that the qualifying member has designated by written
designation, duly notarized acknowledged and filed with the chief executive director
officer on a form provided or specified by the Maine Public Employees Retirement
System, if the beneficiary survives the qualifying member. If the qualifying member's
beneficiary predeceases the qualifying member, the qualifying member's benefit must
be changed, effective the first day of the month following the date of the beneficiary's
death, to the actuarial equivalent of the benefit that the qualifying member would have
received without optional modification. The reduced retirement benefit must be
actuarially calculated to reflect the fact that the benefit may be changed to the larger
amount should the beneficiary predecease the member.
H. Under Option 8, the qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement
benefit payable to the qualifying member while alive and, at the qualifying member's
death, to have some benefit other than that available under paragraph B or C payable
to the beneficiary, who must be the sole beneficiary, that the member has designated
by written designation, duly acknowledged and filed with the chief executive officer
on a form provided or specified by the Maine Public Employees Retirement System, if
the beneficiary survives the qualifying member. The total value of the benefit paid to
the qualifying member plus the benefit paid after the qualifying member's death is the
actuarial equivalent of the benefit that the qualifying member would have received
without optional modification. If the qualifying member's beneficiary predeceases the
qualifying member, the qualifying member's benefit must be changed, effective the
first day of the month following the date of the beneficiary's death, to be the actuarial
equivalent of the benefit that the qualifying member would have received without
optional modification. The reduced retirement benefit must be actuarially calculated
to reflect the fact that the benefit may be changed to the larger amount should the
beneficiary predecease the member.

interest, if applicable, must be paid to the retirement system by the school district,

5-E. Option 8. The qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement benefit
payable to the qualifying member while alive and at the qualifying member's death to have
some benefit other than that available under subsection 3 or 4 payable to the beneficiary,
who must be the sole beneficiary, that the member has designated by written designation,
duly acknowledged and filed with the chief executive officer on a form provided or
specified by the retirement system, if the beneficiary survives the qualifying member. The
total value of the benefit paid to the qualifying member plus the benefit paid after the
qualifying member's death is the actuarial equivalent of the benefit that the qualifying
member would have received without optional modification. If the qualifying member's
beneficiary predeceases the qualifying member, the qualifying member's benefit must be
changed, effective the first day of the month following the date of the beneficiary's death,
to be the actuarial equivalent of the benefit that the qualifying member would have received
without optional modification. The reduced retirement benefit must be actuarially
calculated to reflect the fact that the benefit may be changed to the larger amount should
the beneficiary predecease the member.

Page 1 - 132LR0539(03)

A. A member with less than 5 years of continuous creditable service immediately
preceding an application for a disability allowance that member's last date of service is
not eligible for that a disability retirement allowance if that disability is the result of a
physical or mental condition which that existed prior to the person's latest membership
in a retirement program of the Maine Public Employees Retirement System, unless the
disability is a result of, or has been substantially aggravated by, an injury or accident
received in the line of duty.
Sec. 7. 4 MRSA §1353, sub-§5, as amended by PL 2007, c. 491, §51, is further
amended to read:
5. Earnings. The chief executive director officer may require each disability
beneficiary to submit an annual statement of earnings received from any gainful occupation
during that year. For any year during which the total of those earnings and the disability
allowance exceeds the current salary of the position that the disabled beneficiary last held,
the excess must be deducted from any disability retirement allowance payments made to
the beneficiary during the next calendar year. These deductions are prorated on a monthly
basis, in an equitable manner prescribed by the board of trustees, over the year or part of
the year for which benefits are received in accordance with Title 5, section 17054,
subsection 3. The beneficiary is responsible for reimbursing the Maine Public Employees
Retirement System for any excess earnings not so deducted.
If a beneficiary does not submit an earnings statement within 30 days of receiving a request
from the chief executive director officer, the disability retirement allowance is discontinued
until the statement is submitted. If the statement is not submitted within one year of
receiving a request, all the beneficiary's rights to any further benefits cease.
Sec. 8. 4 MRSA §1357, sub-§2, as corrected by RR 2021, c. 2, Pt. A, §2, is amended
to read:
2. Optional methods of payment. In lieu of payment under subsection 1, a qualifying
member may elect to receive a regular retirement allowance under one of the options set
out in this subsection. The optional allowance is a reduced allowance computed actuarially
on the basis of the option selected.
The qualifying member may elect one of the options by written request to and approval of
the executive director prior to the commencement of payment of a regular retirement
allowance. The election may be revoked by written notice to the executive director at any
time before the regular retirement allowance commences.
For the purposes of this subsection, "qualifying member" means a member or a former
member who has been receiving a disability retirement benefit and changes to service
retirement under section 1353, subsection 7.
A. Under Option 1, the qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement
benefit paid to the qualifying member while alive and at the qualifying member's death
to have the excess, if any, of the qualifying member's accumulated contributions at the
time of retirement over the portion of the total retirement benefit payments actually
made to the qualifying member while alive, which is the actuarial equivalent of the
accumulated contributions, paid in a lump sum to the beneficiary that the qualifying
member has nominated by written designation duly notarized acknowledged and filed
with the chief executive director officer on a form provided or specified by the Maine
Page 2 - 132LR0539(03)

Public Employees Retirement System or, if no one has been nominated as beneficiary,
to the qualifying member's estate.
B. Under Option 2, the qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement
benefit payable to the qualifying member while alive and at the qualifying member's
death to have the benefit continued in the same amount for the life of the beneficiary
that the qualifying member has nominated by written designation duly notarized
acknowledged and filed with the chief executive director officer at the time of
retirement on a form provided or specified by the Maine Public Employees Retirement
System, if the beneficiary survives the qualifying member.
C. Under Option 3, the qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement
benefit payable to the qualifying member while alive and at the qualifying member's
death to have the benefit continued at 1/2 the amount for the life of the beneficiary that
the qualifying member has nominated by written designation duly acknowledged and
filed with the chief executive director officer at the time of retirement on a form
provided or specified by the Maine Public Employees Retirement System, if the
beneficiary survives the qualifying member.
D. Under Option 4, the qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement
benefit payable to the qualifying member while alive and at the qualifying member's
death to have some benefit other than that available under paragraph B or C payable to
the beneficiary that the qualifying member has designated, if the beneficiary survives
the qualifying member. The total value of the benefit paid to the qualifying member
during the qualifying member's life plus the benefit paid after the qualifying member's
death is the actuarial equivalent of the benefit that the qualifying member would have
received without optional modification. The method used to determine the benefit
must be approved by the board of trustees, and the beneficiary must be designated by
written designation, duly notarized acknowledged and filed with the chief executive
director officer on a form provided or specified by the Maine Public Employees
Retirement System.
E. Under Option 5, the qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement
benefit payable in part to the qualifying member and in part to the beneficiary, who
must be the sole beneficiary, while both are alive and, at the death of either, to have the
higher benefit paid to the survivor for the survivor's life. The total value of the benefit
paid to the qualifying member and beneficiary, during the qualifying member's life,
plus the benefit to be paid after the death of either is the actuarial equivalent of the
benefit that the qualifying member would have received without optional modification.
The method used to determine the benefit must be approved by the board of trustees,
and the beneficiary must be designated by written designation, duly notarized
acknowledged and filed with the chief executive director officer on a form provided or
specified by the Maine Public Employees Retirement System.
F. Under Option 6, the qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement
benefit payable to the qualifying member while alive and, at the qualifying member's
death, to have the benefit continued in the same amount for the life of the beneficiary,
who must be the sole beneficiary, that the qualifying member has designated by written
designation, duly notarized acknowledged and filed with the chief executive director
officer on a form provided or specified by the Maine Public Employees Retirement
System, if the beneficiary survives the qualifying member. If the qualifying member's
Page 3 - 132LR0539(03)

beneficiary predeceases the qualifying member, the qualifying member's benefit must
be changed, effective the first day of the month following the date of the beneficiary's
death, to be the actuarial equivalent of the benefit that the qualifying member would
have received without optional modification. The reduced retirement benefit must be
actuarially calculated to reflect the fact that the benefit may be changed to the larger
amount should the beneficiary predecease the member.
G. Under Option 7, the qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement
benefit payable to the qualifying member while alive and, at the qualifying member's
death, to have the benefit continued at 1/2 that amount for the life of the beneficiary,
who must be the sole beneficiary, that the qualifying member has designated by written
designation, duly notarized acknowledged and filed with the chief executive director
officer on a form provided or specified by the Maine Public Employees Retirement
System, if the beneficiary survives the qualifying member. If the qualifying member's
beneficiary predeceases the qualifying member, the qualifying member's benefit must
be changed, effective the first day of the month following the date of the beneficiary's
death, to the actuarial equivalent of the benefit that the qualifying member would have
received without optional modification. The reduced retirement benefit must be
actuarially calculated to reflect the fact that the benefit may be changed to the larger
amount should the beneficiary predecease the member.
H. Under Option 8, the qualifying member may elect to have a reduced retirement
benefit payable to the qualifying member while alive and, at the qualifying member's
death, to have some benefit other than that available under paragraph B or C payable
to the beneficiary, who must be the sole beneficiary, that the member has designated
by written designation, duly acknowledged and filed with the chief executive officer
on a form provided or specified by the Maine Public Employees Retirement System, if
the beneficiary survives the qualifying member. The total value of the benefit paid to
the qualifying member plus the benefit paid after the qualifying member's death is the
actuarial equivalent of the benefit that the qualifying member would have received
without optional modification. If the qualifying member's beneficiary predeceases the
qualifying member, the qualifying member's benefit must be changed, effective the
first day of the month following the date of the beneficiary's death, to be the actuarial
equivalent of the benefit that the qualifying member would have received without
optional modification. The reduced retirement benefit must be actuarially calculated
to reflect the fact that the benefit may be changed to the larger amount should the
beneficiary predecease the member.

leave; or.

employee of the same employer would have been employed unless the board has
established by rule a benefit computation method that otherwise prevents overlapping
reduction of benefits for part-time, seasonal or temporary employees due to working
less than full-time and earning less than full-time equivalent compensation.

refund of contributions or overpayment or erroneous payment of life insurance benefits
may be recovered from an individual's contributions, any benefits or life insurance benefits
payable under this Part to the individual or the beneficiary of the individual or any
combination of contributions and benefits. If the overpayment or excess refund of
contributions resulted from a mistake of or incorrect information provided by an employee
of the retirement system, or a mistake of the retiree or the recipient of the benefit or life
insurance benefit, a penalty or interest may not be assessed by the retirement system. In
all cases of recovery of overpayments through the reduction of a retirement benefit, whether
with or without the assessment of interest by the retirement system, the recovery practices
must be reasonable and consider the personal economic stability of the retiree in the
establishment of the recovery schedule. The chief executive officer may also take action
to recover those amounts due from any amounts payable to the individual by any other state
agency or by an action in a court of competent jurisdiction. Whenever the chief executive
officer makes a decision to recover any amounts under this subsection, other than by an
action in a court of competent jurisdiction, that decision is subject to appeal under section
17451.
Employers are responsible for enrolling employees in the correct retirement plan. The
retirement system shall provide training, education and information to assist employers in
the correct enrollment of employees. If an employee is enrolled in the incorrect retirement
plan by the employer through no fault of the employee, the employee may not lose any
retirement benefits. The State is not responsible for the employer contribution when the
employer is a school district, municipality or county and those contributions and assessed
interest, if applicable, must be paid to the retirement system by the school district,
municipality or county;
