2200 current law, unallocated balances in excess of 5% of the previous fiscal year's school budget
2211 must be used to reduce the state and local share of the total allocation for the purposes of
2222 computing state subsidy and school boards may carry forward unallocated balances in
2233 excess of 5% of the previous year's school budget and disburse the funds over a period not
2244 to exceed 3 years, except for in fiscal years 2021-22, 2022-23, 2023-24 and 2024-25, during
2255 which time the applicable percentage threshold is 9% of the previous year's school budget,
2266 not 5%.
27 The bill modifies this provision to provide that the temporary percentage threshold of
28 9% applies to all future fiscal years.
