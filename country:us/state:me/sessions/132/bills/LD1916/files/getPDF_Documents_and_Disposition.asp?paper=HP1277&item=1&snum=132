22 jurisdiction over the criminal proceeding that resulted in the eligible criminal conviction in
23 accordance with this section.
24 1. Monthly examination of records. The bureau shall at least once a month examine
25 criminal history record information collected and maintained by the bureau pursuant to

7 SUMMARY
88 This bill is reported out by the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary to implement
99 statutory changes recommended by the Criminal Records Review Committee. The Joint
1100 Standing Committee on Judiciary has not taken a position on the substance of this bill. By
1111 reporting this bill out, the committee is not suggesting and does not intend to suggest that
1122 it agrees or disagrees with any aspect of this bill; instead, the committee is reporting the
1133 bill out for the sole purpose of having a bill printed that can be referred to the committee
1144 for an appropriate public hearing and subsequent processing in the normal course. The
1155 committee is taking this action to ensure clarity and transparency in the legislative review
1166 of the proposals contained in the bill.
17 The bill implements a recommendation of the Criminal Records Review Committee.
18 The bill creates a process to automatically seal or make confidential criminal history record
19 information related to convictions for marijuana possession and cultivation-related crimes
20 committed on or after January 1, 2001 and prior to January 30, 2017 for engaging in
21 conduct that is no longer illegal under the State's adult use cannabis laws. The process
22 requires the Department of Public Safety, Bureau of State Police, State Bureau of
23 Identification to review monthly the criminal history record information obtained in its files
24 to determine if the underlying convictions for certain criminal history record information
25 qualify for automatic sealing. If a conviction qualifies for the sealing of information, the
26 bureau must transfer that information to the Administrative Office of the Courts, which is
27 required to do the same with its files for the corresponding underlying convictions.
28 Once the Administrative Office of the Courts has compiled all of the relevant
29 information, the bill requires the Administrative Office of the Courts to submit that
30 information to the Superior Court or District Court having jurisdiction over the underlying
31 criminal proceeding that resulted in the conviction. That court is required to determine
32 whether the underlying criminal conviction qualifies to have the criminal history record
33 information related to the conviction sealed. If it does qualify, the court is required to send
34 notice to the bureau to make that criminal history record information confidential. If it
35 does not qualify, the court is required to send the order denying the sealing of information
36 to the bureau to be filed with the criminal history record information for that underlying
37 conviction.
38 The bill provides that a person aggrieved by a finding that the person's conviction does
39 not qualify for automatic sealing does not have a right to appeal, but the Supreme Judicial
40 Court may make rules for the manner for taking such an appeal. Regardless of a finding
41 that a person's conviction does not qualify for automatic sealing, the person is still permitted
42 to file a motion to seal the criminal history record information for that conviction. The
43 State may appeal a decision granting automatic sealing of an eligible criminal conviction
44 as a matter of right.
