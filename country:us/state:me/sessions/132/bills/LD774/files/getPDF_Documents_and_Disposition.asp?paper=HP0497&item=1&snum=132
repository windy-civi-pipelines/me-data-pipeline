28 must have one or more clearly visible, centrally located and easily accessible bleeding
29 control kits in a number adequate to service the population of the state-owned building at
30 maximum occupancy.
31 This subsection does not apply to a state-owned building that is vacant, under construction
32 or under renovation.
33 3. Inspection of bleeding control kits. A bleeding control kit must be inspected on a
34 regular basis. The inspection must include whether:
35 A. All required materials and supplies are present;

1 Each bleeding control kit must contain an inspection log indicating the date of each
2 inspection, any deficiencies discovered by the inspection and the action, if any, taken to
3 address the deficiency.
4 4. Use of bleeding control kits. This section does not compel or require any person
5 to respond to an emergency or use a bleeding control kit. A person who, in good faith and
6 without compensation, renders emergency care with a bleeding control kit is not liable for
7 civil damages for any act or omission in using the bleeding control kit unless the act or
8 omission is grossly negligent or purposeful.
9 5. Bleeding Control Kit Fund. The Bleeding Control Kit Fund is established. The
10 fund is administered by the department to provide a grant to or to reimburse a school,
11 business or other organization that places a bleeding control kit on the school's, business's
12 or organization's premises or that makes available a bleeding control training program or a
13 similar program. The fund consists of appropriations, allocations or money received
14 through grants, gifts or donations from public or private sources. Funds in the fund do not
15 lapse but carry over to the next fiscal year. Interest from the fund accrues to the fund.
16 6. Rules. The department may adopt rules to implement this section. Rules adopted
17 pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules pursuant to chapter 375, subchapter
18 2-A.
19 Sec. 2. Identification of state-owned buildings requiring placement of
20 bleeding control kits. By July 1, 2026, the Department of Administrative and Financial
21 Services, in consultation with the Department of Public Safety, Maine Emergency Medical
22 Services, shall identify the state-owned buildings requiring placement of bleeding control
23 kits, the order of priority of state-owned buildings for placement of bleeding control kits,
24 the number and locations for placement of bleeding control kits for each state-owned
25 building and a schedule for future placements of bleeding control kits. This section does
26 not apply to a state-owned building that is vacant, under construction or under renovation.
27 For purposes of this section, "bleeding control kit" has the same meaning as in the Maine
28 Revised Statutes, Title 5, section 1755, subsection 1, paragraph A and "state-owned
29 building" has the same meaning as in Title 5, section 1755, subsection 1, paragraph C.

3322 fund to provide grants or reimbursements to schools, businesses or other organizations that
