1 The bill also establishes the nonlapsing Construction Materials Reclamation Fund
2 within the department to provide grants, loans or other funding to any public or private
3 entity to support the development and certification of construction materials reclamation
4 facilities, training programs for individuals operating and employed at those facilities and
5 public outreach and education initiatives regarding those facilities. Beginning January 1,
6 2026, this fund will receive a new $10 per ton fee imposed on the landfill disposal of

10 The bill establishes a new state goal that, by January 1, 2036, the total tonnage of
11 construction and demolition debris annually disposed of at solid waste landfills in the State

13 generation and disposal capacity data gathered by the Department of Environmental
14 Protection.
15 The bill also directs the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau
16 of Revenue Services to develop a proposal for implementation of a refundable tax credit
17 for housing developers that purchase for use in the construction of affordable housing in

19 reclamation facility. The credit must be equal to 100% of the documented cost of the
20 reclaimed construction materials purchased by the developer from a construction materials
21 reclamation facility. The bureau is also required to develop a proposal for implementation
22 of a charitable deduction from individual income tax for individuals or businesses who
