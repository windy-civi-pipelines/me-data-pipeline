6 company in this State, the routes of hazardous materials shipments and the frequency
7 of hazardous materials operations on those routes that are in the possession of a state
8 or local emergency management entity or law enforcement agency, fire department or
9 other first responder, except that records related to a train carrying hazardous materials
10 that has derailed at any point from a main line train track or related to a discharge of
11 hazardous materials transported by a railroad company that poses a threat to public
12 health, safety and welfare are subject to public disclosure after that discharge. For the

24 participant's residence to check on the participant's well-being.; and

26 W. Notwithstanding any provision of Title 23, section 7311 to the contrary, during the

28 railroad line, reports of a law enforcement agency regarding that accident and all
29 records of communication between the law enforcement agency and a railroad
30 company employee involved in that accident. A law enforcement agency that responds
31 to the accident shall maintain such reports and records in a manner that ensures
32 confidentiality of the reports and records, except that the reports and records may be
33 accessible at all reasonable times, upon written request, to:
34 (1) A railroad company responsible for the railroad or railroad line on which the
35 accident occurred;
36 (2) A railroad company whose employee is identified in a report or record; and
37 (3) Any other person authorized by judicial order to obtain the reports or records
38 under this paragraph if access to the report or record is necessary in the
39 performance of the person's duties.
40 The reports and records under this paragraph must be accessible at all reasonable times,
41 upon written or e-mail request to law enforcement agencies, district attorneys and
