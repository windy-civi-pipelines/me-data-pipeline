21 salary must be prorated from the date the successor is sworn into office.
22 SUMMARY
2233 This bill amends the provisions of law governing legislative compensation. The bill
2244 removes specific dollar amounts that Legislators may be reimbursed for meal allowances,
2255 travel-related expenses of a meal allowance and housing allowances and instead provides
2266 that the rate of these allowances must be set by the Legislative Council. These changes
2277 apply to allowances for days the Legislature is in session and for days the Legislature is
2288 not in session. The bill clarifies that to set the amount of the allowances, at least 6 members
2299 of the Legislative Council must vote in favor of the allowance at the beginning of the first
3300 regular session in a legislative biennium. The amount of an allowance set by the Legislative
3311 Council may not exceed the regular federal per diem rate for lodging, meals and incidental
3322 expenses applicable to that allowance.
33 The bill clarifies that for the purposes of allowances for mileage on days that the
34 Legislature is not in session, daily mileage is calculated from the Legislator's place of
35 abode, determined by the most reasonable direct route.
36 The bill amends the provision governing the salary owed to a person who replaces a
37 member of the Legislature who has died or otherwise vacated the office. The bill provides
38 that the successor is entitled to a salary from the date the successor is seated equal to the
39 salary that would have been afforded to the successor had the successor been seated at the
40 start of the biennium, except that the salary must be prorated from the date the successor is
41 sworn into office.
