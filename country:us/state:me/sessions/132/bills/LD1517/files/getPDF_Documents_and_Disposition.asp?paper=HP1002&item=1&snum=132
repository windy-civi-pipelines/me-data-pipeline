3344 Current law requires the total number of votes cast for certain school, municipal or
3355 county measures to be at least equal to or exceed a percentage of votes cast in the
3366 municipality or county, as relevant, in the last gubernatorial election in order for the result
3377 of the vote to be valid. This bill reduces the needed percentage of votes cast in the last
3388 gubernatorial election for the result to be considered valid but requires that percentage to
3399 be in favor of the measure being considered.
