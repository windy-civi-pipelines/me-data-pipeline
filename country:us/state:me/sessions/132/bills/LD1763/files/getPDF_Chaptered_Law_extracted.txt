application under this section.
A. The bureau may request additional information from the applicant, government
agencies or other parties when necessary to complete its review of an application and
make a decision.
B. The bureau shall notify interested parties of receipt of a completed application. As
determined by the bureau on a case-by-case basis, interested parties may include, but
are not limited to, abutting landowners, landowners with overlapping littoral zones,
local municipal officials, harbor masters or others engaged in commercial marine
activities or who have notified the bureau of their interest in a particular project.
Interested parties must be given 30 days to provide the bureau with comments on a
completed application.
C. If the bureau determines that a letter of no objection is required from one or more
littoral abutters, the bureau shall send notice to the abutters and the applicant.
D. The bureau or its designee may conduct inspections of the proposed project site in
order to assess on-site conditions, the characteristics and uses of adjacent lands, waters
and structures and potential impacts on existing trusts.
Page 5 - 132LR0885(05)
E. After the initial 30-day review period under paragraph B, if the bureau determines
that it is appropriate, additional information may be requested from the applicant or
other parties or a public informational meeting may be scheduled in order to allow the
general public to provide additional information for consideration.
F. Once all requested information is received and any public meetings under paragraph
E have been concluded, the bureau shall issue preliminary findings. Preliminary
findings must be sent to the applicant and all parties who provided comments during
the initial review period and other interested parties.
G. Within 30 days of the issuance of preliminary findings under paragraph F, any party
may petition the bureau director to reconsider such findings by written request. The
bureau director may waive the reconsideration period if no comments are received
during the initial review period or if the comments that are received are determined to
not be related to public trust rights.
H. The bureau shall review any petitions for reconsideration under paragraph G and
related information and issue its final findings and decision. If the decision is to
approve the application, 2 original copies of the lease must be sent to the applicant for
signature.

Section 32:
4. Bureau determination. In making its determination with respect to an application
under this section, the bureau shall consider the following:
A. Whether the applicant has demonstrated that the applicant has sufficient right, title
or interest to the upland property, including intertidal land, adjacent to the littoral zone
in which the nonwater-dependent floating structure lease is sought. To demonstrate
right, title or interest, an applicant must provide:
(1) When the applicant owns the property, a copy of the deed to the property;
(2) When the applicant has a lease on the property, a copy of the lease. The lease
must be of sufficient duration and terms, as determined by the bureau, to permit
reasonable use of the facility; and
(3) When the applicant has an option to buy or lease the property, a copy of the
option agreement. The option agreement must contain terms considered sufficient
by the bureau to establish future title or a leasehold of sufficient duration;
B. Whether littoral zones and setback standards delineate the lease area adjacent to the
applicant's upland property and establish adequate separation between structures for
navigation and access both for the public and riparian owners. Littoral zones do not
delineate areas for the exclusive use of the applicant or other riparian owners. Littoral
zone boundaries are established by right angle projections from a baseline established
along the shoreline at the intersection of the high-water line and the side boundary of
each property. The littoral zone sidelines terminate at either the established
navigational channel, established anchorage identified as such by the United States
Army Corps of Engineers, the midline between opposing shorelines or 1,000 feet,
whichever is less. Setback standards are established from other existing structures and
an applicant's littoral zone boundary. When littoral zones overlap, structures must be
set back 25 feet from an applicant's littoral zone sidelines and must be 50 feet from
other existing structures;
Page 6 - 132LR0885(05)
C. Whether the proposed use of the lease area would unreasonably interfere with
customary or traditional public access ways;
D. Whether the proposed use of the lease area would unreasonably interfere with the
public trust rights of fishing, fowling and navigation;
E. Whether there are other commercial marine services or facilities in the proposed
lease area;
F. Whether the nonwater-dependent floating structure would unreasonably interfere
with ingress and egress of riparian owners;
G. Whether the nonwater-dependent floating structure would result in significant risk
to life or property in the vicinity of the use under conditions of weather and vessel
traffic;
H. Whether there is evidence in the record that any portion of the proposed lease area
has been designated for special protection by an agency authorized to make such
designations;
I. Whether the use conflicts with those aspects of the coastal policies or the coastal
policy guidelines in section 1801 that relate to the criteria considered by the bureau;
J. Whether the lease terms require the applicant to obtain all necessary federal, state
and local approvals; and
K. Whether the applicant has paid the fee required for processing the application.
The bureau may consult with other agencies and organizations as appropriate when
considering the terms of a submerged lands nonwater-dependent floating structure lease.

Section 33:
5. Bureau approval required. If approved for the issuance of a lease, the owner may
continue to operate the nonwater-dependent floating structure in accordance with the
requirements of this section and subject to the terms of the lease.

Section 34:
6. Operational standards. A nonwater-dependent floating structure that is authorized
to continue operating pursuant to a lease issued in accordance with this section must meet
all applicable standards in law or rule or the structure's authorization to continue operation
may be revoked through a termination of the lease. A nonwater-dependent floating
structure must meet the following criteria.
A. The structure must be labeled with the owner's name, telephone number and e-mail
address.
B. If the structure is located on coastal waters, it must comply with 33 United States
Code, Section 1322.
C. If the structure is located on inland waters, it must comply with section 423, have a
waterless composting or desiccating toilet, have a holding tank for which tank pumping
records must be provided upon request or have landside-only facilities, meaning no
toilet, shower or sink on board that discharges.
D. The structure is subject to inspection by representatives of the State to ensure
compliance with any of the provisions of applicable law or rule.

Section 35:
7. Limitations. The following limitations apply.
Page 7 - 132LR0885(05)
A. A lease may not be issued under this section for an area greater than 1,500 square
feet.
B. Once sited in accordance with a lease issued under this section, a nonwater-
dependent floating structure may not be sited in any other location on the internal
waters of the State.
C. A lease may be issued under this section for a 10-year term, which is renewable. If
the nonwater-dependent floating structure is destroyed or has met the end of its useful
life prior to the expiration of the lease, the lease authorization under this section
expires.

Section 36:
8. Lease fees. The following lease fees apply with respect to leases issued under this

Section 37:
section.

A. The bureau may request additional information from the applicant, government
agencies or other parties when necessary to complete its review of an application and
make a decision.
B. The bureau shall notify interested parties of receipt of a completed application. As
determined by the bureau on a case-by-case basis, interested parties may include, but
are not limited to, abutting landowners, landowners with overlapping littoral zones,
local municipal officials, harbor masters or others engaged in commercial marine
activities or who have notified the bureau of their interest in a particular project.
Interested parties must be given 30 days to provide the bureau with comments on a
completed application.
C. If the bureau determines that a letter of no objection is required from one or more
littoral abutters, the bureau shall send notice to the abutters and the applicant.

order to assess on-site conditions, the characteristics and uses of adjacent lands, waters
and structures and potential impacts on existing trusts.
Page 5 - 132LR0885(05)

E. After the initial 30-day review period under paragraph B, if the bureau determines
that it is appropriate, additional information may be requested from the applicant or
other parties or a public informational meeting may be scheduled in order to allow the
general public to provide additional information for consideration.
F. Once all requested information is received and any public meetings under paragraph
E have been concluded, the bureau shall issue preliminary findings. Preliminary
findings must be sent to the applicant and all parties who provided comments during
the initial review period and other interested parties.
G. Within 30 days of the issuance of preliminary findings under paragraph F, any party
may petition the bureau director to reconsider such findings by written request. The
bureau director may waive the reconsideration period if no comments are received
during the initial review period or if the comments that are received are determined to
not be related to public trust rights.
H. The bureau shall review any petitions for reconsideration under paragraph G and
related information and issue its final findings and decision. If the decision is to
approve the application, 2 original copies of the lease must be sent to the applicant for
signature.
4. Bureau determination. In making its determination with respect to an application
under this section, the bureau shall consider the following:
A. Whether the applicant has demonstrated that the applicant has sufficient right, title
or interest to the upland property, including intertidal land, adjacent to the littoral zone
in which the nonwater-dependent floating structure lease is sought. To demonstrate
right, title or interest, an applicant must provide:
(1) When the applicant owns the property, a copy of the deed to the property;
(2) When the applicant has a lease on the property, a copy of the lease. The lease
must be of sufficient duration and terms, as determined by the bureau, to permit
reasonable use of the facility; and
(3) When the applicant has an option to buy or lease the property, a copy of the
option agreement. The option agreement must contain terms considered sufficient
by the bureau to establish future title or a leasehold of sufficient duration;
B. Whether littoral zones and setback standards delineate the lease area adjacent to the
applicant's upland property and establish adequate separation between structures for
navigation and access both for the public and riparian owners. Littoral zones do not
delineate areas for the exclusive use of the applicant or other riparian owners. Littoral
zone boundaries are established by right angle projections from a baseline established
along the shoreline at the intersection of the high-water line and the side boundary of
each property. The littoral zone sidelines terminate at either the established
navigational channel, established anchorage identified as such by the United States
Army Corps of Engineers, the midline between opposing shorelines or 1,000 feet,
whichever is less. Setback standards are established from other existing structures and
an applicant's littoral zone boundary. When littoral zones overlap, structures must be
set back 25 feet from an applicant's littoral zone sidelines and must be 50 feet from
other existing structures;
Page 6 - 132LR0885(05)

C. Whether the proposed use of the lease area would unreasonably interfere with
customary or traditional public access ways;
D. Whether the proposed use of the lease area would unreasonably interfere with the
public trust rights of fishing, fowling and navigation;
E. Whether there are other commercial marine services or facilities in the proposed
lease area;
F. Whether the nonwater-dependent floating structure would unreasonably interfere
with ingress and egress of riparian owners;
G. Whether the nonwater-dependent floating structure would result in significant risk
to life or property in the vicinity of the use under conditions of weather and vessel
traffic;
H. Whether there is evidence in the record that any portion of the proposed lease area
has been designated for special protection by an agency authorized to make such
designations;
I. Whether the use conflicts with those aspects of the coastal policies or the coastal
policy guidelines in section 1801 that relate to the criteria considered by the bureau;
J. Whether the lease terms require the applicant to obtain all necessary federal, state
and local approvals; and
K. Whether the applicant has paid the fee required for processing the application.
The bureau may consult with other agencies and organizations as appropriate when
considering the terms of a submerged lands nonwater-dependent floating structure lease.
5. Bureau approval required. If approved for the issuance of a lease, the owner may
continue to operate the nonwater-dependent floating structure in accordance with the
requirements of this section and subject to the terms of the lease.
6. Operational standards. A nonwater-dependent floating structure that is authorized
to continue operating pursuant to a lease issued in accordance with this section must meet
all applicable standards in law or rule or the structure's authorization to continue operation
may be revoked through a termination of the lease. A nonwater-dependent floating
structure must meet the following criteria.
A. The structure must be labeled with the owner's name, telephone number and e-mail
address.
B. If the structure is located on coastal waters, it must comply with 33 United States
Code, Section 1322.
C. If the structure is located on inland waters, it must comply with section 423, have a
waterless composting or desiccating toilet, have a holding tank for which tank pumping
records must be provided upon request or have landside-only facilities, meaning no
toilet, shower or sink on board that discharges.

feet.
B. Once sited in accordance with a lease issued under this section, a nonwater-
dependent floating structure may not be sited in any other location on the internal
waters of the State.
C. A lease may be issued under this section for a 10-year term, which is renewable. If
the nonwater-dependent floating structure is destroyed or has met the end of its useful
life prior to the expiration of the lease, the lease authorization under this section
expires.
8. Lease fees. The following lease fees apply with respect to leases issued under this
section.
A. For a lease for an area that is 500 square feet or less, the annual lease fee is $250.
B. For a lease for an area that is greater than 500 square feet and less than or equal to
1,000 square feet, the annual lease fee is $500.
C. For a lease for an area that is greater than 1,000 square feet and less than or equal
to 1,500 square feet, the annual lease fee is $1,000.
9. Final agency action. Decisions made by the bureau under this section constitute
final agency action for the purposes of judicial review under Title 5, chapter 375.
§3305. Penalties; removal; abandonment
1. Penalties. Except as provided in subsection 2, a person who violates section 3302
commits a civil violation for which a fine of not less than $100 and not more than $500
may be adjudged for each day of that violation, and the person may be ordered to pay
restitution to the primary enforcement authority for costs incurred in investigating the
violation and enforcing the provisions of this chapter.
2. Repeat violations. A person who violates section 3302 after having been
adjudicated as having committed 3 or more civil violations under section 3302 within the
previous 5-year period commits a Class E crime. In addition to any penalties that may be
imposed by law for each day of that violation, the person may be ordered to pay restitution
to the primary enforcement authority for costs incurred in investigating the violation and
enforcing the provisions of this chapter.
3. Removal of structures. A person who violates section 3302 shall remove the
violating nonwater-dependent floating structure from the internal waters that the structure
was placed or used in, on or over and is responsible for all costs associated with the removal
and the costs of any damage to persons or property caused by the structure's placement or
use.
4. Abandoned structures. An abandoned nonwater-dependent floating structure may
be removed, possessed, sold, destroyed or otherwise disposed of by the State, a
municipality or other primary enforcement authority. The authority provided under this
subsection does not affect the authority granted under Title 12, section 1866 related to the
removal of an abandoned watercraft pursuant to that section.
