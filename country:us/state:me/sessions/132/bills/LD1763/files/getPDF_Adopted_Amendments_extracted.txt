1 SUMMARY
22 This amendment replaces the bill. It implements a prohibition on the placement or use
33 of a nonwater-dependent floating structure on internal waters of the State. As defined in
44 the amendment, "nonwater-dependent floating structure" means a waterborne structure that
55 is supported wholly or partially by the structure's own buoyancy and that supports a
66 nonwater-dependent use. "Nonwater-dependent uses" is defined as those uses that can
77 function in a location other than the surface waters of the State and that do not require, for
88 their primary purpose, location on submerged lands or direct access to internal waters. The
99 prohibition includes exceptions for functionally water-dependent uses, swimming
1100 structures, water toys, ice fishing shacks, aquaculture facilities, authorized nonwater-
1111 dependent floating structures, preexisting nonwater-dependent floating structures and other
1122 facilities and structures exempted through agency rulemaking. Criteria for authorized and
1133 preexisting nonwater-dependent floating structures are provided in the amendment. The
1144 amendment also establishes penalties for violating the prohibition on nonwater-dependent
1155 floating structures. Finally, the amendment directs the Department of Inland Fisheries and
1166 Wildlife to, by February 1, 2026, submit a report to the Joint Standing Committee on Inland
1177 Fisheries and Wildlife with updated information on nonwater-dependent floating structures
1188 in the State and the implementation of this legislation. The report may include
1199 recommendations for statutory changes. The committee may report out a bill based on the
2200 report to the Second Regular Session of the 132nd Legislature.

43 right, title or interest, an applicant must provide:
Page 6 - 132LR0885(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 1182, L.D. 1763
1 (1) When the applicant owns the property, a copy of the deed to the property;
2 (2) When the applicant has a lease on the property, a copy of the lease. The lease
3 must be of sufficient duration and terms, as determined by the bureau, to permit
4 reasonable use of the facility; and
5 (3) When the applicant has an option to buy or lease the property, a copy of the
6 option agreement. The option agreement must contain terms considered sufficient
7 by the bureau to establish future title or a leasehold of sufficient duration;
8 B. Whether littoral zones and setback standards delineate the lease area adjacent to the
9 applicant's upland property and establish adequate separation between structures for
10 navigation and access both for the public and riparian owners. Littoral zones do not
11 delineate areas for the exclusive use of the applicant or other riparian owners. Littoral
12 zone boundaries are established by right angle projections from a baseline established
13 along the shoreline at the intersection of the high-water line and the side boundary of
14 each property. The littoral zone sidelines terminate at either the established
15 navigational channel, established anchorage identified as such by the United States
16 Army Corps of Engineers, the midline between opposing shorelines or 1,000 feet,
17 whichever is less. Setback standards are established from other existing structures and
18 an applicant's littoral zone boundary. When littoral zones overlap, structures must be
19 set back 25 feet from an applicant's littoral zone sidelines and must be 50 feet from
20 other existing structures;
21 C. Whether the proposed use of the lease area would unreasonably interfere with
22 customary or traditional public access ways;
23 D. Whether the proposed use of the lease area would unreasonably interfere with the
24 public trust rights of fishing, fowling and navigation;
25 E. Whether there are other commercial marine services or facilities in the proposed
26 lease area;
27 F. Whether the nonwater-dependent floating structure would unreasonably interfere
28 with ingress and egress of riparian owners;
29 G. Whether the nonwater-dependent floating structure would result in significant risk
30 to life or property in the vicinity of the use under conditions of weather and vessel
31 traffic;
32 H. Whether there is evidence in the record that any portion of the proposed lease area
33 has been designated for special protection by an agency authorized to make such
34 designations;
35 I. Whether the use conflicts with those aspects of the coastal policies or the coastal
36 policy guidelines in section 1801 that relate to the criteria considered by the bureau;
37 J. Whether the lease terms require the applicant to obtain all necessary federal, state
38 and local approvals; and
39 K. Whether the applicant has paid the fee required for processing the application.
40 The bureau may consult with other agencies and organizations as appropriate when
41 considering the terms of a submerged lands nonwater-dependent floating structure lease.

14 waterless composting or desiccating toilet, have a holding tank for which tank pumping
15 records must be provided upon request or have landside-only facilities, meaning no
16 toilet, shower or sink on board that discharges.
17 D. The structure is subject to inspection by representatives of the State to ensure
18 compliance with any of the provisions of applicable law or rule.
19 7. Limitations. The following limitations apply.
20 A. A lease may not be issued under this section for an area greater than 1,500 square
21 feet.

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 1182, L.D. 1763
1 SUMMARY
22 This amendment replaces the bill. It implements a prohibition on the placement or use
33 of a nonwater-dependent floating structure on internal waters of the State. As defined in
44 the amendment, "nonwater-dependent floating structure" means a waterborne structure that
55 is supported wholly or partially by the structure's own buoyancy and that supports a
66 nonwater-dependent use. "Nonwater-dependent uses" is defined as those uses that can
77 function in a location other than the surface waters of the State and that do not require, for
88 their primary purpose, location on submerged lands or direct access to internal waters. The
99 prohibition includes exceptions for functionally water-dependent uses, swimming
1100 structures, water toys, ice fishing shacks, aquaculture facilities, authorized nonwater-
1111 dependent floating structures, preexisting nonwater-dependent floating structures and other
1122 facilities and structures exempted through agency rulemaking. Criteria for authorized and
1133 preexisting nonwater-dependent floating structures are provided in the amendment. The
1144 amendment also establishes penalties for violating the prohibition on nonwater-dependent
1155 floating structures. Finally, the amendment directs the Department of Inland Fisheries and
1166 Wildlife to, by February 1, 2026, submit a report to the Joint Standing Committee on Inland
1177 Fisheries and Wildlife with updated information on nonwater-dependent floating structures
1188 in the State and the implementation of this legislation. The report may include
1199 recommendations for statutory changes. The committee may report out a bill based on the
2200 report to the Second Regular Session of the 132nd Legislature.
