3322 "nonwater-dependent floating structure" is a waterborne structure that is supported wholly
3333 or partially by the structure's own buoyancy and that supports a nonwater-dependent use.
3344 "Nonwater-dependent uses" is defined as those uses that can function in a location other
3355 than the surface waters of the State and that do not require, for their primary purpose,
3366 location on submerged lands or direct access to inland waters or coastal waters. The
3377 prohibition includes exceptions for functionally water-dependent uses, swimming
3388 structures, water toys, ice fishing shacks and aquaculture facilities. The bill also clarifies
3399 the regulation of houseboats and homemade watercraft under the laws regulating
4400 watercraft.

29 SUMMARY
3300 This bill implements a prohibition on the placement or use of a nonwater-dependent
3311 floating structure in, on or over inland waters or coastal waters. As defined in the bill, a
3322 "nonwater-dependent floating structure" is a waterborne structure that is supported wholly
3333 or partially by the structure's own buoyancy and that supports a nonwater-dependent use.
3344 "Nonwater-dependent uses" is defined as those uses that can function in a location other
3355 than the surface waters of the State and that do not require, for their primary purpose,
3366 location on submerged lands or direct access to inland waters or coastal waters. The
3377 prohibition includes exceptions for functionally water-dependent uses, swimming
3388 structures, water toys, ice fishing shacks and aquaculture facilities. The bill also clarifies
3399 the regulation of houseboats and homemade watercraft under the laws regulating
4400 watercraft.
