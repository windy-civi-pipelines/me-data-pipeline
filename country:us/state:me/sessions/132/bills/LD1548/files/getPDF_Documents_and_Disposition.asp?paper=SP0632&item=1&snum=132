1 SUMMARY
22 This bill increases the suspension and revocation of a fishing license from 5 years to
33 10 years for the following 3 offenses: failing to acquire a permit to import live freshwater
44 fish or eggs except for live baitfish or smelts, to stock inland waters and to import live fish
55 taken within the State. It reduces the mandatory suspension of a fishing license for the
66 violation of illegal possession of live fish from 5 years to one year.
7 It adds mandatory restitution for failing to acquire a permit to stock inland waters and
8 failing to acquire a permit to introduce fish or fish eggs into a private pond, and the court
9 must order an offender to pay the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife an amount
10 equal to the cost of labor, equipment, chemicals and all other related expenses directly
11 associated with mitigating or reclaiming waters affected as a result of a violation and direct
12 the offender to provide the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife proof of that
13 payment.
14 Current law requires a permit to transport live fish for breeding and advertising. The
15 bill eliminates the specific activities of breeding and advertising so the permit is required
16 more generally for transport of live fish except for live baitfish and smelts taken within the
17 State.
18 The bill creates a prohibition for disposal of live baitfish or smelts into inland waters,
19 which is a civil violation. It also changes references to gametes and fish spawn to fish eggs.
