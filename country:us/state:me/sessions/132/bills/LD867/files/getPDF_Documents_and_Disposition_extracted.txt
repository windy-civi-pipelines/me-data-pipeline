33 This subsection may not be construed to alter the terms of a pre-need insurance policy or
34 supersede any law governing the regulation of life insurance policies.
35 For the purposes of this subsection, "pre-need insurance" has the same meaning as in Title

18 service or plan that is arranged, planned or determined prior to the death of a person or
19 persons for whom the funeral service is to be performed. A funeral home, funeral
20 establishment or licensee under this chapter may enter into contracts or agreements for

23 prohibits the sale of pre-need insurance as defined in Title 24-A, section 711 and as set
24 forth in section 1401, subsection 1-B to a consumer who has contacted a funeral home to

29 or other similar facility for the purpose of soliciting a prearranged funeral service or
30 plan if that contact has been specifically requested by the individual;

35 service or plan, including the use of direct mail or other communication; and

38 purpose of soliciting a prearranged funeral service or plan.
39 3. Commission or gratuity for securing business prohibited. A funeral home,
40 funeral establishment or licensee under this chapter may not pay or cause to be paid,
41 directly or indirectly, any money or other thing of value to a person not responsible for
Page 5 - 132LR0695(01)
412 payment for the funeral as a commission or gratuity for the securing of business for the
423 funeral home, establishment or licensee.
3 4. Violation. Any person who violates this section is guilty of a Class E crime.

31 transfer of the funds, the recipient financial institution or credit union shall provide a
32 written confirmation of the deposit, including the amount deposited, to the payor or the
33 payor's legal representative.
34 D. The agreement must be in writing and a copy must be furnished to the payor or the

36 agreement may be revocable or irrevocable; however, if irrevocable, there must be a
37 provision to allow for the transfer of the account by the appointment of successor
38 trustees. The agreement must clearly state the name of the initial financial institution
39 or credit union into which the money will be deposited and must direct the payor to
40 send a copy of the agreement to the named financial institution or credit union. The

1 (1) Upon transfer of the account by the appointment of a successor trustee;
2 (2) Upon revocation of the agreement if the agreement is revocable; and
3 (3) For the actual financial and tax administration of the account.
4 The payee shall maintain a complete record of the deposit of all funds, including
5 principal and interest. The record must be available for inspection by the payor, the
6 payor's legal representative, the commissioner's designee or an inspector for the board
7 and must contain the name and address of the financial institution or credit union
8 currently in possession of the funds and the dates and amounts of deposits.
9 E. The funds may be directed by the payee to another financial institution or credit
10 union or directed back to the payor or the payor's legal representative, if otherwise
11 lawful and permitted by contract, on written instructions of the payor or the payor's
12 legal representative. The funds may only be withdrawn by the payee on presentation
13 of a certified copy of the death certificate of the person for whose benefit the funds
14 were paid, in which event they must be used in accordance with the agreement.
15 Sec. 6. 32 MRSA §1401, sub-§1-B is enacted to read:
16 1-B. Plan funded with proceeds of pre-need insurance policy. A prearranged
17 funeral service or plan may be funded with proceeds of a pre-need insurance policy in
18 accordance with this subsection.
19 A. During a person's lifetime, a person or that person's legal representative may enter
20 into an agreement that services will be performed or personal property will be delivered
21 in connection with the disposition of that person's body after death by the assignment
22 of proceeds of a pre-need insurance policy to the funeral establishment upon that
23 person's death.
24 B. The proceeds of a pre-need insurance policy may not exceed the maximum amount
25 of the goods and services that are contracted for in the prearranged funeral service or
26 plan agreement.
27 C. An agreement under paragraph A must be in writing and a copy must be furnished
28 to the person or the person's legal representative by the funeral establishment when the
29 agreement is executed. The agreement must identify the parties to the agreement and
30 must be signed by an authorized representative of the funeral establishment.
31 The receipt of a commission for the sale of pre-need insurance does not constitute a
32 violation of section 1455-B, subsection 5.
33 This subsection may not be construed to alter the terms of a pre-need insurance policy or
34 supersede any law governing the regulation of life insurance policies.
35 For the purposes of this subsection, "pre-need insurance" has the same meaning as in Title
36 24-A, section 711.

11 Sec. 8. 32 MRSA §1402, as amended by PL 1983, c. 413, §55, is repealed and the
12 following enacted in its place:
13 §1402. Solicitation of prearranged funerals and funeral business
14 1. Solicitation generally prohibited. Except as provided in subsection 2, a funeral
15 home, funeral establishment or person holding a license under this chapter may not as, or
16 through, an agent or principal solicit a prearranged funeral service or plan for any person
17 or persons. "Prearranged funeral service or plan" as used in this section means any funeral
18 service or plan that is arranged, planned or determined prior to the death of a person or
19 persons for whom the funeral service is to be performed. A funeral home, funeral
20 establishment or licensee under this chapter may enter into contracts or agreements for
21 prearranged funeral services or plans as long as they do not in any manner either as, or
22 through, principals or agents solicit such contract or agreement. Nothing in this section
23 prohibits the sale of pre-need insurance as defined in Title 24-A, section 711 and as set
24 forth in section 1401, subsection 1-B to a consumer who has contacted a funeral home to
25 prearrange a funeral.
26 2. Permitted contact and advertising. A funeral home, funeral establishment or
27 licensee under this chapter may:
28 A. Directly or indirectly contact an individual in a hospital, rest home, nursing home
29 or other similar facility for the purpose of soliciting a prearranged funeral service or
30 plan if that contact has been specifically requested by the individual;
31 B. Contact by telephone or visit a personal residence of an individual for the purpose
32 of soliciting a prearranged funeral service or plan if that contact or visit has been
33 requested by the individual or a family member residing at the residence;
34 C. Engage in general advertising for the purpose of soliciting a prearranged funeral
35 service or plan, including the use of direct mail or other communication; and
36 D. Solicit an individual who initiates discussion of a prearranged funeral service or
37 plan or who responds to a general advertisement or other communication made for the
38 purpose of soliciting a prearranged funeral service or plan.
39 3. Commission or gratuity for securing business prohibited. A funeral home,
40 funeral establishment or licensee under this chapter may not pay or cause to be paid,
41 directly or indirectly, any money or other thing of value to a person not responsible for
Page 5 - 132LR0695(01)

412 payment for the funeral as a commission or gratuity for the securing of business for the
423 funeral home, establishment or licensee.
3 4. Violation. Any person who violates this section is guilty of a Class E crime.
