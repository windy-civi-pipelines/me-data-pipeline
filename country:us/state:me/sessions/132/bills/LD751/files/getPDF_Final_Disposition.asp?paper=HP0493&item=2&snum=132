An Act to Amend the Hunting Laws Related to the Training of Dogs and
Open Training Seasons
Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, a provision of law allowing for the training of dogs to hunt bear in portions
of Washington County and Hancock County is due to be repealed on May 1, 2025; and
Whereas, allowing this provision to lapse could have implications for unwanted bear-
landowner interactions; and
Whereas, enactment of this legislation would continue to authorize the training of
dogs for bear hunting in portions of Washington County and Hancock County; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore,
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
Sec. 1. 12 MRSA §12051, sub-§1, ¶D, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 172, §1, is
amended to read:
D. Notwithstanding paragraph C, until May 1, 2025, in those portions of Washington
County and Hancock County that are situated south of Route 9, a resident may train up
to 6 dogs at any one time on bear from July 1st to the 4th day preceding the open season
on hunting bear except that permission is required to train dogs on land used for wild
blueberry production.
This paragraph is repealed May 1, 2025.
Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation
takes effect when approved.
