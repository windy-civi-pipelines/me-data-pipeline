26 A temporary license issued under this subsection is valid for the length of the term of the
27 license under subsection 5 or until a final determination on the Internet gaming license
28 application is made, whichever is sooner. If after investigation the director determines that
29 the applicant is eligible for an Internet gaming license under this chapter, the director shall
30 issue the initial Internet gaming license, at which time the temporary license terminates.

9 retained by the director for the costs of administering this chapter. In addition to the license
10 fee, the director may charge a processing fee for an initial or renewed license in an amount

19 application a request for a temporary license. A request for a temporary license must
20 include the initial license fee under subsection 4. If the director determines that the
21 applicant is qualified under subsection 1, meets the requirements established by rule for a
22 temporary license and has paid the initial license fee and the director is not aware of any
23 reason the applicant is ineligible for a license under this section, the director may issue a
24 temporary supplier license. A temporary license issued under this subsection is valid for
25 the length of the term of the license under subsection 5 or until a final determination on the
26 supplier license application is made, whichever is sooner. If after investigation the director
27 determines that the applicant is eligible for a supplier license under this chapter, the director

32 gaming equipment, systems and services sold or leased to, delivered to or offered to an
33 operator in this State as required by the director, all of which must be tested and approved

35 to use supplies acquired from a licensed supplier if the supplier's license subsequently
36 expires or is otherwise revoked, unless the director finds a defect in the supplies.
37 §1408. Management services license
38 1. Issuance of license; eligibility. The director shall issue a management services

42 conduct Internet gaming in accordance with this chapter and the rules adopted under this
43 chapter. The director shall by rule establish a process for issuance of a management

8 the written contract that has been approved by the director under this subsection. A
9 management services licensee may not transfer, assign, delegate or subcontract any portion
10 of the management services licensee's responsibilities under the contract or any portion of
11 the management services licensee's right to compensation under the contract to any other
12 person who does not hold a management services license.
13 4. Fees. The fee for an initial or renewed management services license is $10,000 and
14 must be retained by the director for the costs of administering this chapter. In addition to
15 the license fee, the director may charge a processing fee for an initial or renewed license in
16 an amount equal to the projected cost of processing the application and performing any
17 background investigations. If the actual cost exceeds the projected cost, an additional fee
18 may be charged to meet the actual cost. If the projected cost exceeds the actual cost, the
19 difference may be refunded to the applicant or licensee.
20 5. Term of license. Except as provided in subsection 6, a license granted or renewed
21 under this section is valid for one year unless sooner revoked by the director or the
22 commissioner under section 1405.
23 6. Temporary license. An applicant for a management services license may submit
24 with the application a request for a temporary license. A request for a temporary license
25 must include the initial license fee under subsection 4. If the director determines that the
26 applicant is qualified under subsection 1, meets the requirements established by rule for a
27 temporary license and has paid the initial license fee and the director is not aware of any
28 reason the applicant is ineligible for a license under this section, the director may issue a
29 temporary management services license. A temporary license issued under this subsection
30 is valid for the length of the term of the license under subsection 5 or until a final
31 determination on the management services license application is made, whichever is
32 sooner. If after investigation the director determines that the applicant is eligible for a
33 management services license under this chapter, the director shall issue the initial
34 management services license, at which time the temporary license terminates. The initial
35 management services license is valid for one year from the date that the temporary license
36 was issued by the director.
37 §1409. Occupational license
38 1. License required. A person may not be employed by an operator to be engaged

40 gaming without a valid occupational license issued by the director under this section. The
41 director shall issue an occupational license to a person who meets the requirements of this
42 section, section 1404 and section 1405. The director shall by rule establish a process for
43 issuance of occupational licenses that is, to the extent practicable, identical to the process
44 for occupational licenses issued under section 1210 and for licensing employees of a casino
45 under section 1015.
Page 11 - 132LR2128(01)
1 2. Authority to be employed in Internet gaming. An occupational license authorizes
2 the licensee to be employed by an operator in the capacity designated by the director while

4 requirements to recognize the extent to which a particular job has the ability to affect the
5 proper operation of Internet gaming.

7 any required application forms established by the director and pay a nonrefundable

19 gaming event, and the entity represents to the director that it specifically uses that data for
20 the purpose of monitoring the integrity of the Internet gaming event, an operator shall share,
21 in a commercially reasonable frequency, form and manner, with the entity or its designee
22 the same information the operator is required to maintain under subsection 2 with respect

Page 6 - 132LR2128(01)

23 purposes of this paragraph, "financial responsibility" means a demonstration of a
24 current and expected future condition of financial solvency sufficient to satisfy the

30 practices;
31 H. If the applicant or licensee has not met the requirements of this chapter; or

40 application for a license or for renewal of a license. If the applicant or licensee makes a
41 timely request for a hearing, the commissioner shall conduct an adjudicatory hearing in
42 accordance with Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 4. The director's decision to deny the
Page 7 - 132LR2128(01)

413 license or license renewal stands until the commissioner issues a decision to uphold, modify
424 or overrule the director's decision.
3 After hearing, if the commissioner finds grounds for denying a license or license renewal
4 under subsection 1, the commissioner may deny the application for a license or for renewal
5 of a license.

17 complaint is true and is of sufficient gravity to warrant further action, the commissioner
18 may impose an administrative sanction under subsection 4.

20 subsection 3, impose the following administrative sanctions on a licensee:
