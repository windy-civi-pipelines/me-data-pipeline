26 year in which the adjustment is effective and "Chained Consumer Price Index" has the same
27 meaning as in Title 36, section 5402, subsection 1.

35 2026-27, the commissioner shall, in accordance with this subsection, increase the state
36 share of the total allocation to a qualifying school administrative unit by an amount
37 necessary to achieve the minimum salary for certified teachers and career and technical
38 education teachers established in section 13407 13408.

20 teachers. Qualifying school administrative units shall use the payments provided
21 under this subsection to provide salary adjustments to those certified teachers and
22 career and technical education teachers eligible for incremental salary increases.
23 The department shall collect the necessary data to allow the funds to be included
24 in a qualifying school administrative unit's monthly subsidy payments beginning
25 no later than February 1st of each fiscal year.
