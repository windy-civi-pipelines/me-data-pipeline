2 executive branch departments and agencies.

22 the TransCap Trust Fund for revenue bond debt service and underwriting requirements.

24 related to automobiles transferred to the Highway Fund as revenue streams so that bond
25 proceeds can be used for all highway, bridge and multimodal transportation capital
26 projects. This Part also eliminates the transfer of the portion of registration fees that went
27 to the TransCap Trust Fund.
28 PART G
29 This Part provides that the unexpended Highway Fund account balances for
