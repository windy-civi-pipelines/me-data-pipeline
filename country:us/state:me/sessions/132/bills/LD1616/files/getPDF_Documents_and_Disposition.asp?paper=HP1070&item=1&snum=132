33 SUMMARY
3344 This bill eliminates requirements for an individual whose license has been temporarily

3366 keep the individual's primary identity documentation in the individual's possession. The
3377 bill also eliminates provisions establishing crimes and traffic infractions associated with
3388 display or possession of a suspended driver's license.
