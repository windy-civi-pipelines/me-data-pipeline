household incomes of less than 30% of the median income for the area as defined by the

Housing Act of 1937, Public Law 75-412, 50 Stat. 888, Section 8, as amended.
2. Administration. The Maine State Housing Authority shall delegate administration
of the program and provide appropriate funding to one or more of the following: a
designated community action agency as described by Title 22, section 5324; a municipal
housing authority; or any other qualified entity as determined by the Maine State Housing
Authority, including but not limited to a community-based organization. An entity
delegated to administer the program must demonstrate experience as an administrator of
similar programs and have the ability to provide job-seeking assistance to renters who
benefit from the program. An entity delegated to administer the program shall develop a
method of verifying a person's eligibility for rental assistance every 6 months after initial
approval. An entity delegated to administer the program shall limit administrative costs to
10% or less of an allocation received from the fund and keep the total cost of program
delivery and administrative costs to 25% or less of an allocation received from the fund.

3. Program delivery and operations. The program must include funding and
capacity for adequate staffing to support program delivery and operations, facilitate
wraparound and navigation services and provide essential stability and case management
critical to the success of program participants. An entity delegated to administer the
program must be capable of serving a diverse population, including persons with limited
proficiency in the English language and from a wide range of cultural backgrounds, and
must possess demonstrated experience administering similar programs, including
supplemental rental assistance and housing navigation programs. Staff members must
substantially participate in ensuring equitable access and program compliance and in
connecting renters with broader supports that promote long-term housing stability and
workforce participation.
4. Form and amount of assistance. Assistance provided under the program is limited
to $3,000 per household per calendar year. Assistance must be paid directly to the program
participant's landlord in an amount not to exceed $300 per month, except when the
assistance payment is for a security deposit required for a new lease or rental agreement.
5. Eligibility. A person eligible for assistance under the program must:
A. At the time of application, earn less than 30% of the median income for the area as
defined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development under
the United States Housing Act of 1937, Public Law 75-412, 50 Stat. 888, Section 8, as
amended;
B. At the time of application, not be using a federal housing voucher to pay rent or live
