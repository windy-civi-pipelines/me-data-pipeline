14 online instruction to enrolled students;
15 4. Partner with law firms, businesses and community organizations to provide local
16 mentoring, internship and employment opportunities for enrolled students; and
17 5. Be funded through a self-sustaining model that combines tuition revenue, including
18 tuition payments from students enrolled in the program, with funding partnerships with
19 local law firms, businesses and community organizations and any grants, private donations
20 or state or federal funding available to support the implementation and operation of the
21 program.
22 No later than January 1, 2026, the University of Maine System shall submit a report to
23 the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs outlining its plan for
24 implementation of the program at the University of Maine School of Law by the beginning

26 description of the rules, policies and procedures necessary for program implementation; a
27 detailed timeline for program implementation, including development, faculty recruitment
28 and student enrollment; an estimated budget for the program and identified funding
29 strategies for ensuring program sustainability; and recommendations for necessary
30 legislative or other action, including proposed legislation. After reviewing the report, the
31 committee may report out legislation related to the report to the Second Regular Session of
32 the 132nd Legislature.
