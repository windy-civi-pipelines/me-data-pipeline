12 'Sec. 8. Maine Comments. Comments submitted by the Probate and Trust Law

18 SUMMARY
1199 This amendment acknowledges the following Maine Comments to the Maine Uniform
2200 Probate Code, as amended by the bill, that were submitted by the Probate and Trust Law
2211 Advisory Commission.
22 Maine Comment for Title 18-C, section 2-201, sub-§3
23 The definition of "marriage" is consistent with the Maine Uniform Probate Code's
24 definition of "spouse" and, as such, the definition clarifies that a surviving registered
25 domestic partner and a surviving member of a legal union that was validly formed in any
26 state or jurisdiction and that provides substantially the same rights, benefits and
27 responsibilities as a marriage, have elective share rights under Part 2 of Article 2 of the
28 Maine Uniform Probate Code.
29 Maine Comment for Title 18-C, section 3-108, sub-§1, ¶D
30 Section 3-108(D) prohibits the presentation of claims other than expenses of
31 administration. The homestead allowance (§2-402), exempt property (§2-403), and the
32 family allowance (§2-404) are all referred to under Part 4 of Article 2 as "rights" and as

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 949, L.D. 1440
313 payments to which a surviving spouse or minor dependent children are "entitled." As such,
324 the homestead allowance, exempt property, and the family allowance are not properly
335 classified as claims. However, because a personal representative appointed under
346 §3-108(D) "has no right to possess estate assets . . . beyond that necessary to confirm title
357 in the successors to the estate," the section now makes clear that the homestead allowance,
368 exempt property, and the family allowance are not intended to be, and should not be, paid
379 by a personal representative appointed under §3-108(D).
8 Maine Comment for Title 18-C, section 3-203, sub-§1, ¶E
9 A non-registered domestic partner is removed from the list of persons with priority for
10 appointment as personal representative.
11 Maine Comment for Title 18-C, section 9-202, sub-§9
12 Section 9-202(8) requires a parent who is outside the State of Maine to provide a
13 surrender and release or a consent by appearing before a court of comparable jurisdiction
14 in the state where the parent resides (temporarily or permanently). However, some states
15 do not require that a surrender and release or a consent be signed after appearing before a
16 court. Rather, some states merely require that the surrender and release or consent be signed
17 before a notary. As a result, a parent, who resides in a state that does not have a court
18 procedure for advising the parent of the consequences of the surrender and release or
19 consent, faced an impediment that previous Maine law did not accommodate.
20 Section 9-202(9) provides a procedure for a parent who resides outside the State of
21 Maine to provide a surrender and release or a consent that complies with Maine law when
22 the law of the state where the parent resides does not have a procedure that enables the
23 parent to comply with the requirements of §9-202(8). The parent may, after motion and
24 approval by the Maine court with jurisdiction over the proceeding, appear before the Maine
25 court by videoconference for approval of the parent's surrender and release or consent.
