1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 24-A MRSA ยง4320-W is enacted to read:
3 ยง4320-W. Coverage for blood testing for PFAS
4 1. Definition. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates,
5 "perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances" or "PFAS" means any member of the class
6 of fluorinated organic chemicals containing at least one fully fluorinated carbon atom.
7 2. Required coverage. A carrier offering a health plan in this State shall provide
8 coverage for blood testing for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances that is
9 recommended by a provider as medically necessary health care for an enrollee. For the
10 purposes of this subsection, blood testing for PFAS is presumed to be medically necessary
11 health care for an enrollee if a provider determines that the enrollee meets clinical
12 guidelines for blood testing for PFAS established by the National Academies of Sciences,
13 Engineering, and Medicine, its successor organization or a comparable organization.
14 3. Cost sharing prohibited. A health plan may not impose any deductible,
15 copayment, coinsurance or other cost-sharing requirement for the costs of blood testing
16 required to be covered under subsection 2. This subsection does not apply to a health plan
17 offered for use with a health savings account unless the federal Internal Revenue Service
18 determines that the requirements in this subsection are permissible in a high deductible
19 health plan as defined in the federal Internal Revenue Code, Section 223(c)(2).
20 Sec. 2. Expansion of the State's essential health benefits; legislative finding.
21 The Legislature finds that the requirements of this Act to provide coverage for blood testing
22 for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances for the purposes of appropriate
23 management or ongoing monitoring of a disease or condition when supported by medical
24 and scientific evidence are not an expansion of the State's essential health benefits and do
25 not require defrayal of costs by the State pursuant to 42 United States Code, Section
26 18031(d)(3)(B) because the State's essential health benefits currently include coverage for
27 outpatient laboratory services.
28 Sec. 3. Application. This Act applies to all policies, contracts and certificates
29 executed, delivered, issued for delivery, continued or renewed in this State on or after
30 January 1, 2026. For purposes of this Act, all contracts are deemed to be renewed no later
31 than the next yearly anniversary of the contract date.
32 SUMMARY
3333 This bill requires carriers offering health plans in this State to provide coverage for
3344 blood testing for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, recommended
3355 by a provider as medically necessary health care in accordance with clinical guidelines
3366 established by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The
3377 requirements of the bill apply to health plans issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2026.
3388 The bill also includes language stating the Legislature's finding that the requirement for
3399 coverage for blood testing for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances are not an
4400 expansion of the State's essential health benefits and do not require the State to defray costs
4411 pursuant to the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
