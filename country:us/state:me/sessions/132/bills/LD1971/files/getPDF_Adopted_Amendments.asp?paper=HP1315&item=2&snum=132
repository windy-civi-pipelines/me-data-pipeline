1 2. Clarifies that this legislation does not prohibit state and local law enforcement from
2 conducting investigative and enforcement duties as part of a joint law enforcement task

7 drug trafficking or human trafficking;

10 interview the individual is supported by a valid court order;
11 4. Clarifies that a state or local law enforcement agency may not detain a person solely
12 on the basis of a hold request and provides that, when it receives a hold request, a state or
13 local law enforcement agency is required to provide a copy of the request to the inmate and
14 inform the inmate that the agency is prohibited by law from detaining the person based
15 solely on the hold request;
16 5. Removes the provision of the bill that prohibits state and local law enforcement
17 agencies from providing office space within a law enforcement agency facility for use by
18 an immigration authority;
19 6. Removes the provision of the bill that prohibits state employees from inquiring about
20 a person’s immigration status unless the inquiry is necessary for the determination of
21 program, service or benefit eligibility or is required by federal or state law or by court order;
22 and
23 7. Streamlines the record-keeping requirements of the bill and requires that a law
24 enforcement agency make reasonable efforts to retain a copy of a hold request or other
25 request along with accompanying information and documentation from an immigration
26 authority for a period of 4 years, rather than indefinitely as in the bill.
