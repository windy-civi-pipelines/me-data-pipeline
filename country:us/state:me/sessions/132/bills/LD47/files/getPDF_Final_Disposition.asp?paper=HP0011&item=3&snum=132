An Act to Provide an Exception to a Fishing Prohibition near the Crooked
Brook Dam
Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, residents of the Town of Danforth in Washington County have long enjoyed
fishing in the area around Crooked Brook Dam; and
Whereas, since the completion of a fishway at the site of the dam, residents' ability to
fish has been limited; and
Whereas, this legislation creates an exception to allow fishing near, but not in or from,
the fishway; and
Whereas, it is important that this legislation take effect immediately so that residents
of the Town of Danforth can enjoy fishing in the spring and summer months; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore,
