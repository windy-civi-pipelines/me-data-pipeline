32 SUMMARY
3333 This bill amends several provisions related to the licensing and regulation of various
3344 medical and social service entities by the Department of Health and Human Services.
35 Part A of the bill amends provisions related to the issuance of conditional licenses to
36 applicants seeking licensure for a personal care agency; a facility for children and adults
37 under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, chapter 1663; the provision of mental health
38 services; and an agency that provides services to adults with intellectual disabilities, autism
39 spectrum disorder, a related condition or an acquired brain injury. Part A also amends the
40 law governing licensure for the provision of mental health services to require the
Page 7 - 132LR0258(01)
411 department to monitor for compliance every 2 years, rather than once a year, regardless of
422 the license term.
3 Part A of the bill also updates terms related to the licensing of health care facilities
4 under Title 22, chapter 405; expands the definition of "facility" under Title 22, Subtitle 6,
5 which concerns facilities for children and adults; clarifies the definition of "independent
6 housing with services program" under the laws governing assisted housing facilities; and
7 removes the requirement that the department must approve any employee assistance
8 program for substance use.
9 Part B of the bill amends the law governing health care facility reporting of sentinel
10 events by clarifying which health care facilities are required to comply with sentinel event
11 reporting requirements; expanding the types of events that must be reported as sentinel
12 events; removing the requirement to report a so-called near miss where a sentinel event
13 almost occurred; and making other changes and clarifications with respect to the reporting
14 and review process.
15 Part C of the bill amends the provisions of law governing the Maine Registry of
16 Certified Nursing Assistants and Direct Care Workers to resolve conflicts created by the
17 concurrent passage of Public Law 2023, chapter 241 and Public Law 2023, chapter 309.

32 SUMMARY
3333 This bill amends several provisions related to the licensing and regulation of various
3344 medical and social service entities by the Department of Health and Human Services.
35 Part A of the bill amends provisions related to the issuance of conditional licenses to
36 applicants seeking licensure for a personal care agency; a facility for children and adults
37 under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, chapter 1663; the provision of mental health
38 services; and an agency that provides services to adults with intellectual disabilities, autism
39 spectrum disorder, a related condition or an acquired brain injury. Part A also amends the
40 law governing licensure for the provision of mental health services to require the
Page 7 - 132LR0258(01)

411 department to monitor for compliance every 2 years, rather than once a year, regardless of
422 the license term.
3 Part A of the bill also updates terms related to the licensing of health care facilities
4 under Title 22, chapter 405; expands the definition of "facility" under Title 22, Subtitle 6,
5 which concerns facilities for children and adults; clarifies the definition of "independent
6 housing with services program" under the laws governing assisted housing facilities; and
7 removes the requirement that the department must approve any employee assistance
8 program for substance use.
9 Part B of the bill amends the law governing health care facility reporting of sentinel
10 events by clarifying which health care facilities are required to comply with sentinel event
11 reporting requirements; expanding the types of events that must be reported as sentinel
12 events; removing the requirement to report a so-called near miss where a sentinel event
13 almost occurred; and making other changes and clarifications with respect to the reporting
14 and review process.
15 Part C of the bill amends the provisions of law governing the Maine Registry of
16 Certified Nursing Assistants and Direct Care Workers to resolve conflicts created by the
17 concurrent passage of Public Law 2023, chapter 241 and Public Law 2023, chapter 309.
