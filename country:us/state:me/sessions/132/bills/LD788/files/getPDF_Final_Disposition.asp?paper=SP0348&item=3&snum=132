average each year thereafter. By December 1st of each year, the council shall submit an
annual accountability update that summarizes the State's aggregate commitment to research
and development investments and provides data on the commercialization of laboratory-
based innovation projects that occurred in the most recently available year to the Governor
and the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over research and
economic development matters and the joint standing committee of the Legislature having
jurisdiction over appropriations and financial affairs.
After reviewing the annual accountability update, the joint standing committee of the
Legislature having jurisdiction over research and economic development matters and the
joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over appropriations and
financial affairs may each report out legislation to implement any recommendations
contained in the update or to address any other issues identified in the update.
