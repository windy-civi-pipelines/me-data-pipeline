commissioner may transfer a prisoner committed to the department from a correctional
facility to supervised community confinement without meeting the eligibility requirements
of subsection 2, paragraphs B and C and without meeting the criteria or fulfilling the
process provided for under subsection subsections 2‑A and 2-B if the department's director
of medical care has determined that the prisoner has a terminal or severely incapacitating
medical condition or has a worsening prognosis that is likely to result in a terminal or
severely incapacitating medical condition and that care outside a correctional facility is
medically appropriate. Except as set out in this subsection, the prisoner must live in a
hospital or other appropriate care facility, such as a nursing facility, residential care facility
or a facility that is a licensed hospice program pursuant to Title 22, section 8622, approved
by the commissioner. As approved by the commissioner, the prisoner may receive hospice
services from an entity licensed pursuant to Title 22, chapter 1681, subchapter 1 or other
care services provided by an entity approved by the commissioner and, subject to approval
by the commissioner, may live at home while receiving these services. The commissioner
may exempt a prisoner transferred to supervised community confinement pursuant to this
subsection from any mandatory condition under subsection 3 that the commissioner
determines to be inapplicable. The prisoner shall provide any information pertaining to the
prisoner's medical condition or care that is requested by the commissioner at any time while
the prisoner is on supervised community confinement. If the commissioner determines that
the prisoner has failed to fully comply with a request or if at any time the department's
director of medical care determines that the prisoner does not have a terminal or severely
incapacitating medical condition or a worsening prognosis that is likely to result in a
terminal or severely incapacitating medical condition or that care outside a correctional
facility is not medically appropriate, the commissioner shall revoke the transfer to
supervised community confinement.
