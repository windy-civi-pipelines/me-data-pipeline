3 amended to read:
4 1-A. Manufacture of products not containing cannabis. Notwithstanding
5 subsection 1, a products manufacturing facility licensee that also has a license issued from
6 the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry pursuant to subsection 10 may
7 manufacture for sale or distribution any products that the facility is authorized to
8 manufacture or distribute pursuant to the provisions of that license, including products that
9 do not contain cannabis, except that a products manufacturing facility licensee is prohibited
10 from extracting hemp as defined in Title 7, section 2231, subsection 1‑A, paragraph D or
11 manufacturing products that contain hemp or ingredients derived from hemp that do not
12 also contain cannabis. Nothing in this This subsection may not be construed to prohibit a
13 products manufacturing facility licensee from using ingredients derived from hemp, as
14 defined in Title 7, section 2231, subsection 1-A, paragraph D, in the manufacture of
15 cannabis products or simultaneously using manufacturing-related equipment, supplies and
16 facilities for the manufacturing of cannabis products and hemp products.
17 A. A products manufacturing facility licensee that manufactures adult use cannabis
18 and adult use cannabis products within the same facility in which the licensee also
19 manufactures products that do not contain cannabis must comply with all applicable
20 requirements of this chapter and the rules adopted pursuant to this chapter concerning
21 the operation of products manufacturing facilities.
22 B. The following items or areas within the facility may be shared for both the
23 manufacturing of adult use cannabis and adult use cannabis products and the
24 manufacturing of products that do not contain cannabis:
25 (1) Manufacturing-related and nonmanufacturing-related equipment and supplies,
26 except that manufacturing-related equipment and supplies may not be
27 simultaneously used for the manufacturing of adult use cannabis and adult use
28 cannabis products and the manufacturing of products that do not contain cannabis;
29 (2) Manufacturing-related and nonmanufacturing-related supplies or products that
30 do not contain cannabis or cannabis products and the storage areas for those
31 supplies or products; and
32 (3) General office space, bathrooms, entryways and walkways.
33 C. A products manufacturing facility licensee must ensure that:
34 (1) Manufacturing-related equipment and supplies are not simultaneously used for
35 the manufacturing of cannabis and cannabis products and the manufacturing of
36 products that do not contain cannabis;
37 (2) Manufacturing-related equipment is sanitized between the manufacturing of
38 cannabis and cannabis products and the manufacturing of products that do not
39 contain cannabis;
40 (3) Cannabis and cannabis products are kept separate from products that do not
41 contain cannabis;

1 (4) Cannabis and cannabis products are packaged and labeled accurately pursuant
2 to the requirements of this chapter and the rules adopted pursuant to this chapter;
3 (5) Products that do not contain cannabis are packaged and labeled accurately
4 pursuant to the provisions of the license issued by another department to
5 manufacture products that do not contain cannabis; and
6 (6) Any person manufacturing products that do not contain cannabis in a licensed
7 manufacturing facility obtains an individual identification card from the office
8 pursuant to section 106, except that the person is not required to submit to a
9 criminal history record check.
10 Sec. 2. 28-B MRSA §605, sub-§4, as amended by PL 2023, c. 679, Pt. B, §120, is
11 further amended to read:
12 4. No subsequent processing, manufacturing or alteration. Since the performance
13 of the prior testing under subsection 1, the cannabis or cannabis product has not undergone
14 any further processing, manufacturing or alteration that would result in an increase in the
15 concentration of any contaminants or factors identified in section 602, subsection 1 or in
16 any rules adopted by the office pursuant to that section. For purposes of this subsection,
17 further processing, manufacturing or alteration does not include the use of a cannabis
18 extract or distillate in the creation of a baked good or other edible cannabis product, except
19 for testing under section 602, subsection 1, paragraph F.
20 SUMMARY
2211 This bill removes the prohibition of simultaneously using manufacturing-related
2222 equipment, supplies and facilities for the manufacturing of cannabis and cannabis products
2233 and the manufacturing of hemp products and clarifies that the further processing,
2244 manufacturing or alteration of cannabis or cannabis products does not include the use of a
2255 cannabis extract or distillate in the creation of a baked good or other edible cannabis
2266 product except for potency, homogeneity and cannabinoid profiles.
