71 On an annual basis, municipalities and publicly owned treatment works whose
82 combined sewer overflows have the potential to affect shellfish harvesting areas as
93 determined by the department by virtue of their locations within estuarine or marine
104 waters of the State must be assessed a surcharge on their wastewater discharge licenses
115 in a total amount of $12,000. This amount must be allocated among the municipalities
126 and publicly owned treatment works according to their prior 3-year average annual
137 flows as reported to the department.
14 On an annual basis, publicly owned treatment works whose outfalls licensed for the
15 discharge of treated effluent cause adjacent shellfish growing areas to be closed for the
16 purposes of harvesting shellfish must be assessed a license surcharge in a total amount
17 of $25,000. This amount must be allocated among the publicly owned treatment works
18 according to the acreage that each licensed outfall closes. This acreage must be
19 determined by the Department of Marine Resources in consultation with the
20 department.
21 SUMMARY
2222 This bill adds marine finfish aquaculture facilities and general permit coverage for
2233 municipal separate storm sewer systems as waste discharge license groups and establishes
2244 the basis for the annual fees for those license groups. It changes the basis for the annual
2255 fee for the general permit coverage for the marine aquaculture facilities waste discharge
2266 license group and increases the median fee for that license group. It also clarifies that the
2277 fish-rearing facility waste discharge license group covers terrestrial fish-rearing facilities.
