4 5. Subdivision. A "subdivision" is "Subdivision" means the division of a parcel of
5 land into 5 or more lots to be offered for sale or lease to the general public during any 5-
6 year period, if the aggregate land area includes more than 20 acres; except that when all
7 lots are for single-family, detached, residential housing designed to accommodate up to 4
8 families, common areas or open space a, "subdivision" is means the division of a parcel of
9 land into 15 or more lots to be offered for sale or lease to the general public within any 5-
10 year period, if the aggregate land area includes more than 30 acres. Detached residential
11 housing may include accessory dwelling units in accordance with Title 30-A, section
12 4364-B. The aggregate land area includes lots to be offered together with the roads,
13 common areas, easement areas and all portions of the parcel of land in which rights or
14 interests, whether express or implied, are to be offered. This definition of "subdivision" is
15 subject to the following exceptions:
16 C. Lots of 40 or more acres but not more than 500 acres may not be counted as lots
17 except where:
18 (1) The proposed subdivision is located wholly or partly within the shoreland zone;
19 C-1. Lots of more than 500 acres in size may not be counted as lots;
20 D. Five years after a subdivider establishes a single-family residence for that
21 subdivider's own use on a parcel and actually uses all or part of the parcel for that
22 purpose during that period, a lot containing that residence may not be counted as a lot;
23 E. Unless intended to circumvent this article, the following transactions may not be
24 considered lots offered for sale or lease to the general public:
25 (1) Sale or lease of lots to an abutting owner or to a spouse, child, parent,
26 grandparent or sibling of the developer if those lots are not further divided or
27 transferred to a person not so related to the developer within a 5-year period, except
28 as provided in this subsection;
29 (2) Personal, nonprofit transactions, such as the transfer of lots by gift, if those lots
30 are not further divided or transferred within a 5-year period, or the transfer of lots
31 by devise or inheritance; or
32 (3) Grant of a bona fide security interest in the whole lot or subsequent transfer of
33 the whole lot by the original holder of the bona fide security interest or that person's
34 successor in interest;
35 F. In those subdivisions that would otherwise not require site location approval, unless
36 intended to circumvent this article, the following transactions may not, except as
37 provided, be considered lots offered for sale or lease to the general public:
38 (1) Sale or lease of common lots created with a conservation easement as defined

413 as the land was not owned by the permit holder at the time the department approved
424 the subdivision. Further division of the transferred land must be reviewed under this
435 article.
4 The exception described in paragraph F does not apply, and the subdivision requires site
5 location approval, whenever the use of a lot described in paragraph F changes or the lot is
6 offered for sale or lease to the general public without the limitations set forth in paragraph
7 F. For the purposes of this subsection only, a "parcel of land is defined as" means all
8 contiguous land in the same ownership provided except that lands located on opposite sides
9 of a public or private road are considered each a separate parcel of land unless that road
10 was established by the owner of land on both sides of the road subsequent to January 1,
11 1970. A lot to be offered for sale or lease to the general public is counted, for purposes of
12 determining jurisdiction, from the time a municipal subdivision plan showing that lot is
13 recorded or the lot is sold or leased, whichever occurs first, until 5 years after that recording,
14 sale or lease.
15 Sec. 2. 38 MRSA §488, sub-§17, as amended by PL 1997, c. 393, Pt. A, §45, is
16 further amended to read:

21 for purposes of determining jurisdiction. Detached residential housing may include
22 accessory dwelling units in accordance with Title 30-A, section 4364-B. A road associated
23 only with such lots is also not counted toward the 3-acre threshold. For purposes of this
24 subsection, "single-family residential housing" does not include multi-unit housing such as
25 condominiums and apartment buildings.

Page 2 - 132LR0167(01)

416 municipality in which the development is located or an adjacent municipality may petition
427 the commissioner to review such a structure or subdivision if it has regional environmental
438 impacts. This petition must be filed within 20 days of the receipt of the application by the
449 municipality. State jurisdiction must be exerted, if at all, within 30 days of receipt of the
550 completed project application by the commissioner from the municipality or within 30 days
561 of receipt of any modification to that application from the municipality. Review by the
572 department is limited to the identified regional environmental impacts. The criteria are as
583 follows:
9 A. A municipal planning board or reviewing authority is established and the
10 municipality has adequate resources to administer and enforce the provisions of its
11 ordinances. In determining whether this criterion is met, the commissioner may
12 consider any specific and adequate technical assistance that is provided by a regional
13 council;
14 B. The municipality has adopted a site plan review ordinance. In determining the
15 adequacy of the ordinance, the commissioner may consider model site plan review
16 ordinances commonly used by municipalities in this State that address the issues
17 reviewed under applicable provisions of this article prior to July 1, 1997;
18 C. The municipality has adopted subdivision regulations. In determining the adequacy
19 of these regulations, the commissioner may consider model subdivision regulations
20 commonly used by municipalities in this State; and
21 D. The former State Planning Office or the Department of Agriculture, Conservation
22 and Forestry has determined that the municipality has a comprehensive land use plan
23 and land use ordinances or zoning ordinances that are consistent with Title 30‑A,
24 chapter 187 in providing for the protection of wildlife habitat, fisheries, unusual natural
25 areas and archaeological and historic sites.
26 The department, in consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and
27 Forestry, shall publish a list of those municipalities determined to have capacity pursuant
28 to this subsection. This list need not be established by rule and must be published by
29 January 1st of each year. The list must specify whether a municipality has capacity to
30 review structures or subdivisions of lots for single-family, detached, residential housing
31 designed to accommodate up to 4 families, common areas or open space or both types of
32 development. Detached residential housing may include accessory dwelling units in
33 accordance with Title 30-A, section 4364-B. The department may recognize joint
34 arrangements among municipalities and regional organizations in determining whether the
35 requirements of this subsection are met. The department may review municipalities that
36 are determined to have capacity pursuant to this subsection for compliance with the criteria
37 in paragraphs A to D, and if the department determines that a municipality does not meet
38 the criteria, the department may modify or remove the determination of capacity.
39 A modification to a development that was reviewed by a municipality and exempted
40 pursuant to this subsection or was reviewed by the department prior to a determination that
41 a municipality has capacity pursuant to this subsection is exempt as long as the modification
42 will not cause the total area of the development to exceed the maximum acreage specified
43 in this subsection for that type of development or, based upon information submitted by the
44 municipality concerning the development and modification, the department determines that
45 the modification may be adequately reviewed by the municipality.

1 Sec. 5. 38 MRSA §489-E, as repealed and replaced by PL 2011, c. 359, §4, is
2 amended to read:
3 §489-E. Rulemaking
4 Rules adopted by the department pursuant to this article are routine technical rules, as
5 defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A, including rules to establish a permit by rule
6 option in accordance with section 344, subsection 7, except that rules adopted by the
7 department after January 1, 2010 pursuant to section 484, subsections 1, 3, 4, 4‑A, 5, 6 and
8 7 are major substantive rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.
9 SUMMARY
1100 This bill amends the definition of "subdivision" for purposes of the site location of
1111 development laws to allow lots that include detached residential housing designed to
1122 accommodate up to 4 families, including accessory dwelling units, instead of just
1133 single-family housing. This bill also specifies that rules made by the Board of
1144 Environmental Protection to permit, by rule, any class of activities that would otherwise
1155 require individual issuance of a permit or approval by the board are routine technical rules.
