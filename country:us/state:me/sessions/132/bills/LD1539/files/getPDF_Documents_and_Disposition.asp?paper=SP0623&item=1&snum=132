31 SUMMARY
3322 This bill creates the State Employee Compensation Stabilization Fund within the

3344 salaries of state employees to provide parity between the salaries of state employees and
3355 the salaries of comparable positions in the public and private sectors as determined by a
3366 market pay study. Unexpended balances in the fund at the end of the fiscal year do not
3377 lapse and are carried forward to the next fiscal year. "State employees," as used in the bill,
