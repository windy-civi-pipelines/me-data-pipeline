13 Sec. 2. 32 MRSA §14037, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2005, c. 518, §8, is amended
14 to read:
15 1. Scope of license. For federally related transactions, a residential real property
16 appraiser license entitles the holder to appraise noncomplex residential property of one to
17 4 units having a transaction value of less than $1,000,000 and complex residential property
18 of one to 4 units having a transaction value of less than $250,000 $400,000. For purposes
19 of this section, "complex residential property of one to 4 units" means property that is
20 atypical based on the nature of the property, the form of ownership or the market
21 conditions. For nonfederally related transaction appraisals, "transaction value" means
22 market value. A residential real property appraiser license entitles the holder to appraise
23 vacant or unimproved land that is used for one to 4 family purposes or for which the highest
24 and best use is for one to 4 family purposes. A residential real property appraiser license
25 does not entitle the holder to appraise subdivisions for which a development analysis and
26 appraisal is necessary.
27 Sec. 3. Transition. Notwithstanding the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 32, section
28 14011, subsection 2, a member of the Board of Real Estate Appraisers serving on the
29 effective date of this Act continues to serve until the expiration of that member's term.

3322 Appraisers. It also amends the scope of license provisions for residential real property
3333 appraisers.
