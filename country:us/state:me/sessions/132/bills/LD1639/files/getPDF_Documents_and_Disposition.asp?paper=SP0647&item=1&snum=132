6 For purposes of this section, "instructional hours" means hours during the school day during
7 which students are engaged in regularly scheduled instruction, educational activities or
8 academic programs under the supervision of school staff. Instructional hours do not include
9 extracurricular activities, lunchtime or recess. Time spent on an organized field trip related

11 counted for a field trip may not exceed a regular school day for each day of the field trip.
12 Instructional hours include educational activities provided outside of the regular school day

15 2. Waivers. The commissioner may grant a waiver to a school administrative unit for
16 a school to be exempted from the minimum instructional hours requirement under
17 subsection 1 for extraordinary circumstances, including but not limited to natural disasters,
18 public health emergencies and other unforeseen events that significantly disrupt school
19 operations. A school administrative unit requesting a waiver under this subsection must
20 submit a written application to the department that details the circumstances and a proposed
21 plan to address the loss of instructional hours.
22 3. Compliance and reporting. A school administrative unit shall submit an annual
23 report to the department certifying that the school administrative unit is in compliance with
24 the requirements of this section. The department shall monitor compliance and may take
25 corrective action, including withholding state subsidies, for noncompliance.
26 4. Rules. The department shall adopt rules to implement this section. Rules adopted
27 pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375,
28 subchapter 2-A.
29 Sec. 2. Application. This Act applies to all school administrative units in the State
30 beginning with the 2026-2027 school year.
