3. Ability to contract. A direct primary health care service agreement is an agreement
between the direct primary health care provider and either an individual or the individual's
representative, regardless of whether the periodic fee or other fees are paid by the

services specified in the agreement. Any goods or services that are not covered by the

insurance and that the fees charged in the agreement may not be reimbursed or apply
towards a deductible under a health insurance policy with an insurer.

Section 8:
6. Other care not prohibited. A primary health care provider is considered a direct

contract with an insurer.

enrollee's health plan based solely on the basis that the enrollee's referral was made by a
direct primary health care provider who is not a member of the carrier's provider network.
A carrier may not apply a deductible, coinsurance or copayment greater than the applicable
deductible, coinsurance or copayment that would apply to the same health care service if
the service was referred by a participating primary care provider. A carrier may require a
Page 2 - 132LR1901(03)
direct primary health care provider making a referral who is not a member of the carrier's
provider network to provide information demonstrating that the provider is a direct primary
health care provider through a written attestation or copy of a direct primary health care
service agreement with an enrollee and may request additional information necessary to
implement this subsection. As used in this subsection, "direct primary health care provider"
has the same meaning as in Title 22, section 1771, subsection 1, paragraph B.
