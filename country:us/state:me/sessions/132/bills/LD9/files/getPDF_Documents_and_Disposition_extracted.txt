25 be stated.
26 2. Not authorized by candidate. If the a public communication described in

11 must include the statement in written text. A public communication that does not contain
12 a visual aspect must include an audible statement. This statement is required only for public
13 communications made through broadcast or cable television, broadcast radio, Internet
14 audio and video programming, direct mail or newspaper or other periodical publications.
15 A cable television, broadcast television or Internet video communication must include both
16 an audible and a written statement. For a cable television, broadcast television or Internet
17 video communication 30 seconds or less in duration, the audible statement may be modified
18 to include only the single top funder.
19 The top funders named in the required statement consist of the funders providing the
20 highest dollar amount of funding to the entity making the independent expenditure since
21 the day following the most recent general election day.
22 A. For purposes of this subsection, "funder" includes:
23 (1) Any entity that has made a contribution as defined in section 1052, subsection
24 3 to the entity making the independent expenditure since the day following the
25 most recent general election day; and

30 election day.
31 B. If funders have given equal amounts, creating a tie in the ranking of the top 3
32 funders, the tie must be broken by naming the tying funders in chronological order of
33 the receipt of funding until 3 funders are included in the statement. If the chronological
34 order cannot be discerned, the entity making the independent expenditure may choose

42 as appropriate. If there are no funders required to be included under this subsection,
43 no statement is required.
Page 3 - 132LR0294(01)
1 E. When compiling the list of top funders, an entity making an independent
2 expenditure may disregard any funds that the entity can show were used for purposes

7 or a print communication of 20 square inches or less, the requirements of this
8 subsection are satisfied by including the name of the single highest funder only.
9 G. If the list of funders changes during the period in which a recurring public
10 communication is aired or published, the statement appearing in the public
11 communication must be updated at the time that any additional payments are made for
12 that public communication.
13 H. The commission may establish by routine technical rule, adopted in accordance
14 with Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A, forms and procedures for ensuring
15 compliance with this subsection. Rules adopted pursuant to this paragraph must ensure
16 that the information required by this subsection is effectively conveyed for a sufficient
17 duration and in a sufficient font size or screen size where when applicable without
18 undue burden on the ability of the entity to make the public communication. The rules
19 must also provide an exemption for types of public communications for which the
20 required statement would be impossible or impose an unusual hardship due to the
21 unique format or medium of the public communication.
22 3. Broadcasting prohibited without disclosure. No A person operating a
23 broadcasting station or cable television system within this State may not broadcast any
24 public communication, as described in subsections 1 to 2‑A, without an oral or written

30 a ballot question. Any in-kind contributions of printed materials used or distributed by a
31 candidate, political committee or political action committee must include the name or title
32 of that candidate, political committee or political action committee as the authorizing agent
33 for the printing and distribution of the in-kind contribution.
34 3-B. Newspapers. A newspaper may not publish a public communication described

36 purposes of this subsection, "newspaper" includes any printed material intended for general
37 circulation or to be read by the general public, including a version of the newspaper
38 displayed on a website owned or operated by the newspaper. When necessary, a newspaper

40 requires the disclosure.
41 4. Enforcement. A violation of this section may result in a civil penalty of no more
42 than 100% of the amount of the expenditure in violation, except that an expenditure for
43 yard signs lacking the required information may result in a maximum civil penalty of $200.
44 In assessing a civil penalty, the commission shall consider, among other things, how widely
45 the public communication was disseminated, whether the violation was intentional,
Page 4 - 132LR0294(01)
416 whether the violation occurred as the result of an error by a printer or other paid vendor
427 and whether the public communication conceals or misrepresents the identity of the person
438 who financed it. If the person who financed the public communication or who committed
449 the violation corrects the violation within 10 days after receiving notification of the
550 violation from the commission by adding the missing information to the public

33 officer or treasurer requesting a determination may either appear in person or designate a
34 representative to appear on the principal officer's or treasurer's behalf or submit a sworn
35 statement explaining the mitigating circumstances for consideration by the commission. A
36 final determination by the commission may be appealed to the Superior Court in

459 regular mail and e-mail. If the committee or other person has not filed the report after these
560 2 notices, commission staff may refer the violation to the commission, which may, after
571 providing notice and an opportunity to be heard, determine whether a violation has occurred
582 and, if so, the amount of any penalty. The maximum penalty for failure to file a report
593 required under section 1059 is $10,000 or the amount of financial activity not reported,
1504 whichever is greater. A person who fails to file a report as required by this subchapter after
1515 the commission has sent the first 2 notices required in this subsection is guilty of a Class E
1526 crime, except that, if a penalty is assessed pursuant to this subsection and collected by the

24 question committees to cover the financial activity in the committee's campaign account
25 generally, not just the committee's deposits.
26 11. It clarifies that state campaign finance law applies to the financial activities of
27 candidates, party committees, political action committees and others to influence elections
28 for municipal office in towns and cities with a population of 15,000 or more.

23 other than the candidate or the candidate's authorized committee is broadcast by radio, only
24 the city and state of the address of the person who financed the public communication must
25 be stated.
26 2. Not authorized by candidate. If the a public communication described in

39 that is disseminated during the 28 days, including election day, before a primary election,

Page 2 - 132LR0294(01)

416 of the person that financed the public communication. The disclosure is not required if the
427 public communication was not made for the purpose of influencing the candidate's
438 nomination for election or election.
4 2-B. Top 3 funders; independent expenditures. A public communication that is
5 funded by an entity making an independent expenditure as defined in section 1019‑B,
6 subsection 1 must conspicuously include the following statement:

8 of top 3 funders)."

11 must include the statement in written text. A public communication that does not contain
12 a visual aspect must include an audible statement. This statement is required only for public
13 communications made through broadcast or cable television, broadcast radio, Internet
14 audio and video programming, direct mail or newspaper or other periodical publications.
15 A cable television, broadcast television or Internet video communication must include both
16 an audible and a written statement. For a cable television, broadcast television or Internet
17 video communication 30 seconds or less in duration, the audible statement may be modified
18 to include only the single top funder.
19 The top funders named in the required statement consist of the funders providing the
20 highest dollar amount of funding to the entity making the independent expenditure since
21 the day following the most recent general election day.
22 A. For purposes of this subsection, "funder" includes:
23 (1) Any entity that has made a contribution as defined in section 1052, subsection
24 3 to the entity making the independent expenditure since the day following the
25 most recent general election day; and
26 (2) Any entity that has given a gift, subscription, loan, advance or deposit of money
27 or anything of value, including a promise or agreement to provide money or
28 anything of value whether or not legally enforceable, except for transactions in
29 which a fair value is given in return, since the day following the most recent general
30 election day.
31 B. If funders have given equal amounts, creating a tie in the ranking of the top 3
32 funders, the tie must be broken by naming the tying funders in chronological order of
33 the receipt of funding until 3 funders are included in the statement. If the chronological
34 order cannot be discerned, the entity making the independent expenditure may choose
35 which of the tying funders to include in the statement. In no case may a A public
36 communication may not be required to include the names of more than 3 funders.
37 C. The statement required under this subsection is not required to include the name of
38 any funder who has provided less than $1,000 to the entity making the independent
39 expenditure since the day following the most recent general election day.

41 communication must identify the number of funders as "top funder" or "top 2 funders"
42 as appropriate. If there are no funders required to be included under this subsection,
43 no statement is required.
Page 3 - 132LR0294(01)

1 E. When compiling the list of top funders, an entity making an independent
2 expenditure may disregard any funds that the entity can show were used for purposes
3 unrelated to the candidate mentioned in the public communication on the basis that
4 funds were either spent in the order received or were strictly segregated in other
5 accounts.
6 F. In any public communication consisting of an audio broadcast of 30 seconds or less
7 or a print communication of 20 square inches or less, the requirements of this
8 subsection are satisfied by including the name of the single highest funder only.
9 G. If the list of funders changes during the period in which a recurring public
10 communication is aired or published, the statement appearing in the public
11 communication must be updated at the time that any additional payments are made for
12 that public communication.
13 H. The commission may establish by routine technical rule, adopted in accordance
14 with Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A, forms and procedures for ensuring
15 compliance with this subsection. Rules adopted pursuant to this paragraph must ensure
16 that the information required by this subsection is effectively conveyed for a sufficient
17 duration and in a sufficient font size or screen size where when applicable without
