JOINT RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING MAY 2025 AS JEWISH
AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH
WHEREAS, May is Jewish American Heritage Month, established by the United States
Congress to recognize the more than 365-year history of Jewish contributions to American
culture; and
WHEREAS, Jewish Americans, in the face of unspeakable discrimination and adversity,
have fought tirelessly to realize the promise of the nationâ€™s founding and their achievements
have enriched the country, stirred our conscience and challenged us to extend the miracles of
freedom and security; and
WHEREAS, Jewish Americans have worked to strengthen the promise of religious
freedom because their ancestors were tested from the moment they came together and professed
their faith, and Jewish Americans continue to teach us empathy and compassion, inspired by
their parents and grandparents, who know how it felt to be a stranger, and to stand up for a
more perfect union for all; and
WHEREAS, Jewish communities continue to confront hostility and bigotry, including in
America; and
WHEREAS, our nation shares an obligation to condemn and combat anti-Semitism and
hatred wherever it exists and we remain committed to standing against the ugly tide of anti-
Semitism in all its forms, including the denial or trivialization of the Holocaust; and
WHEREAS, during Jewish American Heritage Month, we celebrate the hard-fought
progress won through struggle and sacrifice and we rededicate ourselves to building a world
where diversity is cherished and faith is protected; now, therefore, be it
RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Thirty-second Legislature
now assembled in the First Special Session, on behalf of the people we represent, recognize
May 2025 as Jewish American Heritage Month and take this opportunity to urge the citizens
of the State to observe Jewish American Heritage Month with appropriate programs,
ceremonies and activities.
