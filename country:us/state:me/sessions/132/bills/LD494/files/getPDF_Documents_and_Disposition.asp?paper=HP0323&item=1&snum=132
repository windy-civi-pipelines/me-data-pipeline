14 amended to read:
15 1. Class A restaurant or restaurant and off-premises retail licensee on same

19 remaining portion of the premises, as long as necessary qualifications are maintained for
20 each separately licensed area and food is available for free or purchase at all times that
21 liquor is sold for on-premises consumption.
22 Sec. A-4. 28-A MRSA §10, sub-§2-B, as amended by PL 2021, c. 658, §§45 and

26 A. There may be access between the 2 licensed areas when there is a clear delineation
27 of space, by a wall or permanent barrier that separates the 2 licensed areas and allows
28 only one clearly defined and controlled point of access for patrons between the licensed
29 establishments. The controlled point of access is not required to include a door that
30 must be physically opened and closed.

1 SUMMARY
22 This bill makes multiple changes to the laws governing certain requirements and
33 license provisions administered by the Department of Administrative and Financial
44 Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations.
5 Part A of the bill amends areas of statute concerning license types in the following
6 ways.
7 1. It creates a new license type for agency liquor stores that are purveyors of spirits.
8 2. It amends the definition of "vessel" by reducing the minimum number of passengers
9 a ship must have to be considered a vessel for liquor licensing purposes.
10 3. It adds licensed restaurants to the entities eligible for an off-premises catering
11 license.
12 4. It removes the requirement that premises holding both an on-premises restaurant or
13 Class A restaurant license and an off-premises retail license must sell food with the
14 purchase of an alcoholic beverage. Instead, the bill requires that food be available for free
15 or purchase at all times that liquor is sold for on-premises consumption.
16 5. It authorizes licensees licensed to sell malt liquor for on-premises or off-premises
17 consumption to also sell low-alcohol spirits products. It also authorizes a licensed in-state
18 wholesaler of malt liquor to sell and distribute low-alcohol spirits products.
19 6. It authorizes reselling agents to sell fortified wine to retail licensees for on-premises
20 consumption.
21 7. It creates statutory consistency within license types for auditoriums, civic
22 auditoriums, outdoor stadiums and performing arts centers.
23 8. It provides that, in order to receive a liquor license, a hotel must have a minimum
24 of 4 guest rooms and be licensed by the Department of Health and Human Services. It
25 authorizes licensed hotels to permit consumers to transport liquor to individual guest
26 rooms.
27 9. It authorizes the bureau to allow a wholesale licensee to rent or lease an area or
28 room from any unlicensed venue for the purpose of inviting retail licensees to taste test
29 wine or malt liquor products.
30 Part B of the bill amends the bureau's annual reporting requirements to provide
31 statements regarding lottery operations and liquor licensing operations for the preceding
32 fiscal year rather than the calendar year.
33 Part C of the bill prohibits a licensee or applicant for a license from receiving, directly
34 or indirectly, anything of monetary value greater than $750 from a person engaged directly
35 or indirectly in the various facets of manufacturing, distributing, selling, storing and
36 transporting liquor. It specifies that the bona fide sale of goods by a manufacturer,
37 distributor or out-of-state wholesaler does not violate that prohibition if the price of that
38 sale is of fair market value. It also prohibits a licensee from giving a thing of value with
39 the intent to induce a retailer to purchase alcohol from the licensee to the exclusion of
40 alcohol offered for sale by other persons.
41 Part D of the bill repeals the section of law governing signage restrictions for liquor
42 licensees.
