An Act to Update and Clarify Certain Provisions of State Liquor and Lottery
Laws
Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, certain provisions in this legislation relate to businesses that cater to
tourists, and the Legislature recognizes that the tourism season is crucial for the State's
economy and public well-being; and
Whereas, the tourism season, which brings millions of visitors and significant
revenue to the State, relies on a regulated and enjoyable environment, including accessible
and responsible alcohol sales; and
Whereas, for these reasons, this legislation needs to take effect before the expiration
of the 90-day period; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore,
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:

Commission or the United States Coast Guard.

amended to read:
1. Class A restaurant or restaurant and off-premises retail licensee on same
premises not prohibited. If a portion of the premises is licensed as an off-premises retail
licensee, no provision within this Title may not be construed to prohibit issuance of a Class
III or Class IV license to the same licensee for a restaurant or Class A restaurant for the
remaining portion of the premises, as long as necessary qualifications are maintained for
each separately licensed area and food is available for free or purchase at all times that
liquor is sold for on-premises consumption.
Sec. A-4. 28-A MRSA §10, sub-§2-B, as amended by PL 2021, c. 658, §§45 and
46, is further amended to read:
2-B. Access exception. Notwithstanding subsection 2, there may be access between
the 2 licensed areas by the public as provided by this subsection.
A. There may be access between the 2 licensed areas when there is a clear delineation
of space, by a wall or permanent barrier that separates the 2 licensed areas and allows
only one clearly defined and controlled point of access for patrons between the licensed
establishments. The controlled point of access is not required to include a door that
must be physically opened and closed.
B. When access between the 2 licensed areas exists for patrons of either establishment,
all food must be available for free or purchase at all times that malt liquor and wine is
sold for on-premises consumption must be served by an employee of the licensed on-
premises establishment and:.
(1) Must be accompanied by a full meal prepared in a separate and complete
kitchen on the premises of the on-premises establishment if the on-premises
establishment is a Class A restaurant; or
(2) Must be accompanied by a full meal or a hot or cold meal prepared in a separate

restaurant menu, including, but not limited to, sandwiches, salads, hamburgers,
cheeseburgers, hot dogs and pizza. A meal consisting solely of prepackaged snack
foods such as popcorn, chips or pretzels is not a "hot or cold meal" within the
meaning of this subparagraph.
C. Malt liquor or wine sold or served on the premises may not be transported by a
patron or employee of either establishment from one licensed area to another. The
licensee shall ensure that easily readable signs are conspicuously posted to inform the
