COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to S.P. 738, L.D. 1868
1 SUMMARY
22 This amendment does the following.
3 1. It removes the sections of the bill directing the Governor’s Energy Office to conduct
4 procurements of renewable and clean resources and authorizing the office to adopt rules. It
5 also removes the section of the bill requiring investor-owned transmission and distribution
6 utilities to be subject to a special assessment for expenditures of the office.
7 2. It changes the proposed definition of "Class III resource" to include that this resource
8 type includes sources of generation relying on nuclear power plants and hydroelectric
9 generators that meet all state and federal fish passage requirements applicable to the
10 generators. It establishes criteria that allow other sources of electrical generation to qualify
11 as Class III resources.
12 3. It clarifies that the Public Utilities Commission may coordinate with one or more
13 states to procure transmission capacity, capacity resources, renewable energy credits or
14 clean energy credits if it determines that the likely benefits to ratepayers in the State will
15 exceed the likely costs.
16 4. It removes the section of the bill that requires the commission to conduct a
17 competitive solicitation for energy or renewable energy credits from eligible Class IA
18 resources as defined in the bill.
19 5. It makes technical changes to the bill for consistency.
