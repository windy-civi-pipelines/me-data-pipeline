pursuant to subsection 8 or the alternative compliance payment mechanism
pursuant to subsection 9, or both of these methods, has burdened electricity
customers in the State without providing the benefits of new Class III resources,
the commission may suspend all or some of the future scheduled increases in the
portfolio requirements under paragraph A.
(2) If the commission finds that more than 10% of the obligations required to
satisfy the portfolio requirements for Class III resources under paragraph A are met
through alternative compliance payments made pursuant to subsection 9 in 3
consecutive calendar years, the commission shall temporarily suspend all or some
of the future scheduled increases in the portfolio requirements under paragraph A.

requirements under paragraph A pursuant to subparagraph (1) or (2), the
commission shall report its rationale for suspension to the joint standing committee
of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy and utilities matters, the
Governor's Energy Office and the Office of the Public Advocate and make
recommendations for modifications to the schedule of increases. The commission
may resume increases, limited to no more than one percentage point per year over
the previous year, in the portfolio requirements after a minimum of one year unless
otherwise directed by the Legislature.

portfolio requirements under paragraph A, documentation of the loss of any existing
clean generation capacity in the State, the status of implementation of the portfolio
requirements under paragraph A, including any suspensions pursuant to paragraph B,

renewable and clean resources and of the opportunities available in this State to purchase
electricity that is generated using those resources, including, but not limited to, the green
power offer and other green power supply products and renewable energy credit and clean
energy credit products certified under section 3212‑A 3212-B. The commission may not
promote any renewable or clean resources over others. The commission may apply for,
receive and expend grant money from the United States Department of Energy and other
government agencies for this purpose. The commission may create or cause to be created
a brand or logo to identify Maine renewable and clean resources, including the green power
offer and other green power supply products and renewable energy credit and clean energy
credit products certified under section 3212‑A 3212-B, to consumers. The commission
shall register any mark or logo created pursuant to this subsection with the United States

under subsection 3-D through an alternative compliance payment mechanism in
accordance with this subsection.
A. The commission shall set the alternative compliance payment rates by rule and shall
publish the alternative compliance payment rates by January 31st of each year. In
setting the rates, the commission shall take into account prevailing market prices,
standard-offer service prices for electricity, alignment with other New England states,
reliance on alternative compliance payments to meet the requirements of subsections
3, 3‑A, 3‑B and, 3‑C and 3-D and investment in Class I, Class IA and, Class II and

3 may not be greater than $10.
B. The commission shall collect alternative compliance payments to meet the
requirements of subsections 3, 3‑A and, 3‑B and 3-D made by competitive electricity
providers and shall use all funds collected under this paragraph to provide financial
assistance for low-income households in accordance with section 3214, subsection 2.
C. The commission shall collect alternative compliance payments to meet the
requirements of subsection 3‑C made by competitive electricity providers and shall

(1) If by March 31, 2031 and every 2 years thereafter the commission determines
that investment in Class III resources in the preceding 2 calendar years has not
been sufficient for competitive electricity providers to meet the portfolio
requirements under paragraph A and that the resulting use of clean energy credits
pursuant to subsection 8 or the alternative compliance payment mechanism
pursuant to subsection 9, or both of these methods, has burdened electricity
customers in the State without providing the benefits of new Class III resources,
the commission may suspend all or some of the future scheduled increases in the
portfolio requirements under paragraph A.
(2) If the commission finds that more than 10% of the obligations required to
satisfy the portfolio requirements for Class III resources under paragraph A are met
through alternative compliance payments made pursuant to subsection 9 in 3
consecutive calendar years, the commission shall temporarily suspend all or some
of the future scheduled increases in the portfolio requirements under paragraph A.
(3) If the commission suspends any scheduled increases in the portfolio
requirements under paragraph A pursuant to subparagraph (1) or (2), the
commission shall report its rationale for suspension to the joint standing committee
of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy and utilities matters, the
Governor's Energy Office and the Office of the Public Advocate and make
recommendations for modifications to the schedule of increases. The commission
may resume increases, limited to no more than one percentage point per year over
the previous year, in the portfolio requirements after a minimum of one year unless
otherwise directed by the Legislature.
C. No later than March 31, 2027 and annually thereafter, the commission shall submit
a report regarding the status of Class III resources in the State and compliance with the
