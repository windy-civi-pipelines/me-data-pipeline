1155 environmental attributes or a combination of both from renewable and clean resources
1166 through long-term contracts if the office determines procurement is necessary to achieve
1177 the emissions reduction and renewable and clean energy goals of the State and to meet
1188 reasonably expected growth in electricity demand and reliability needs. This bill amends
1199 the state goals for consumption of electricity from renewable resources so that by January
2200 1, 2040, 90% of retail sales electricity in the State will come from renewable resources and
2211 10% of retail sales electricity in the State will come from clean resources. This bill gives
2222 additional authority to the Public Utilities Commission to coordinate with other states to
2233 procure, through long-term contracts or other mechanisms, transmission capacity, capacity
2244 resources, energy, renewable energy credits or clean energy credits. This bill directs the
2255 Public Utilities Commission to initiate a competitive solicitation for energy or renewable
