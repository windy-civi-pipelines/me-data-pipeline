1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:

3 amended to read:
4 Highways, town ways and streets legally established shall must be opened and kept in
5 repair so as to be safe and convenient for travelers with motor vehicles in accordance with
6 standards established by the Department of Transportation, which must include standards
7 for a petition process if a town liable to maintain a highway, town way or street
8 unreasonably neglects to keep it in repair. In default thereof, those liable may be indicted,
9 convicted and a reasonable fine imposed therefor. In determining whether a highway, town
10 way or street is kept in repair so as to be safe and convenient, differences in roadway surface
11 and the season of the year must be taken into consideration.
12 Sec. 2. 23 MRSA §3652 is repealed.

15 SUMMARY
1166 This bill amends the provision of law that requires highways, town ways and streets
1177 legally established be opened and kept in repair so as to be safe and convenient for travelers
1188 with motor vehicles to require that this be done in accordance with standards established
1199 by the Department of Transportation. It provides that in determining whether highways,
2200 town ways and streets are kept in repair so as to be safe and convenient, differences in
2211 roadway surface and the season of the year must be taken into consideration. It repeals the
2222 provision of law that provides for a petition process involving the county commissioners
2233 when a town liable to maintain a way unreasonably neglects to keep it in repair and instead
2244 provides for an updated petition process in accordance with standards established by the
2255 department.
