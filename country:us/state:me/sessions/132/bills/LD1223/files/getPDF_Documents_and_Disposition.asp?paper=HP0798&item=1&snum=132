1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 35-A MRSA §3149 is enacted to read:
3 §3149. Procurement and arrearage management program funding
4 1. Procurement costs to be paid from General Fund. Notwithstanding any
5 provision of this Title to the contrary, if the commission requires a transmission and
6 distribution utility to purchase or otherwise contract for energy, renewable energy credits,
7 energy storage systems or transmission infrastructure pursuant to applicable law, costs
8 incurred by a transmission and distribution utility for the purchase or contract may not be
9 incorporated into rates, and costs associated with the purchase or procurement must be paid
10 from the General Fund. The commission may not require a transmission and distribution
11 utility to purchase or otherwise contract for energy, renewable energy credits, energy
12 storage systems or transmission infrastructure unless the commission has submitted
13 legislation to request funding to be paid into the Energy Procurement and Arrearage
14 Management Program Cost Fund established in subsection 2 and adequate funding is
15 available within the fund.
16 2. Energy Procurement and Arrearage Management Program Cost Fund. The
17 Energy Procurement and Arrearage Management Program Cost Fund is established within
18 the commission as a nonlapsing fund for the purposes of paying costs incurred by a
19 transmission and distribution utility to purchase or otherwise contract for energy,
20 renewable energy credits, energy storage systems or transmission infrastructure pursuant
21 to applicable law as described in subsection 1 and costs incurred by a transmission and
22 distribution utility associated with an arrearage management program pursuant to section

28 through the volumetric charge on the customer's electricity bill that are not received
29 by a transmission and distribution utility due to application of kilowatt-hour credits
30 to the customer's electricity bill; and
31 (2) Costs incurred by a transmission and distribution utility for the administration
32 of net energy billing arrangements.
33 Sec. 3. 35-A MRSA §3209-A, sub-§10 is enacted to read:

35 program costs may not be included or incorporated in the operating expenses of a
36 transmission and distribution utility to be recovered in rates and must be paid from the
37 General Fund. The commission shall submit legislation to request funding to be paid into
38 the Net Energy Billing Cost Stabilization Fund established in section 3209-B, subsection
39 10 to ensure that adequate funding is available to pay kilowatt-hour credit program costs.
40 The commission shall adopt rules to establish a process by which kilowatt-hour credit
41 program costs are distributed to transmission and distribution utilities using funds from the
42 Net Energy Billing Cost Stabilization Fund. The rules must require a transmission and
43 distribution utility to provide to the commission, at least biennially, an estimate of kilowatt-
Page 1 - 132LR1905(01)

414 hour credit program costs for the following year. The commission rules must establish a
425 schedule for the commission's payment of kilowatt-hour program costs and a reconciliation
436 process by which any overpayments are returned by a transmission and distribution utility
447 to the Net Energy Billing Cost Stabilization Fund. Notwithstanding any provision of this

1 Sec. 11. 35-A MRSA §3214, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2023, c. 201, §1; c. 230,
2 §2; c. 306, §§2 and 3; and c. 361, §§3 to 5, is further amended to read:
3 2. Low-income assistance. In order to continue existing levels of financial assistance

14 households. To the extent possible, assistance must be provided in a manner most
15 likely to prevent the loss of other federal assistance; and
16 C. Receive funds remitted by transmission and distribution utilities with net energy
17 billing arrangements for expired kilowatt‑hour credits in accordance with section
18 3209‑A, subsection 8.
19 The commission may use funds available under this subsection to provide financial

21 commission in a proceeding or by rule. Except as provided in paragraphs A-1 and C, the
22 commission may not provide financial assistance to low-income households pursuant to

30 distribution utility shall implement pursuant to this subsection an arrearage management
31 program to assist eligible low-income residential customers who are in arrears on their
32 electricity bills. An arrearage management program implemented pursuant to this
33 subsection is a plan under which a transmission and distribution utility works with an
34 eligible low-income residential customer to establish an affordable payment plan and
35 provide credit to that customer toward the customer's accumulated arrears as long as that
36 customer remains in compliance with the terms of the program. If a consumer-owned
37 transmission and distribution utility elects to implement an arrearage management
38 program, it must do so in accordance with this subsection and rules adopted pursuant to
39 this subsection. All reasonable costs incurred by a transmission and distribution utility,
40 including, but not limited to, incremental costs, reconnection fees, administrative costs,
41 marketing costs, costs for any 3rd-party assistance received by the transmission and
42 distribution utility in administering its arrearage management program and costs for
43 providing financial and budgetary guidance to participants whether provided directly or
Page 4 - 132LR1905(01)

414 through a 3rd party contracted by the transmission and distribution utility to provide that
425 guidance, must be paid from the Energy Procurement and Arrearage Management Program
436 Cost Fund established in section 3149, subsection 2. The commission shall submit
447 legislation to request funding to be paid into the Energy Procurement and Arrearage
458 Management Program Cost Fund to ensure that adequate funding is available to pay
469 reasonable costs incurred by a transmission and distribution utility in administering its
570 arrearage management program. The amount of any arrearage forgiven that is treated as
581 bad debt for purposes of cost recovery by the transmission and distribution utility may not
592 be included as a reasonable cost. The commission shall establish requirements relating to
1503 the arrearage management programs by rule. Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are
1514 routine technical rules pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.
12 In adopting rules regarding arrearage management programs, the commission shall:
13 A. Consider best practices as developed and implemented in other states or regions;
14 B. Require that an arrearage management program include an electricity usage
15 assessment at no cost to the participant;
16 D. Ensure that a transmission and distribution utility develops terms and conditions
17 for its arrearage management program in a manner that is consistent with the program's
18 objectives and is in the best interests of all ratepayers; and
19 D-1. Ensure that if a transmission and distribution utility produces any materials, either
20 written or electronic, regarding the arrearage management program offered by the
21 utility, those materials must state in plainly worded language and in a type size that is
22 no less than 12 points that state law requires the utility to offer an arrearage
23 management program to its customers and that costs described in paragraph E are not
24 paid for by the utility; and.
25 E. Ensure that a transmission and distribution utility recovers in rates all reasonable
26 costs of arrearage management programs, including:
27 (1) Incremental costs;
28 (2) Reconnection fees;
29 (3) Administrative costs;
30 (4) Marketing costs;
31 (5) Costs for any 3rd-party assistance it receives in administering its arrearage
32 management program; and
33 (6) Costs for providing financial and budgetary guidance to participants whether
34 provided directly or through a 3rd party contracted by the transmission and
35 distribution utility to provide that guidance.
36 The amount of any arrearage forgiven that is treated as bad debt for purposes of cost
37 recovery by the transmission and distribution utility may not be included as a
38 reasonable cost under this paragraph.
39 The Efficiency Maine Trust shall work with investor-owned transmission and distribution
40 utilities, consumer-owned transmission and distribution utilities that elect to participate in
41 an arrearage management program and other stakeholders to provide access to a
Page 5 - 132LR1905(01)

412 complementary low-income energy efficiency program for participants in arrearage
423 management programs in order to help reduce participants' energy consumption.
3 No later than January 28, 2028, the commission shall prepare a report assessing the
4 effectiveness of arrearage management programs from October 1, 2024 through September
5 30, 2027, including the number of participants enrolled in the programs, the number of
6 participants completing the programs, the number of participants who have failed to
7 complete the programs, the dollar amount of arrears forgiven, the impact on any
8 participating transmission and distribution utility's bad debt as a result of the programs, the
9 costs and benefits to all ratepayers associated with the programs and recommendations for
10 ways in which the programs might be improved or continued for the benefit of all
11 ratepayers. In preparing its report, the commission shall hold at least one formal
12 stakeholder meeting involving affected parties, including the Office of the Public Advocate
13 and the participating transmission and distribution utilities. Parties must also be provided
14 an opportunity to submit written comments to the commission regarding the performance
15 of the programs.
16 The joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over utilities matters
17 may report out a bill relating to the commission report to the Second Regular Session of
18 the 133rd Legislature.
19 This subsection is repealed September 30, 2028.
20 Sec. 13. 36 MRSA §656, sub-§1, ¶L, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 682, §5, is
21 amended to read:

30 distribution utility and a utility customer or customers receive a utility bill credit
31 for the energy generated by the equipment pursuant to Title 35‑A, section 3209‑A
32 or 3209‑B and the generator of electricity entered into a fully executed
33 interconnection agreement with a transmission and distribution utility prior to June
34 1, 2024.
35 On or before April 1st of the first property tax year for which a taxpayer claims an
36 exemption under this paragraph, the taxpayer claiming the exemption shall file a report

10 SUMMARY
1111 This bill does the following.
12 1. It prohibits the recovery in rates of costs incurred by a transmission and distribution
13 utility that are attributable to net energy billing and provides that such costs must be paid
14 from the General Fund. The bill directs the Public Utilities Commission to adopt routine
15 technical rules to identify the types of costs that are attributable to net energy billing.
16 2. It provides that costs incurred by a transmission and distribution utility for the
17 purchase or contracting required by the commission for energy, renewable energy credits,
18 energy storage systems and transmission infrastructure must be paid from the General
19 Fund.
20 3. It prohibits an electricity customer in the State who is a participant in an assistance
21 program from purchasing generation service from a competitive electricity provider and
22 requires that the customer be enrolled in standard-offer service.
23 4. It requires the commission to require a standard-offer service provider to implement
24 time-of-use rates for residential and small commercial customers in the service area of a
25 transmission and distribution utility if the utility has the necessary electric billing and
26 metering services to accommodate time-of-use rates. It also requires the commission to
27 require a transmission and distribution utility that has selected one or more standard-offer
28 service providers to establish electric billing and metering services necessary to
29 accommodate time-of-use rates.
30 5. It provides that certain costs associated with low-income assistance provided by the
31 commission and an arrearage management program established by a transmission and
32 distribution utility may not be paid by an assessment on the utilities or by electricity
33 customers and instead must be paid from the General Fund.
34 6. It excepts electricity consumed by residential and small commercial customers from
35 the definition of "tangible personal property" that is subject to sales tax.
36 7. It limits the applicability of a property tax exemption for solar energy equipment to
37 those that have been approved by the municipality in which the solar energy equipment is
38 located.
