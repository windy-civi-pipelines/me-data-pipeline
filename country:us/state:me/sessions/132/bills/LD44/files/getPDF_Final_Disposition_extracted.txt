fishery annual landings do not exceed the overall annual quota established by the Atlantic
States Marine Fisheries Commission. Prior to allocating any portion of the overall annual
quota for the State established pursuant to paragraph A, the commissioner may withhold

person issued a license under this section or section 6302‑A, subsection 3, paragraph E,
E‑1, F or G may not take, possess or sell elvers in excess of the weight quota allocated to

A. Establish an overall annual quota for the State;
B. Establish the amount of the overall annual quota under paragraph A that is allocated
to persons licensed under this section and specify a formula to establish individual
quotas for persons licensed under this section. The formula may take into account the
amount of elvers a person licensed under this section lawfully harvested in previous
seasons based on final harvesting reports. The rules must specify the date by which
harvester reports are considered final for the purpose of determining individual quotas;
and
C. Provide, in accordance with section 6302‑B, that 21.9% of the overall annual quota
under paragraph A is allocated to the federally recognized Indian tribes in the State and
establish the amount of that portion of the overall annual quota allocated to the
Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians
and the Mi'kmaq Nation.
If persons issued licenses under this section collectively exceed the overall annual quota
allocated to those persons pursuant to paragraph B, the number of pounds by which the
license holders exceeded that overall annual quota must be deducted from the following
year’s overall annual quota allocated to persons licensed under this section. If the overage
exceeds the overall annual quota allocated to persons licensed under this section for the
following year, the overage must be deducted from the overall annual quota allocated to
persons licensed under this section in subsequent years until the entire overage has been
accounted for.
The commissioner may adopt or amend rules on an emergency basis if immediate action is
necessary to establish and implement the elver individual fishing quota in advance of the
beginning of the elver fishing season.
Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5,
chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.

Section 2:

Prior to the issuance of an elver fishing license, the commissioner may require an
applicant to complete an educational course that the commissioner determines appropriate
to provide necessary information regarding the proper handling of elvers to ensure
survivability.
