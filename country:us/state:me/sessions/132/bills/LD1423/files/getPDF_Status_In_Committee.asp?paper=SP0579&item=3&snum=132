27 SUMMARY
2288 This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, replaces the bill. It
2299 amends the law establishing a stewardship program for packaging material as follows.
30 1. It amends the definitions under that law for "packaging material," "post-consumer
31 recycled material," "producer" and "toxicity" and introduces a new definition for
32 "consumer." The definition of "packaging material" is amended to exclude packaging
33 material associated with certain federally regulated products, including drugs, medical
34 devices and biological products for human and veterinary use.
35 2. It clarifies the producer exemption provisions under that law regarding packaging
36 material for perishable food to provide that a producer is exempt from the requirements and
37 prohibitions of the law with respect to the first 15 tons of packaging material used by the
38 producer to contain, protect, deliver, present or distribute products that were perishable
39 food and that were sold, offered for sale or distributed for sale in or into the State during
40 the prior calendar year.
41 3. It amends the requirements for the statewide recycling needs assessment to be
42 conducted by the entity selected by the Department of Environmental Protection to serve
Page 6 - 132LR0987(03)

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to S.P. 579, L.D. 1423
413 as the stewardship organization for the packaging stewardship program to include an
424 evaluation of the producer payments schedule adopted by the department by rule and the
435 anticipated effect of that schedule on incentivizing the use by producers of readily
446 recyclable packaging materials and supporting the State's solid waste management
457 hierarchy.
6 It also provides that, following the execution of a contract between the selected stewardship
7 organization and the department, the stewardship organization, based on the statewide
8 recycling needs assessment and other available information, may recommend to the
9 department that the adopted producer payments schedule be modified to better incentivize
10 the use by producers of readily recyclable packaging materials and support the State's solid
11 waste management hierarchy and the department may, in its discretion, initiate rulemaking
12 to implement any modifications to that schedule.
13 4. It clarifies the law regarding the requirements for producers or the stewardship
14 organization to provide or for the department to publish information regarding the UPCs
15 for products for which the producers are in compliance with or not in compliance with the
16 law.
17 5. It provides that a producer may not be required to pay an increased fee or penalty
18 under the law for packaging material that is not composed of post-consumer recycled
19 material if the packaging material is subject to state or federal laws, rules or regulations
20 that effectively prohibit the use of post-consumer recycled material in that packaging
21 material.
22 6. It amends the requirements for municipalities to participate in the packaging
23 stewardship program by clarifying that a participating municipality must provide for the
24 collection and recycling of any packaging material that is generated in the municipality and
25 is readily recyclable.
