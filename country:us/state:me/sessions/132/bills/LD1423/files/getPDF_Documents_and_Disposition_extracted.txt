28 payments required submitted by the stewardship organization for approval under
29 subsection 6, which must include, but is not limited to, provisions regarding the
30 timing of producer payments and the timing of and information required to be
31 provided in the annual producer report required by subsection 7.
32 (a) The payment schedule adopted system approved under this subparagraph
33 must provide for a flat fee option to be assessed on a tiered basis such that a
34 low-volume producer is required to pay no more than $500 per ton of
35 packaging material and no more than $7,500 in total annual fees to the
36 stewardship organization under this section.
37 (b) For producers other than low-volume producers, the payment schedule
38 adopted system approved under this subparagraph must be based on and cover
39 the cost of managing the amount of each type of packaging material sold,
40 offered for sale or distributed for sale in or into the State by a producer and not
41 managed under an approved alternative collection program, adjusted as
42 applicable in accordance with the adjustment criteria adopted pursuant to
43 division (c).
44 (c) For producers other than low-volume producers, the payment schedule
45 adopted system approved under this subparagraph must delineate criteria to be
Page 5 - 132LR0987(01)
416 used to adjust producer payments in a manner that incentivizes the use of
427 recycled content in and increased recyclability of packaging material, lower
438 toxicity in packaging material, a reduction of the amount of packaging material
449 used, a reduction of litter from packaging material, increased reuse of
550 packaging material and labeling of packaging material to reduce consumer
561 confusion including by incentivizing accuracy in recyclability claims
572 displayed on packaging material and that creates other incentives consistent
583 with generally accepted industry standards.
9 (d) The rule payment system approved under this subparagraph must require
10 as part of the annual producer reporting under subsection 7 the provision by a
11 producer of all information necessary for the determination of the producer's
12 payment obligation and the determination of the producer's compliance with
13 respect to its products.
14 (i) For producers other than low-volume producers, the rule payment
15 system must require the producer to provide a description of the methods
16 it used to determine the amount reported for each type of packaging
17 material associated with its products, a description of the characteristics of
18 each type of packaging material that are relevant to the adjustment criteria
19 adopted pursuant to division (c) and a list of the producer's brands and the
20 UPCs of the products associated with each type of packaging material.
21 (ii) For low-volume producers, the rule payment system must require the
22 reporting of only the information necessary for a calculation of the flat fee
23 described in division (a) and a determination of the producer's compliance
24 with the requirements of this section.
25 (iii) The rule payment system must authorize a producer that is unable to
26 fully satisfy the reporting requirements due to a failure to obtain sufficient
27 information regarding the characteristics of the packaging material of
28 products of the producer that are sold, offered for sale or distributed for
29 sale in or into the State to alternatively report to the stewardship
30 organization an estimate of the total amount of that packaging material
31 based on unit quantities as long as such alternative reporting includes a
32 description of the methods used by the producer to calculate the estimate.
33 When a producer alternatively reports an estimate in accordance with this
34 subdivision, unless otherwise determined by the department, the estimate
35 must be adjusted using the least favorable adjustment criteria adopted
36 pursuant to division (c);
37 (2) A process for determining on an annual basis those types of packaging material
38 that are readily recyclable, which must involve consultation with the stewardship
39 organization and recycling establishments and must include a transitional period
40 of no more than one year between the time that a type of packaging material is
41 determined to be readily recyclable or to not be readily recyclable and the time that
42 such determinations will be effective for the purposes of calculating producer
43 payments and municipal reimbursements in accordance with this section;
44 (3) A process for determining on an annual basis which municipalities are similar
45 municipalities, which must involve consultation with participating municipalities;
Page 6 - 132LR0987(01)

5 municipalities. The method for calculating reimbursements must include the
6 median per-ton cost of managing packaging material that is readily recyclable and
7 the median per-ton cost of managing packaging material that is not readily
8 recyclable. The method for calculating reimbursements must involve consultation
9 with participating municipalities and be designed to incentivize municipal waste
10 management activities that represent higher priorities on the solid waste
11 management hierarchy;
12 (5) Requirements for the assessment of stewardship organization to develop a
13 process to assess program performance, including the setting of program goals
14 used to inform the producer payment schedule determined system approved
15 pursuant to subparagraph (1) and the investments in infrastructure and education
16 made pursuant to subsection 11, which must may include, but are not limited to,:
17 program goals supporting an incentive in overall reduction by producers in the
18 amount of packaging material used, an that incentivize an increased reuse by
19 producers of packaging material and that incentivize an increased amount of post-
20 consumer recycled content in packaging material used by producers; packaging
21 material litter reduction goals; recycling access and collection rate goals for
22 municipalities; and overall program and material-specific recycling rate goals.
23 To the maximum extent practicable, the stewardship organization shall propose
24 material-specific recycling rate goals adopted pursuant to this subparagraph must
25 that reflect the following recycling standards:

4 the State for recycling and the tons of each type of packaging material
5 recycled in the State, as well as the ultimate destination of and intended
6 use for that recycled material;
7 (ii) How those audits must be designed so that information collected
8 through the audit of one facility will not be used to infer information about
9 a different facility that uses different processing equipment, different
10 sorting processes or different staffing levels to conduct processing; and
11 (iii) The process by which a facility will be allowed to request and receive
12 an audit if it can credibly demonstrate that an audit result being applied to
13 its material output is not representative of its current operations;

1 SUMMARY
22 This bill amends the laws governing the State's stewardship program for packaging to
33 exclude certain commercial, cosmetic, medical, environmental, dangerous, hazardous or
44 flammable product packaging and packaging of products related to public health and water
55 quality testing from the requirements of the program and updates the definition of "toxicity"
66 for purposes of the program. The bill requires the Department of Environmental Protection
77 to adopt a process to approve a producer payment system under the program. It also updates
88 the definition of "producer" to add clarification regarding packaging of certain products
99 sold at physical retail locations in the State and via the Internet, remote sale or remote
1100 distribution.

24 subchapter 2‑A.
25 A. Rules adopted by the department pursuant to this section must include, at a
26 minimum:
27 (1) A process for annually determining approving a schedule system of producer
28 payments required submitted by the stewardship organization for approval under
29 subsection 6, which must include, but is not limited to, provisions regarding the
30 timing of producer payments and the timing of and information required to be
31 provided in the annual producer report required by subsection 7.
32 (a) The payment schedule adopted system approved under this subparagraph
33 must provide for a flat fee option to be assessed on a tiered basis such that a
34 low-volume producer is required to pay no more than $500 per ton of
35 packaging material and no more than $7,500 in total annual fees to the
36 stewardship organization under this section.
37 (b) For producers other than low-volume producers, the payment schedule
38 adopted system approved under this subparagraph must be based on and cover
39 the cost of managing the amount of each type of packaging material sold,
40 offered for sale or distributed for sale in or into the State by a producer and not
41 managed under an approved alternative collection program, adjusted as
42 applicable in accordance with the adjustment criteria adopted pursuant to
43 division (c).
44 (c) For producers other than low-volume producers, the payment schedule
45 adopted system approved under this subparagraph must delineate criteria to be
Page 5 - 132LR0987(01)

416 used to adjust producer payments in a manner that incentivizes the use of
427 recycled content in and increased recyclability of packaging material, lower
438 toxicity in packaging material, a reduction of the amount of packaging material
449 used, a reduction of litter from packaging material, increased reuse of
550 packaging material and labeling of packaging material to reduce consumer
561 confusion including by incentivizing accuracy in recyclability claims
572 displayed on packaging material and that creates other incentives consistent
583 with generally accepted industry standards.
9 (d) The rule payment system approved under this subparagraph must require
10 as part of the annual producer reporting under subsection 7 the provision by a
11 producer of all information necessary for the determination of the producer's
12 payment obligation and the determination of the producer's compliance with
13 respect to its products.
14 (i) For producers other than low-volume producers, the rule payment
15 system must require the producer to provide a description of the methods
16 it used to determine the amount reported for each type of packaging
17 material associated with its products, a description of the characteristics of
18 each type of packaging material that are relevant to the adjustment criteria
19 adopted pursuant to division (c) and a list of the producer's brands and the
20 UPCs of the products associated with each type of packaging material.
21 (ii) For low-volume producers, the rule payment system must require the
22 reporting of only the information necessary for a calculation of the flat fee
23 described in division (a) and a determination of the producer's compliance
24 with the requirements of this section.
25 (iii) The rule payment system must authorize a producer that is unable to
26 fully satisfy the reporting requirements due to a failure to obtain sufficient
27 information regarding the characteristics of the packaging material of
28 products of the producer that are sold, offered for sale or distributed for
29 sale in or into the State to alternatively report to the stewardship
30 organization an estimate of the total amount of that packaging material
31 based on unit quantities as long as such alternative reporting includes a
32 description of the methods used by the producer to calculate the estimate.
33 When a producer alternatively reports an estimate in accordance with this
34 subdivision, unless otherwise determined by the department, the estimate
35 must be adjusted using the least favorable adjustment criteria adopted
36 pursuant to division (c);
37 (2) A process for determining on an annual basis those types of packaging material
38 that are readily recyclable, which must involve consultation with the stewardship
39 organization and recycling establishments and must include a transitional period
40 of no more than one year between the time that a type of packaging material is
41 determined to be readily recyclable or to not be readily recyclable and the time that
42 such determinations will be effective for the purposes of calculating producer
43 payments and municipal reimbursements in accordance with this section;
44 (3) A process for determining on an annual basis which municipalities are similar
45 municipalities, which must involve consultation with participating municipalities;
Page 6 - 132LR0987(01)

1 (4) A process for determining municipal reimbursements, including a description
2 of the information required from participating municipalities under subsection 9, a
3 method for calculating the reimbursements required under subsection 10 and the
4 timing for participating municipality reporting and payments to participating
5 municipalities. The method for calculating reimbursements must include the
6 median per-ton cost of managing packaging material that is readily recyclable and
7 the median per-ton cost of managing packaging material that is not readily
8 recyclable. The method for calculating reimbursements must involve consultation
9 with participating municipalities and be designed to incentivize municipal waste
10 management activities that represent higher priorities on the solid waste
11 management hierarchy;
12 (5) Requirements for the assessment of stewardship organization to develop a
13 process to assess program performance, including the setting of program goals
14 used to inform the producer payment schedule determined system approved
15 pursuant to subparagraph (1) and the investments in infrastructure and education
16 made pursuant to subsection 11, which must may include, but are not limited to,:
17 program goals supporting an incentive in overall reduction by producers in the
18 amount of packaging material used, an that incentivize an increased reuse by
19 producers of packaging material and that incentivize an increased amount of post-
20 consumer recycled content in packaging material used by producers; packaging
21 material litter reduction goals; recycling access and collection rate goals for
22 municipalities; and overall program and material-specific recycling rate goals.
23 To the maximum extent practicable, the stewardship organization shall propose
24 material-specific recycling rate goals adopted pursuant to this subparagraph must
25 that reflect the following recycling standards:
26 (a) Sorted glass is considered recycled if it does not require further processing
27 before entering a glass furnace or before use in the production of filtration
28 media, abrasive materials, glass fiber insulation or construction materials;
29 (b) Sorted metal is considered recycled if it does not require further processing
30 before entering a smelter or furnace;
31 (c) Sorted paper is considered recycled if it does not require further processing
32 before entering a pulping operation; and
33 (d) Plastic separated by polymer is considered recycled if it does not require
34 further processing before entering a pelletization, extrusion or molding
35 operation or, in the case of plastic flakes, does not require further processing
36 before use in a final product;
37 (6) Requirements for the stewardship organization to conduct representative audits
38 of recyclable material processed and sold by facilities that process recyclable
39 material generated in the State, of municipal solid waste disposed of in the State
40 and of waste littered in the State, which must include, but are not limited to:
41 (a) Provisions regarding the sampling techniques to be used in those audits,
42 which must include random sampling;
43 (b) For audits of recyclable material, provisions regarding:
Page 7 - 132LR0987(01)

1 (i) How those audits must be designed to collect information regarding
2 the extent to which recyclable material processed and sold by those
3 facilities reflects the tons of each type of packaging material collected in
4 the State for recycling and the tons of each type of packaging material
5 recycled in the State, as well as the ultimate destination of and intended
6 use for that recycled material;
7 (ii) How those audits must be designed so that information collected
8 through the audit of one facility will not be used to infer information about
9 a different facility that uses different processing equipment, different
10 sorting processes or different staffing levels to conduct processing; and
11 (iii) The process by which a facility will be allowed to request and receive
12 an audit if it can credibly demonstrate that an audit result being applied to
13 its material output is not representative of its current operations;
14 (c) For audits of municipal solid waste, provisions regarding how the audits
15 will be designed to collect information regarding the types and amount,
16 whether by weight or volume, of packaging material in the waste stream and
17 the percentage by weight and volume of the waste stream that is composed of
18 packaging material; and
19 (d) For audits of waste littered in the State, provisions regarding how the audits
20 will be designed to collect information regarding the packaging material type
21 by amount, whether by weight or volume, in sampled litter, identification of
22 the producer or producers of the packaging material in sampled litter, if
23 identifiable, and an evaluation based on those audits regarding the areas of the
24 State in which litter accumulation is greatest;
25 (7) A schedule by which the stewardship organization must annually report to the
26 department pursuant to subsection 5 and a schedule by which a producer or group
27 of producers operating an approved alternative collection program must annually
28 report to the stewardship organization and to the department pursuant to subsection
29 8, paragraph D; and
30 (8) A process by which the stewardship organization will develop and submit for
31 department review and a process by which the department shall review and approve
32 or deny a proposed investment in education and infrastructure pursuant to
33 subsection 11. The process must set forth the manner in which the stewardship
34 organization is required to solicit and incorporate input in the development of
35 proposed investments from producers, recycling establishments and participating
36 municipalities.
37 B. At the time that the stewardship organization submits its annual report to the
38 department pursuant to subsection 5, the stewardship organization shall pay to the
39 department a reasonable annual fee established by the department, not to exceed
40 $300,000, to cover the department's costs for review of the stewardship organization's
41 annual report and the department's costs in the prior fiscal year for its oversight,
42 administration and enforcement of the packaging stewardship program. In accordance
43 with subsection 12, paragraph C, the annual fee required under this paragraph may
44 include reimbursement of any costs incurred by the department in adopting rules and
45 in administering and enforcing this section prior to the effective date of the contract
Page 8 - 132LR0987(01)

416 entered into by the department and the stewardship organization pursuant to subsection
427 3.
3 C. A producer or group of producers, when submitting a proposal to the department
4 for the establishment of an alternative collection program or submitting a proposal to
5 the department for modifications to an approved alternative collection program under
6 subsection 8, shall pay to the department a reasonable fee established by the department
7 to cover the department's actual costs for review of the proposal or proposed
8 modifications. A producer or group of producers operating an approved alternative
9 collection program under subsection 8 shall pay to the department a reasonable annual
10 fee established by the department, not to exceed $10,000 per participating producer, to
11 cover the department's costs for review of the producer's or group's annual report and
12 the department's costs for the oversight, administration and enforcement of the
13 alternative collection program, which may be waived by the department if those
14 activities by the department do not require significant department staff time.
15 D. The department shall review packaging material associated with certain federally
16 regulated products to determine whether that packaging material should be excluded
17 from the definition of "packaging material" under subsection 1, paragraph I. In making
18 such a determination, the department shall, at a minimum, consider whether the
19 packaging material for such products is required by federal law or regulation to meet
20 specific content or construction standards that may preclude or significantly diminish
21 the producer's ability to increase the recyclability or reduce the volume of the
22 packaging material. If the department determines that any such product or its
23 associated packaging material should be excluded from the definition of "packaging
24 material," the department shall adopt an exclusion by rule. At a minimum, the
25 department shall conduct a review in accordance with this paragraph of the packaging
26 material associated with the following federally regulated products:
27 (1) Material that is used for the containment, protection, delivery, presentation or
28 distribution of a drug, as that term is defined under Section 321 of the federal Food,
29 Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as regulated by the United States Food and Drug
30 Administration under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or as collected
31 under a stewardship program in the State that has been approved for operation by
32 the department and has been established to collect and dispose of such drugs,
33 including, but not limited to, prescription and nonprescription drugs, drugs in
34 medical devices and combination products, branded and generic drugs and drugs
35 for veterinary use;
36 (2) Material that is a medical device or a biological product, or is used for the
37 containment, protection, delivery, presentation or distribution of a medical device
38 or a biological product, as regulated by the United States Food and Drug
39 Administration under 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 200, 300 and 800;
40 (3) Material that is used for the containment, protection, delivery, presentation or
41 distribution of an over-the-counter human drug product for which tamper-evident
42 packaging is required, as regulated by the United States Food and Drug
43 Administration under 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 211.132; and
44 (4) Material that is used for the containment, protection, delivery, presentation or
45 distribution of a substance regulated by the United States Consumer Product Safety
Page 9 - 132LR0987(01)

416 Commission pursuant to the federal Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 for
427 which special packaging is required under 16 Code of Federal Regulations, Part
438 1700.
4 Rules adopted pursuant to this paragraph are major substantive rules as defined in Title
5 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.
6 E. Beginning February 15, 2025, and annually thereafter, the department shall submit
7 a report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over
8 environment and natural resources matters regarding the packaging stewardship
9 program and alternative collection programs implemented pursuant to this section.
10 (1) The report must include, at a minimum, data on the amount and type of
11 packaging material associated with products sold, offered for sale or distributed for
12 sale in or into the State; data regarding how that packaging material was managed;
13 and any recommendations for amendments to the programs implemented under
14 this section, including, but not limited to, the establishment of new program goals
15 or the imposition of a prohibition on the sale, offer for sale or distribution for sale
16 in or into the State of products associated with packaging material that the
17 department has determined is nonessential, is contaminating collected recyclable
18 material, is a common source of litter or exhibits toxicity, particularly if that
19 toxicity is demonstrated to have a disproportionate impact on any community in
20 the State.
21 (2) Beginning February 15, 2028, and every 5 years thereafter, the report under
22 this paragraph must describe the results of a comprehensive review of the rules
23 adopted by the department pursuant to this section and must include
24 recommendations by the department for any legislative changes to this section
25 determined necessary as a result of that review, including, but not limited to,
26 changes to the flat fee that may be paid by a low-volume producer pursuant to
27 subsection 13, paragraph A, subparagraph (1), division (a), as well as a description
28 of any changes to those rules that the department intends to propose in future
29 rulemaking.
30 (2-A) The report under this paragraph due February 15, 2028 must include:
31 (a) Information regarding the criteria and standards adopted by other
32 jurisdictions to regulate recyclability claims displayed on packaging material,
33 including, but not limited to, the recyclability criteria and standards adopted
34 by the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery pursuant
35 to the California Public Resources Code, Division 30, Part 3, Chapter 5.7; and
36 (b) An evaluation of options for further incentivizing or ensuring accuracy in
37 recyclability claims displayed on packaging material through amendments to
38 the producer payment schedule adopted pursuant to paragraph A, subparagraph
39 (1), through amendments to the criteria and standards for determining
40 recyclability adopted pursuant to paragraph A, subparagraph (2) or through
41 other amendments to this section or the rules adopted pursuant to this section.
42 This subparagraph applies only to the report due February 15, 2028.
43 (3) The report required under this paragraph may be included in the report required
44 pursuant to section 1772, subsection 1.

1 SUMMARY
22 This bill amends the laws governing the State's stewardship program for packaging to
33 exclude certain commercial, cosmetic, medical, environmental, dangerous, hazardous or
44 flammable product packaging and packaging of products related to public health and water
55 quality testing from the requirements of the program and updates the definition of "toxicity"
66 for purposes of the program. The bill requires the Department of Environmental Protection
77 to adopt a process to approve a producer payment system under the program. It also updates
88 the definition of "producer" to add clarification regarding packaging of certain products
99 sold at physical retail locations in the State and via the Internet, remote sale or remote
1100 distribution.
