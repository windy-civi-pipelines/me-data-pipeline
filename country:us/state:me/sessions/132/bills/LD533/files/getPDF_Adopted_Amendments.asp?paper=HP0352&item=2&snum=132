COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 352, L.D. 533
1 The Victims' Reparative Account, referred to in this section as "the account," is
2 established within the department for the purpose of providing a mechanism for offenders
3 to voluntarily make reparations to the victims of their crimes.
4 1. Definitions. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the
5 following terms have the following meanings.
6 A. "Offender" has the same meaning as in Title 17-A, section 2002, subsection 5; and
7 B. "Victim" includes an authorized claimant for restitution described in Title 17-A,
8 section 2004, subsection 1 or 4.
9 2. Administration. The Victim Services Coordinator under section 1214 shall
10 administer the account. Except as otherwise provided in this section, all administrative
11 costs of the account must be absorbed by the department.
12 3. Funding. Money donated by an offender seeking to make reparations to the
13 offender's victims must be deposited into the account and designated to the victim for
14 whose benefit the offender wishes to deposit the money. Money may not be donated to the
15 account by an offender if the donation would affect the offender's ability to pay any
16 court-ordered restitution to all victims of the offender's crimes. Once deposited in the
17 account, an offender may not reclaim the money.
18 4. Use. The Victim Services Coordinator shall ensure that reasonable efforts are made
19 to locate and notify the victim for whose benefit an offender has deposited money into the
20 account. If a victim opts to claim the money deposited for that victim's benefit, a victim
21 may use the money claimed under this section for any purpose.
22 5. Final disposition. If, within 5 years of deposit from an offender, money has not
23 been claimed by the victim for whose benefit the offender has deposited the money, the
24 department may deduct an amount necessary to defray administrative costs of the account
25 and shall transfer the remaining money in the account designated for that victim to the
26 Victims' Compensation Fund established by Title 5, section 3360-H.
27 6. Confidentiality. All records of deposits or claims in the account and the use of the
28 money deposited in accordance with subsections 3 and 4 are confidential and may not be
29 disclosed except by the victim. The records may also be disclosed to employees of the
30 department as necessary for those employees in the performance of any official duty.
31 7. Participation voluntary. The deposit of money in the account by an offender is
32 voluntary. An adverse action may not be threatened or taken against an offender for not
33 depositing funds in the account. An offender may not be offered or given any incentive for
34 participating in the deposit of money in the account and the decision of an offender whether
35 to deposit funds into the account may not be used as either a mitigating or aggravating
36 factor in any decision made by the department. An offender may not disclose the offender's
37 donation of money to the account for any purpose, including to influence a clemency
38 petition. If an offender violates this subsection, the chief administrative officer of the
39 correctional facility shall prohibit the offender from donating to the account.
40 Sec. 3. Appropriations and allocations. The following appropriations and
41 allocations are made.
