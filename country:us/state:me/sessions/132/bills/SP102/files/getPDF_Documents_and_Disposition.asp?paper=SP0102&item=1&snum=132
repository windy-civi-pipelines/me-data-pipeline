In Senate__________
ORDERED, the House concurring, that the Joint Rules be amended by amending Joint
Rule 308 to read:
Rule 308. Reference of Bills to Committee.
All bills and resolves must be referred to committee, except that this provision may be
suspended by a majority vote in each chamber.
1. Legislature in Session. When the Legislature is in session, the Secretary of the Senate
and the Clerk of the House shall jointly suggest an appropriate committee reference for every
bill, resolve and petition offered. The suggested reference must be placed upon the Advance
Journal and Calendar of each chamber. If they are unable to agree, the question of reference
must be referred to a conference of the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House.
Upon their agreement, the suggested reference must be placed upon the Advance Journal and
Calendar of each chamber. If they are unable to agree, the question of suggested reference must
be referred to the Legislative Council for resolution. Upon the decision of the Legislative
Council, the suggested reference must be placed upon the Advance Journal and Calendar of
each chamber.
Each suggested reference appearing upon the Advance Journal and Calendar of each
chamber must contain a recommendation for the printing of the document being referred and
may contain a recommendation on the number of copies of that document to be printed.
Any member may move for reconsideration of a committee reference on the floor.
Notwithstanding Joint Rule 103, a majority vote is necessary to overturn the original committee
of reference.
2. Legislature Not in Session 1. Reference to Committee by Secretary and Clerk.
When the Legislature is not in session or is in recess for more than 4 days Unless the Secretary
of the Senate and Clerk of the House are unable to agree on an appropriate committee reference,
the Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the House may shall refer the bills to the appropriate
joint standing committee for public hearing and order printing, subject to the approval of the
President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House.
Upon reference of a bill to a committee by the Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the
House pursuant to this subsection, if a majority of the chairs and leads of the committee agree,
in advance of scheduling the bill for public hearing, that the reference to that committee is
inappropriate, a communication must be sent to the Senate and House with a recommendation
of "change of committee reference." Upon reference of a bill to a committee pursuant to this
subsection, if a majority of the chairs and leads of the committee agree, in advance of
scheduling the bill for public hearing, that the reference to that committee is appropriate, that
bill remains in that committee. If there is not a majority agreement among the chairs and leads
regarding reference of that bill, the bill is designated for discussion by the committee for a
possible committee report of "refer to another committee" under Joint Rule 310, subsection 2.
Any bill that undergoes a reference determination pursuant to this subsection that is retained
by the committee must be scheduled for a public hearing.
2. Reference in Absence of Agreement Between Secretary and Clerk. If the Secretary
of the Senate and Clerk of the House are unable to agree on an appropriate committee reference,

the question of reference must be referred to a conference of the President of the Senate and
the Speaker of the House. Upon the agreement of the President of the Senate and the Speaker
of the House, the suggested reference must be placed upon the Advance Journal and Calendar
of each chamber. If they are unable to agree, the question of suggested reference must be
referred to the Legislative Council for resolution. Upon the decision of the Legislative Council,
the suggested reference must be placed upon the Advance Journal and Calendar of each
chamber.
If the suggested reference of a bill appears on the Advance Journal and Calendar, any
member may move for reconsideration of a committee reference on the floor. Notwithstanding
Joint Rule 103, a majority vote is necessary to overturn the original committee of reference.
3. Reference to More Than One Committee. When a bill or resolve has a subject matter
that falls within the jurisdiction of more than one committee, suggested references may be made
and the full Legislature may vote to refer a bill or resolve pursuant to this rule to more than one
committee. When references are made to more than one committee, the first named first-named
committee is responsible for the scheduling and conduct of all public hearings, subject to
approval of the chairs of the other committee or committees. Committees to whom a bill or
resolve is referred pursuant to this rule shall participate equally in all public hearings and work
sessions and shall make a joint report or joint reports. The public hearing or hearings and work
session or work sessions must be conducted jointly by both committees. The chairs of the
committees involved shall establish the process for conduct of the work session or work
sessions on the bill. If the chairs are unable to agree, the presiding officers shall establish the
process. The work session process must provide for balanced representation for each
committee. The report or reports on a jointly referred bill is as voted by the full membership of
each committee, except that if a member serves on more than one committee to whom a bill or
resolve is referred, that member may cast only one vote.
