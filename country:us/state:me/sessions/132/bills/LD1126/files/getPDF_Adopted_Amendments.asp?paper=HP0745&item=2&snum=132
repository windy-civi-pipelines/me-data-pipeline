27 SUMMARY
2288 This amendment removes from the bill the Class C crime of knowingly possessing an
2299 undetectable firearm in a courthouse, on school property, in a voting place or in a place
3300 where municipal, county or state business is conducted. The amendment clarifies that the
3311 culpable state of mind for the prohibitions related to undetectable firearms is "intentionally
3322 or knowingly" and that possession of one or more undetectable firearms constitutes a single
3333 violation. The amendment adds an exception to the prohibition for possession of an
3344 undetectable firearm that is a curio or relic. The amendment changes the effective date from
3355 October 1, 2026 to January 1, 2027 for the penalties related to a violation of possessing,
3366 importing, transferring or offering to transfer or purchase a firearm without a serial number.
3377 The amendment reduces the penalty for failing to make a record of an imprinting to a fine
3388 of $250 for a first offense, a fine of $500 for a 2nd offense and a Class E crime for a 3rd or
3399 subsequent offense. The amendment also adds an appropriations and allocations section.
