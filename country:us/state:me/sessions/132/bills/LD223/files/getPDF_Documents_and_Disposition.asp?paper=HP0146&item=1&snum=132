8 C. Credits provided under section 2858; and
9 D. Information relating to the value of facilities and equipment, gross proceeds, net
10 proceeds or other relevant information as the State Tax Assessor may by rule require.
11 3. Payments. A mining company shall pay the tax due, less estimated tax payments
12 and credits, at the time its annual return is due without extensions.
13 4. Extensions. The State Tax Assessor may grant a reasonable extension of time for
14 filing a return, declaration, statement or other document or payment of tax or estimated tax
15 required by this chapter on such terms and conditions as he the assessor may require. The
16 An extension for filing a return, declaration, statement or other document under this chapter
17 may not exceed 8 months, except that, when the mining company is granted an extension
18 of time within which to file a federal income tax return for the tax year, an extension to file
19 the mining company's return with respect to the tax imposed by this chapter is automatically

21 chapter plus 30 days. If an extension of time is granted for payment of an amount of tax
22 under this chapter, the assessor may require the taxpayer to furnish a bond or other security
23 in an amount not exceeding twice the amount for which the extension of time for payment
24 is granted, on terms and conditions the assessor may require.
25 5. Computation. In computing a mining company's tax, gross proceeds and net
26 proceeds shall must be computed as if each mine site mining property were a separate
27 taxpayer. To the extent the mining property is located both in this State and in one or more
28 other states or Canadian provinces, the gross proceeds must be allocated or apportioned in
29 a reasonable manner between the proceeds derived from minerals mined in this State and
30 the proceeds derived from minerals mined in the other jurisdictions. The State Tax Assessor
31 may distribute, apportion or allocate on a reasonable basis gross proceeds, deductions,
32 credits or allowances between or among mining companies or mine sites mining properties,
33 if such distribution, apportionment or allocation is necessary to prevent evasion of taxes
34 imposed by this chapter, or to reasonably reflect clearly the gross or net proceeds of any
35 mining company or mine site from mining activity in the State. For purposes of this
36 paragraph, "mining property" has the same meaning as "property" as defined in Section
37 614 of the Code.
38 6. Requirement to file amended returns. The requirement to file an amended return
39 is governed by this subsection.
40 A. A taxpayer shall file an amended Maine return as required by this subsection when
41 the taxpayer files an amended federal return affecting the taxpayer's liability under this
42 chapter, the Internal Revenue Service changes or corrects any item affecting the
Page 5 - 132LR0239(01)
413 taxpayer's liability under this chapter or for any reason there is a change or correction
424 affecting the taxpayer's liability under this chapter.
3 B. The amended Maine return required pursuant to paragraph A must be filed within
4 180 days from the final determination date of the change or correction or the filing of
5 the federal amended return. For purposes of this paragraph, "final determination date"
6 means, when the taxpayer files an amended federal return affecting the taxpayer's
7 liability under this chapter, the date on which the earliest of the following events occurs
8 with respect to a taxable year for federal income tax purposes:
9 (1) The taxpayer has made payment of an additional income tax liability resulting
10 from a federal audit, the taxpayer has not filed a petition for redetermination or
11 claim for refund for the portions of the audit for which payment was made and the
12 time for filing a petition for redetermination or refund claim has expired;
13 (2) The taxpayer receives a refund from the United States Treasury that resulted
14 from a federal audit;
15 (3) The taxpayer signs Form 870-AD or another Internal Revenue Service form
16 consenting to a deficiency or accepting an overassessment;
17 (4) The taxpayer's time for filing a petition for redetermination with the United
18 States Tax Court expires;
19 (5) The taxpayer and the Internal Revenue Service enter into a closing agreement;
20 (6) A decision from the United States Tax Court, a United States District Court, a
21 federal court of appeals, the United States Court of Federal Claims or the United
22 States Supreme Court becomes final; and
23 (7) The taxpayer files an amended return or similar report pursuant to the Code,
24 Section 6225(c).
25 C. The amended Maine return filed pursuant to this subsection must indicate the
26 change or correction and the reason for that change or correction. The amended return
27 constitutes an admission as to the correctness of the change unless the taxpayer includes
28 with the return a written explanation of the reason the change or correction is erroneous.
29 If the taxpayer files an amended federal income tax return, a copy of the amended
30 federal income tax return must be attached to the amended return under this chapter.
31 D. The assessor may require additional information to be filed with the amended Maine
32 return filed pursuant to this subsection. The assessor may prescribe exceptions to the
33 requirements of this subsection.
34 Sec. 32. 36 MRSA §2857-A is enacted to read:
35 §2857-A. Accounting periods and methods of accounting
36 1. Accounting periods. The determination of a tax year is subject to the following.
37 A. If a taxpayer's tax year is changed for federal income tax purposes, the taxpayer's
38 tax year for purposes of the tax imposed by this chapter must be similarly changed.
39 B. Notwithstanding paragraph A and section 2855, subsection 15, if the assessor makes
40 a determination of jeopardy and terminates the taxpayer's reporting period under
41 section 145, the tax must be computed for the period determined by that action.
Page 6 - 132LR0239(01)
1 2. Method of accounting. The method of accounting used by a taxpayer is subject to
2 this subsection.
3 A. For purposes of the tax imposed by this chapter, a taxpayer's method of accounting
4 must be the same as the taxpayer's method of accounting for federal income tax
5 purposes. If a method of accounting has not been regularly used by the taxpayer, gross
6 income from mining for purposes of this chapter must be computed under a method
7 that in the opinion of the assessor fairly reflects gross proceeds.
8 B. If a taxpayer's method of accounting is changed for federal income tax purposes, the
9 taxpayer's method of accounting for purposes of this chapter must be similarly
10 changed.
11 C. In computing a taxpayer's gross proceeds for any tax year under a method of
12 accounting different from the method under which the taxpayer's gross proceeds for
13 the previous year were computed, there must be taken into account those adjustments
14 that are determined to be necessary solely by reason of the change in order to prevent
15 amounts from being duplicated or omitted.
16 Sec. 33. 36 MRSA §2858, as amended by PL 1987, c. 772, §26, is repealed.
17 Sec. 34. 36 MRSA §2859, as repealed and replaced by PL 1985, c. 691, §§27 and

10 determined in accordance with the portion of the taxpayer's estimated tax liability
11 applicable to that portion of the taxpayer's tax year, completed by the close of the month

13 year.

22 is used to provide grants to municipalities, counties and the unorganized territory to
23 offset the loss of property tax revenue and to provide necessary new or additional
24 public facilities and services related to mining.
25 2. The bill also makes the following changes not included in the Office of Tax Policy's
26 original report:
27 A. It clarifies the imposition and calculation of the mining excise tax;
28 B. It adds administrative provisions regarding extensions, amended returns, accounting
29 periods and estimated tax payments; and
30 C. It eliminates the Mining Oversight Fund and requires that, of the mining excise tax
31 revenue, 75% is deposited in the Land for Maine's Future Trust Fund and 25% is
32 deposited in the General Fund.

Page 4 - 132LR0239(01)

1 §2857. Returns
2 1. Annual return. A mining company shall file, on or before the date the mining
3 company's state income tax return is due to be filed, an annual return on a form specified
4 by the State Tax Assessor for each tax year.
5 2. Form and contents. The return shall must indicate:
6 A. The tax due;
7 B. The estimated tax payments made; and
8 C. Credits provided under section 2858; and
9 D. Information relating to the value of facilities and equipment, gross proceeds, net
10 proceeds or other relevant information as the State Tax Assessor may by rule require.
11 3. Payments. A mining company shall pay the tax due, less estimated tax payments
12 and credits, at the time its annual return is due without extensions.
13 4. Extensions. The State Tax Assessor may grant a reasonable extension of time for
14 filing a return, declaration, statement or other document or payment of tax or estimated tax
15 required by this chapter on such terms and conditions as he the assessor may require. The
16 An extension for filing a return, declaration, statement or other document under this chapter
17 may not exceed 8 months, except that, when the mining company is granted an extension
18 of time within which to file a federal income tax return for the tax year, an extension to file
19 the mining company's return with respect to the tax imposed by this chapter is automatically
20 granted for an equivalent period from the date prescribed for filing the return under this
21 chapter plus 30 days. If an extension of time is granted for payment of an amount of tax
22 under this chapter, the assessor may require the taxpayer to furnish a bond or other security
23 in an amount not exceeding twice the amount for which the extension of time for payment
24 is granted, on terms and conditions the assessor may require.
25 5. Computation. In computing a mining company's tax, gross proceeds and net
26 proceeds shall must be computed as if each mine site mining property were a separate
27 taxpayer. To the extent the mining property is located both in this State and in one or more
28 other states or Canadian provinces, the gross proceeds must be allocated or apportioned in
29 a reasonable manner between the proceeds derived from minerals mined in this State and
30 the proceeds derived from minerals mined in the other jurisdictions. The State Tax Assessor
31 may distribute, apportion or allocate on a reasonable basis gross proceeds, deductions,
32 credits or allowances between or among mining companies or mine sites mining properties,
33 if such distribution, apportionment or allocation is necessary to prevent evasion of taxes
34 imposed by this chapter, or to reasonably reflect clearly the gross or net proceeds of any
35 mining company or mine site from mining activity in the State. For purposes of this
36 paragraph, "mining property" has the same meaning as "property" as defined in Section
37 614 of the Code.
38 6. Requirement to file amended returns. The requirement to file an amended return
39 is governed by this subsection.
40 A. A taxpayer shall file an amended Maine return as required by this subsection when
41 the taxpayer files an amended federal return affecting the taxpayer's liability under this
42 chapter, the Internal Revenue Service changes or corrects any item affecting the
Page 5 - 132LR0239(01)

413 taxpayer's liability under this chapter or for any reason there is a change or correction
424 affecting the taxpayer's liability under this chapter.
3 B. The amended Maine return required pursuant to paragraph A must be filed within
4 180 days from the final determination date of the change or correction or the filing of
5 the federal amended return. For purposes of this paragraph, "final determination date"
6 means, when the taxpayer files an amended federal return affecting the taxpayer's
7 liability under this chapter, the date on which the earliest of the following events occurs
8 with respect to a taxable year for federal income tax purposes:
9 (1) The taxpayer has made payment of an additional income tax liability resulting
10 from a federal audit, the taxpayer has not filed a petition for redetermination or
11 claim for refund for the portions of the audit for which payment was made and the
12 time for filing a petition for redetermination or refund claim has expired;
13 (2) The taxpayer receives a refund from the United States Treasury that resulted
14 from a federal audit;
15 (3) The taxpayer signs Form 870-AD or another Internal Revenue Service form
16 consenting to a deficiency or accepting an overassessment;
17 (4) The taxpayer's time for filing a petition for redetermination with the United
18 States Tax Court expires;
19 (5) The taxpayer and the Internal Revenue Service enter into a closing agreement;
20 (6) A decision from the United States Tax Court, a United States District Court, a
21 federal court of appeals, the United States Court of Federal Claims or the United
22 States Supreme Court becomes final; and
23 (7) The taxpayer files an amended return or similar report pursuant to the Code,
24 Section 6225(c).
25 C. The amended Maine return filed pursuant to this subsection must indicate the
26 change or correction and the reason for that change or correction. The amended return
27 constitutes an admission as to the correctness of the change unless the taxpayer includes
28 with the return a written explanation of the reason the change or correction is erroneous.
29 If the taxpayer files an amended federal income tax return, a copy of the amended
30 federal income tax return must be attached to the amended return under this chapter.
31 D. The assessor may require additional information to be filed with the amended Maine
32 return filed pursuant to this subsection. The assessor may prescribe exceptions to the
33 requirements of this subsection.
34 Sec. 32. 36 MRSA §2857-A is enacted to read:
35 §2857-A. Accounting periods and methods of accounting
36 1. Accounting periods. The determination of a tax year is subject to the following.
37 A. If a taxpayer's tax year is changed for federal income tax purposes, the taxpayer's
38 tax year for purposes of the tax imposed by this chapter must be similarly changed.
39 B. Notwithstanding paragraph A and section 2855, subsection 15, if the assessor makes
40 a determination of jeopardy and terminates the taxpayer's reporting period under
41 section 145, the tax must be computed for the period determined by that action.
Page 6 - 132LR0239(01)

1 2. Method of accounting. The method of accounting used by a taxpayer is subject to
2 this subsection.
3 A. For purposes of the tax imposed by this chapter, a taxpayer's method of accounting
4 must be the same as the taxpayer's method of accounting for federal income tax
5 purposes. If a method of accounting has not been regularly used by the taxpayer, gross
6 income from mining for purposes of this chapter must be computed under a method
7 that in the opinion of the assessor fairly reflects gross proceeds.
8 B. If a taxpayer's method of accounting is changed for federal income tax purposes, the
9 taxpayer's method of accounting for purposes of this chapter must be similarly
10 changed.
11 C. In computing a taxpayer's gross proceeds for any tax year under a method of
12 accounting different from the method under which the taxpayer's gross proceeds for
13 the previous year were computed, there must be taken into account those adjustments
14 that are determined to be necessary solely by reason of the change in order to prevent
15 amounts from being duplicated or omitted.
16 Sec. 33. 36 MRSA §2858, as amended by PL 1987, c. 772, §26, is repealed.
17 Sec. 34. 36 MRSA §2859, as repealed and replaced by PL 1985, c. 691, §§27 and

19 §2859. Estimated tax requirements
20 1. Definitions. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the
21 following terms have the following meanings.
22 A. "Allowable credits" means the total amount of payments by a taxpayer that have
23 been or will be paid to the bureau prior to the date the payment against which they are
24 to be used as a credit is due and that are available to offset any tax liability estimated
25 under this chapter.
26 B. "Estimated tax" means the total amount of tax that a person estimates will be due
27 for a tax year under this chapter, after subtracting allowable credits for that tax year.
28 C. "Period of underpayment" means the period of time from the date an estimated tax
29 installment is due until the underpayment is satisfied or until the tax return to which
30 the estimated tax installment applies is due, whichever is less.
31 2. Requirement to pay estimated tax. A person subject to taxation under this chapter
32 shall make payment of estimated tax as required by this chapter. The requirement to make
33 estimated tax payments is waived if:
34 A. The person's tax liability pursuant to this chapter reduced by allowable credits for
35 the tax year is less than $1,000 for the tax year; or
36 B. The person had less than $1,000 tax liability under this chapter for the immediately
37 preceding tax year.
38 3. Amount of estimated tax to be paid. A person required to make payment of
39 estimated tax under this chapter is liable for an estimated tax that is no less than the lesser
40 of:
Page 7 - 132LR0239(01)

1 A. An amount equal to the person's tax liability under this chapter for the immediately
2 preceding tax year, if that preceding year was a tax year of 12 months; and
3 B. An amount equal to 90% of the person's tax liability under this chapter for the
4 current tax year.
5 4. Amount of installment. The amount of estimated tax to be paid in a tax year by a
6 taxpayer is to be paid in installments by the dates established in this section. The amount
7 of the estimated tax is to be paid in 4 equal installments unless the taxpayer establishes by
8 adequate record the actual distribution of tax liability and allowable credits, or both, in
9 which case the amount of the installment payments must be adjusted accordingly and be

7 SUMMARY
88 In Resolve 2023, chapter 83, the Department of Administrative and Financial Services,
99 Bureau of Revenue Services, Office of Tax Policy was required to review the State's
1100 taxation of metallic mineral mining and submit a report to the Joint Standing Committee
1111 on Taxation in the Second Regular Session of the 131st Legislature.
12 1. This bill implements the changes proposed in the legislation accompanying the
13 report, including providing for the refund of sales tax on depreciable machinery and
14 equipment purchases and also:
15 A. Exempting unextracted minerals from the property tax;
16 B. Simplifying the excise tax imposed on a mining company by establishing a formula
17 of the gross proceeds of that mining company multiplied by 0.05; repealing the
18 definition of "mineral products"; clarifying the definition of "tax year" for purposes of
19 the mining excise tax; incorporating various administrative provisions; and eliminating
20 credits for payment of certain property taxes and prepayment of taxes; and
21 C. Eliminating the Mining Impact Assistance Fund and related provisions. The fund
22 is used to provide grants to municipalities, counties and the unorganized territory to
23 offset the loss of property tax revenue and to provide necessary new or additional
24 public facilities and services related to mining.
25 2. The bill also makes the following changes not included in the Office of Tax Policy's
26 original report:
27 A. It clarifies the imposition and calculation of the mining excise tax;
28 B. It adds administrative provisions regarding extensions, amended returns, accounting
29 periods and estimated tax payments; and
30 C. It eliminates the Mining Oversight Fund and requires that, of the mining excise tax
31 revenue, 75% is deposited in the Land for Maine's Future Trust Fund and 25% is
32 deposited in the General Fund.
