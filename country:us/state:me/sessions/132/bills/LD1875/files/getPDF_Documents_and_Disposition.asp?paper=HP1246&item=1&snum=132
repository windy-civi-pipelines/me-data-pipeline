22 electric vehicle pursuant to Title 29-A, section 501 shall complete, at the same time, a
23 mileage registration form provided by the bureau stating the mileage of the electric vehicle

33 registration form, shall calculate the fee due from each registrant of an electric vehicle
34 pursuant to this subsection.
35 A. The bureau shall subtract from the mileage stated on the most recently received
36 mileage reimbursement form the mileage stated on the mileage reimbursement form
37 filed for that electric vehicle for the immediately prior year. This is the net mileage.
38 B. The bureau shall multiple the net mileage under paragraph A by:
Page 1 - 132LR1205(01)

1 (1) For battery electric vehicles, 1.0¢; and
2 (2) For plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, 0.5¢.
3 This amount is the electric vehicle road use fee.
4 C. The bureau shall notify the registrant of the electric vehicle of the amount of the
5 electric vehicle road use fee under paragraph B, that the registrant has 45 days to pay
6 the electric vehicle road use fee and that failure to pay will result in the suspension of
7 the registration of the electric vehicle for which the fee is due.
8 D. A registrant shall pay the electric vehicle road use fee within 45 days of receipt of
9 notice provided pursuant to paragraph C. Payment must be made to the bureau.
10 E. Notwithstanding paragraph B, if the amount of the gasoline tax changes from 30.0¢
11 per gallon, the assessor shall adjust the multipliers specified in paragraph B,

13 vehicle road use fee.

15 5. Electric Vehicle Road Use Fee Fund. The Electric Vehicle Road Use Fee Fund is
16 established as a nonlapsing fund within the bureau.

21 the amount of funds in the fund as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar
22 year and the amount of revenue collected from the gasoline tax imposed for that same
23 time period.
24 B. Using the amounts determined pursuant to paragraph A, the assessor shall divide
25 the amount of funds in the fund by the amount of revenue received from the gasoline
26 tax. The result must be multiplied by the number of days in the calendar year.
27 C. The result of the calculation performed pursuant to paragraph B, rounded to the
28 nearest whole number, is the number of days that the gasoline tax must be suspended
29 in the calendar year in which the calculation is performed.
30 D. The assessor shall inform the Governor and the joint standing committees of the
31 Legislature having jurisdiction over transportation matters and taxation matters of the
32 number of days of suspension of the gasoline tax required pursuant to paragraph C.
33 E. The Governor shall determine the date or dates on which the gasoline tax is
34 suspended, which must occur in the same calendar year in which the assessor informs
35 the Governor pursuant to paragraph D, and by proclamation shall announce the date or
36 dates of the suspension, notwithstanding section 2903.
37 7. Rules. The assessor shall adopt routine technical rules in accordance with Title 5,
38 chapter 375, subchapter 2-A to implement this chapter.
39 SUMMARY
4400 This bill imposes a road use fee on battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric
4411 vehicles based on the number of miles the vehicle is driven in a year. A person registering
Page 2 - 132LR1205(01)

412 an electric vehicle is required to complete at the same time a form stating the mileage of
423 the electric vehicle and submit the form to the municipality in which the electric vehicle is
434 registered. The Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Revenue
445 Services is required, based on the mileage accumulated by that electric vehicle during the
456 prior registration period, to assess the person registering that electric vehicle a fee, which
467 for battery electric vehicles is 1.0¢ per mile and for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles is 0.5¢
478 per mile. The per mile rate is tied to the gasoline tax rate imposed on internal combustion
489 engine fuel of 30.0¢ per gallon; if that rate changes, the per mile electric vehicle rate also
590 changes.
10 Revenue collected from the electric vehicle road use fee is used to temporarily suspend
11 the gasoline tax for the number of days equivalent to a ratio of fees to total gasoline tax
12 revenue. The Governor is required to determine and announce the dates of the suspension.
