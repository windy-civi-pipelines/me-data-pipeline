25 authorizes the limited liability company or foreign limited liability company to resume
26 transaction of business. After that certificate is filed, the limited liability company or

32 comply with this section a check box indicating whether a purpose of the limited liability
33 company or foreign limited liability company is to provide one or more residential rental
34 units under subsection 1, paragraph F. Beginning January 1, 2027, the Secretary of State
35 shall include with the annual report form a form requesting from a limited liability company
36 or foreign limited liability company that checked the residential rental unit check box under
37 this subsection information required under Title 14, section 6030-K, subsection 2.

41 administrative expenses of the residential rental unit registry under Title 14, section 6030-K
42 based upon the number of entities that mark the check box under Title 13-B, section 1301,
43 subsection 7; Title 13-C, section 1621, subsection 7; Title 31, section 873, subsection 4;

1 Sec. 32. Effective date. Those sections of this Act that enact the Maine Revised

3 paragraph H; and Title 14, section 6030-K take effect January 1, 2028.
4 SUMMARY
55 This bill creates a residential rental unit registry administered by the Secretary of State
66 in which all residential rental property owners in the State must register all residential rental
77 units except for units provided as subsidized housing or registered on a municipal registry.
88 A municipality may receive data from the registry regarding rental units in that
99 municipality. A residential landlord may not terminate a tenant's lease for nonpayment of
1100 rent if the tenant's unit is not registered as required and may not serve the tenant with a
1111 notice of termination for nonpayment of rent less than 120 days after registering; in either
1122 case, the residential landlord commits a civil violation for which a fine in the amount of 3
1133 times the rent of the unit must be adjudged. The landlord must attach a statement describing
1144 the prohibition in any service of process for entry and detainer being served on a tenant.

4 SUMMARY
55 This bill creates a residential rental unit registry administered by the Secretary of State
66 in which all residential rental property owners in the State must register all residential rental
77 units except for units provided as subsidized housing or registered on a municipal registry.
88 A municipality may receive data from the registry regarding rental units in that
99 municipality. A residential landlord may not terminate a tenant's lease for nonpayment of
1100 rent if the tenant's unit is not registered as required and may not serve the tenant with a
1111 notice of termination for nonpayment of rent less than 120 days after registering; in either
1122 case, the residential landlord commits a civil violation for which a fine in the amount of 3
1133 times the rent of the unit must be adjudged. The landlord must attach a statement describing
1144 the prohibition in any service of process for entry and detainer being served on a tenant.
