4 9. Tobacco products. "Tobacco products" means any products that are made from or

6 not limited to, cigars, including premium cigars; cheroots; stogies; electronic smoking
7 devices and liquids used in electronic smoking devices whether or not they contain

14 SUMMARY
1155 This bill modifies the tobacco products tax by eliminating the tax imposed on certain
1166 products that contain nicotine but not tobacco.
17 Current law provides a general definition for "tobacco products" as well as a list of
18 specific types of products that are included in that definition. This bill modifies the general
19 definition to remove language that would allow products that contain either natural or
20 artificial nicotine, but not tobacco, to be taxable. The bill does not alter the list of specific
21 products that are taxable, including electronic smoking devices, whether or not they contain
22 nicotine.
