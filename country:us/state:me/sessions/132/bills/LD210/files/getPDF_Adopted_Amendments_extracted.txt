7 requirements, restrictions or burdens upon the 340B entity that differ from the terms and

17 issuer, pharmacy benefits manager or other 3rd-party payor and a 340B entity that differs

19 discriminates against the 340B entity that participates in the 340B program or prevents or
20 interferes with a patient's choice to receive a 340B drug from a 340B entity, whether by
21 direct administration, in-person dispensing, direct delivery, mail or other form of shipment;
22 6. Restrictions or additional charges prohibited. Place a restriction or additional
23 charge on a patient who chooses to receive 340B drugs from a 340B entity if the restriction

26 pharmacy that is not a 340B contract pharmacy;
27 7. Submission of data pertaining to ingredient costs or pricing of 340B drugs

34 for reasons other than those that apply equally to entities that are not 340B entities.
35 This section may not be construed to limit a health insurance issuer's ability to use
36 certain preferred pharmacies or develop networks of preferred pharmacies as long as a
37 health insurance issuer's decision is not based on an entity's status as a 340B entity.
