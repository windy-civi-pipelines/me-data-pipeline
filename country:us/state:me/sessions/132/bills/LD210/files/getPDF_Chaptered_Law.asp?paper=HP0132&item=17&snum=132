and multimunicipal regions, referred to in this subchapter as "the program," is established
to encourage and facilitate the adoption and implementation of local, regional and statewide
growth management programs. Under the provisions of the program, a municipality or
multimunicipal region may request financial or technical assistance from the office for the
Page 237 - 132LR2409(17)

purpose of planning and implementing a growth management program. A municipality or
multimunicipal region that requests and receives a financial assistance grant shall develop
and implement its growth management program in cooperation with the office and in a
manner consistent with the procedures, goals and guidelines established in this subchapter
and in Title 30-A, chapter 187, subchapter 2.
To accomplish the purposes of this subchapter, the office shall develop and administer
the program. The program must include direct financial assistance for planning and
implementation of growth management programs, standards governing the review of
growth management programs by the office, technical assistance to municipalities or
multimunicipal regions and a voluntary certification program for growth management
programs.
§3232. Technical and financial assistance
The office may enter into financial assistance grants under the program only to the
extent that funds are available. In making grants, the office shall consider the need for
planning in a municipality or multimunicipal region, the proximity of the municipality or
multimunicipal region to other areas that are conducting or have completed the planning
process and the economic and geographic role of the municipality or multimunicipal region
within a regional context. The office shall give priority in making grants to any
municipality or multimunicipal region that has adopted a local climate action plan and, if
the municipality or multimunicipal region has adopted a comprehensive plan or growth
management program, prepared a climate vulnerability assessment pursuant to Title 30-A,
section 4326, subsection 1, paragraph L. The office may consider other criteria in making
grants, as long as the criteria support the goal of encouraging and facilitating the adoption
and implementation of local and multimunicipal growth management programs consistent
with the procedures, goals and guidelines established in this subchapter.

A. Provide for the payment of a specific amount for the purposes of planning and
preparing a comprehensive plan;
B. Provide for the payment of a specific amount for the purposes of implementing a
comprehensive plan; and
C. Include specific timetables governing the preparation and submission of products
by the municipality or multimunicipal region.
The office may not require a municipality or multimunicipal region to provide matching
funds in excess of 25% of the value of that municipality's or multimunicipal region's
financial assistance contract for its first planning assistance grant and implementation
assistance grant. The office may require a higher match for other grants, including, but not
limited to, grants for the purpose of updating comprehensive plans. This match limitation
does not apply to distribution of federal funds that the office may administer.
2. Use of funds. A municipality or multimunicipal region may expend financial
assistance grants for:
A. The conduct of surveys, inventories and other data-gathering activities;
B. The hiring of planning and other technical staff;

region that is directly related to the preparation of a comprehensive plan or the
implementation of a comprehensive plan adopted in accordance with the procedures,
goals and guidelines established in this subchapter.
3. Program evaluation. Any recipient of a financial assistance grant shall cooperate
with the office in performing program evaluations required under Title 30-A, section 4331.
4. Encumbered balances at year-end. Notwithstanding Title 5, section 1589, at the
end of each fiscal year, all encumbered balances accounts for financial assistance and
regional planning grants may be carried forward for 2 years beyond the year in which those
balances are encumbered.
5. Technical assistance. Using its own staff, the staff of other state agencies,
contractors and the resources of the regional councils, the office shall provide technical
assistance to municipalities or multimunicipal regions in the development, administration
and enforcement of growth management programs. The technical assistance component of
the program must include a set of model land use ordinances or other implementation
strategies developed by the office that are consistent with this subchapter.
6. Regional council assistance. As part of the program, the office may develop and
administer an initiative to develop regional education and training programs, regional
policies to address state goals and regional assessments. Regional assessments may include,
but are not limited to, public infrastructure, inventories of agricultural and commercial
forest lands, housing needs, recreation and open space needs and projections of regional
growth and economic development. The initiative may include guidelines to ensure
methodological consistency among the State's regional councils. To implement this
initiative, the office may contract with regional councils to assist the office in reviewing
growth management programs, to develop necessary planning information at a regional
level or to provide support for local planning efforts.
7. Coordination. State agencies with regulatory or other authority affecting the goals
established in this subchapter shall conduct their respective activities in a manner consistent
with the goals established under this subchapter, including, but not limited to, coordinating
with municipalities, regional councils and other state agencies in meeting the state goals;
providing available information to regions and municipalities as described in Title 30-A,
section 4326, subsection 1; cooperating with efforts to integrate and provide access to
geographic information system data; making state investments and awarding grant money

§3233. Municipal planning assistance program; review of programs
1. Comprehensive plans. A municipality or multimunicipal region that chooses to
prepare a growth management program and receives a planning grant under Title 30-A,
chapter 187, subchapter 2 shall submit its comprehensive plan to the office for review. A
municipality or multimunicipal region that chooses to prepare a growth management
program without receiving a planning grant under this subchapter may submit its
comprehensive plan to the office for review. The office shall review plans for consistency
with the procedures, goals and guidelines established in Title 30-A, chapter 187, subchapter
2. A contract for a planning assistance grant must include specific timetables governing the
review of the comprehensive plan by the office. A comprehensive plan submitted for
review more than 12 months following a contract end date may be required to contain data,
projections and other time-sensitive portions of the plan or program that are in compliance
with the office's most current review standards.
2. Growth management programs. A municipality or multimunicipal region may at
any time request a certificate of consistency for its growth management program.
A. Upon a request for review under this section, the office shall review the program
and determine whether the program is consistent with the procedures, goals and
guidelines established in Title 30-A, chapter 187, subchapter 2.
B. Certification by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry or the
office of a municipality's or multimunicipal region's growth management program
under Title 30-A, chapter 187, subchapter 2 is valid for 10 years. To maintain
certification, a municipality or multimunicipal region shall periodically review its
growth management program and submit to the office in a timely manner any revisions
necessary to account for changes, including changes caused by growth and
development. Certification does not lapse in any year in which the Legislature does not
appropriate funds to the office for the purposes of reviewing programs for
recertification.
C. Upon a request for review under this section, the office may review rate of growth,
impact fee and zoning ordinances to determine whether the ordinances are consistent
with a comprehensive plan that has been found consistent under this section without
requiring submission of all elements of a growth management program. An affirmative
finding of consistency by the office is required for a municipality or multimunicipal
region to assert jurisdiction as provided in section 3234.
Page 240 - 132LR2409(17)

3. Review of growth management program. In reviewing a growth management
program, the office shall:

(3) Notwithstanding paragraph D, if a municipality or multimunicipal region
requests a certificate of consistency for its growth management program, any
unmodified component of that program that has previously been reviewed by the
Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and has received a finding
of consistency must retain that finding during program certification review by the
office as long as the finding of consistency is current as defined in rules adopted
by the office;
D. Provide ample opportunity for the municipality or multimunicipal region submitting
a growth management program to respond to and correct any identified deficiencies in
