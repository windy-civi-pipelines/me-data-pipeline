6 chapter as "the commission.," is established as a public body corporate and politic and an
7 incorporated public instrumentality of the State. The exercise of powers conferred by this

10 such other officers as may be necessary to conduct its business. Four members
11 constitute a quorum.
12 (1) Three members must be members of the state board, appointed by the state
13 board for 3‑year terms, and the other 4 members are appointed by the Governor,
14 subject to review by the joint standing committee of the Legislature having
15 jurisdiction over education matters and to confirmation by the Senate, for 4-year
16 terms.

23 superintendent, teacher and special education director.
24 (3) A commission member may not serve more than 3 consecutive terms, but may
25 serve again after not serving on the commission for at least one term.

33 in which the vacancy occurs is regularly filled. A vacancy is filled for the
34 remainder of the unexpired term. If the person serves more than 1 1/2 years of an
35 unexpired term, that service counts as one term for purposes of the limitation set
36 forth in subparagraph (3).
37 (7) A member of the commission may be removed for failure to perform the duties
38 of office, as specified in commission rules, by a majority vote of the state board.
