1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 30-A MRSA §3015 is enacted to read:
3 §3015. Heating or energy system
4 Unless otherwise authorized by statute, a municipality may not adopt any ordinance or
5 regulation that prohibits the use of a safe and commercially available heating or energy
6 system of an individual's or entity's choice to serve the individual's or entity's heating or
7 energy needs, including the heating or energy needs of a motor vehicle, or that prohibits
8 the individual or entity from engaging the services of a person or energy distributor to
9 install, connect, service or resupply such a system. As used in this section, "energy
10 distributor" means an individual or entity allowed to distribute or supply oil, propane,
11 natural gas or wood or renewable resources or other related energy services to consumers
12 in the State and "renewable resources" has the same meaning as in Title 35-A, section 3210,
13 subsection 2, paragraph C.
14 This section does not limit the authority of a municipality to encourage the use of a
15 particular type of heating or energy system or to spend funds in support of a particular type
16 of heating or energy system. This section does not exempt any person or energy distributor
17 that installs, connects, services or resupplies a heating or energy system from applicable
18 licensing or other requirements governing such activities.
19 SUMMARY

2211 heating or energy system for that individual's or entity's own heating or energy needs,
2222 including the heating or energy needs of a motor vehicle, or engaging the services of a
2233 person or energy distributor of that individual's or entity's choice unless the prohibition is
