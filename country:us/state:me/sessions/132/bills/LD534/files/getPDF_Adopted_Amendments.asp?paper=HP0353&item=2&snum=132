13 SUMMARY
1144 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, replaces the bill. The
1155 amendment requires the Chief of the State Police to adopt rules regarding communications
1166 between professional investigators and victims and witnesses. These rules require a
1177 professional investigator, prior to seeking information from a victim or witness
1188 substantially related to the crime to which that person is a victim or witness, to disclose to
1199 the victim or witness the purpose of the investigation; the name of the person who hired
2200 the professional investigator; that the victim is not required to speak with the professional
2211 investigator; and, if the professional investigator is employed by the Maine Commission
2222 on Public Defense Services or by any criminal defense attorney, that the professional
2233 investigator is working for the benefit of the defendant. The amendment also requires that
2244 a professional investigator that is employed by or on behalf of the Maine Commission on
2255 Public Defense Services may not act as a professional investigator without obtaining from
2266 the Chief of the State Police a license to be a professional investigator. The amendment
2277 also adds an appropriations and allocations section.
