1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 5 MRSA §1511, as corrected by RR 2023, c. 2, Pt. A, §12, is amended to
3 read:
4 §1511. Loan Insurance Reserve
5 The State Controller may, at the close of each fiscal year, as the next priority after the
6 transfers authorized pursuant to section 1507, transfer from the unappropriated surplus of
7 the General Fund to the Loan Insurance Reserve amounts as may be available from time to
8 time, up to an amount of $1,000,000 per year after the transfers have been made pursuant
9 to section 1507. The balance of this reserve must be paid to the Finance Authority of Maine
10 if such payment does not cause the balance in the reserve fund maintained by the authority,
11 when added to amounts held in the Finance Authority of Maine Mortgage Insurance Fund
12 that are not committed or encumbered for another purpose, to exceed $50,000,000
13 $65,000,000. Any balance in the Loan Insurance Reserve is appropriated for this purpose.
14 SUMMARY
1155 This bill increases the combined amount that the Finance Authority of Maine may have
1166 in its Loan Insurance Reserve and Finance Authority of Maine Mortgage Insurance Fund
1177 from $50,000,000 to $65,000,000 and still receive a statutory transfer from the General
1188 Fund. Below this amount, a transfer of up to $1,000,000 from the unappropriated surplus
1199 of the General Fund is allowed under certain circumstances.
