12 Section 922(g)(1) or section 393, subsection 1, paragraph A-1 or C from owning,
13 possessing or having under the person's control a firearm as the result of a criminal
14 conviction or adjudication by a court in this State, 10 years after the date of final discharge
15 from any sentence imposed as a result of the conviction or adjudication, becomes eligible
16 to apply for a restoration of the person's civil rights in accordance with subsection 3. To be
17 eligible for a restoration of civil rights under subsection 3, a person must satisfy the
18 following conditions:
19 A. The person has not been convicted or adjudicated of a felony crime in this State or
20 in another jurisdiction prior to or concurrently with the underlying conviction or

40 requirements of subsection 2 may submit a request to the department to have restored the

42 of a request, the department shall conduct a review of the person's criminal history to ensure
Page 4 - 132LR1532(01)
413 the person is eligible under subsection 2. Upon a determination that the person is eligible,
424 the department shall notify the court having jurisdiction over the crime on which the

6 restoring the civil rights of a person pursuant to subsection 3, that person is no longer
7 prohibited from owning, possessing or having under that person's control a firearm under
8 section 393, subsection 1, paragraph A-1 or C. Restoration of civil rights under this section
9 is within the meaning of civil rights restored under the federal Firearms Owners' Protection
10 Act, 18 United States Code, Section 921(a)(20).
11 5. Subsequent conviction. If a person who has had the person's civil rights restored
12 under this section is subsequently convicted of any felony crime in this State or in another
13 jurisdiction, the person's right to own, possess and have under that person's control a
14 firearm is revoked, the person is ineligible from qualifying for a restoration of civil rights
15 under this section and the court that issued the order restoring the person's rights under
16 subsection 3 shall revoke the order.
17 SUMMARY
1188 Currently, persons who have been convicted of committing or found not criminally
1199 responsible by reason of insanity of committing a crime in this State, a crime under the
2200 laws of the United States and certain crimes in other jurisdictions that are punishable by a
2211 term of imprisonment of one year or more are prohibited from owning, possessing or
2222 having under their control a firearm. This bill restores the right for some of these convicted
2233 persons to own, possess and have a firearm under their control, setting certain eligibility
2244 requirements a person must meet to have their civil rights relating to firearms restored,
2255 including a requirement that 10 years have passed since the completion of any sentence
2266 imposed on them. Eligibility for restoration of firearm rights is excluded for certain
2277 enumerated categories of crimes, including murder; any Class A crime; any Class B or C
2288 crime in violation of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17-A, chapter 9, 11, 12, 13, 33 or
2299 45; robbery; assault on an officer; assault on an emergency medical services person; assault
3300 on a firefighter; aggravated sex trafficking; and sex trafficking.
31 The bill also outlines the procedure for applying for a restoration of civil rights. A
32 person meeting the eligibility requirements may submit a request to the Department of
33 Public Safety to have that person's firearm rights restored. Upon receipt of a request, the
34 department must conduct a review of the person's criminal history to ensure the person is
35 eligible. Upon a determination that the person is eligible, the department must notify the
36 court having jurisdiction over the crime on which the person's firearm prohibition is based,
37 and that court must issue an order restoring the person's rights.
38 The bill also stipulates that, in the event a person who has had the person's civil rights
39 restored is subsequently convicted of any felony crime, defined as a crime punishable by a
40 sentence of imprisonment of one year or more in Maine or any other jurisdiction, that
41 person's restored rights are revoked and the person is ineligible from qualifying for a
42 restoration of that person's rights in the future. In this occurrence, the court that issued the
43 order restoring the person's civil rights to own, possess and have under the person's control
44 a firearm must revoke that order.

3 substantially similar to a crime in this State that is punishable by a term of
4 imprisonment of one year or more.
5 D. "Final discharge" means the completion by a person of all authorized sentences
6 imposed as a result of a criminal conviction, including, but not limited to, a sentence
7 of imprisonment, a period of administrative release, a period of supervised release, a
8 period of probation, community service and the full payment of any fine or restitution.
9 E. "Firearm" has the same meaning as in Title 17-A, section 2, subsection 12-A.
10 2. Eligibility for restoration of civil rights. Except as provided in subsection 5, a
11 person prohibited pursuant to the federal Gun Control Act of 1968, 18 United States Code,
12 Section 922(g)(1) or section 393, subsection 1, paragraph A-1 or C from owning,
13 possessing or having under the person's control a firearm as the result of a criminal
14 conviction or adjudication by a court in this State, 10 years after the date of final discharge
15 from any sentence imposed as a result of the conviction or adjudication, becomes eligible
16 to apply for a restoration of the person's civil rights in accordance with subsection 3. To be
17 eligible for a restoration of civil rights under subsection 3, a person must satisfy the
18 following conditions:
19 A. The person has not been convicted or adjudicated of a felony crime in this State or
20 in another jurisdiction prior to or concurrently with the underlying conviction or
21 adjudication;
22 B. The person has not been convicted or adjudicated of any crime in this State or in
23 another jurisdiction for a period of 10 years since the date of final discharge from any
24 sentence imposed as a result of the underlying conviction or adjudication and is not
25 subject to any adjudication for committing a crime in this State or in another
26 jurisdiction; and
27 C. The underlying criminal conviction or adjudication is for a Class B or Class C crime,
28 except that if the underlying conviction or adjudication is for any of the following Class
29 B or Class C crimes, the person is not eligible to apply under subsection 3:
30 (1) Any Class B or Class C crime in violation of Title 17-A, chapter 9, 11, 12, 13,
31 33 or 45;
32 (2) Robbery in violation of Title 17-A, section 651;
33 (3) Assault on an officer in violation of Title 17-A, section 752-A;
34 (4) Assault on an emergency medical services person in violation of Title 17-A,
35 section 752-C;
36 (5) Assault on a firefighter in violation of Title 17-A, section 752-E;
37 (6) Aggravated sex trafficking in violation of Title 17-A, section 852; or
38 (7) Sex trafficking in violation of Title 17-A, section 853.
39 3. Application for restoration of civil rights. A person meeting the eligibility
40 requirements of subsection 2 may submit a request to the department to have restored the
41 person's right to own, possess and have under the person's control a firearm. Upon receipt
42 of a request, the department shall conduct a review of the person's criminal history to ensure
Page 4 - 132LR1532(01)

413 the person is eligible under subsection 2. Upon a determination that the person is eligible,
424 the department shall notify the court having jurisdiction over the crime on which the
435 person's firearm prohibition is based, and that court shall issue an order restoring the
446 person's right to own, possess and have under the person's control a firearm.
5 4. Effect of restoration. Except as provided in subsection 5, if a court issues an order
6 restoring the civil rights of a person pursuant to subsection 3, that person is no longer
7 prohibited from owning, possessing or having under that person's control a firearm under
8 section 393, subsection 1, paragraph A-1 or C. Restoration of civil rights under this section
9 is within the meaning of civil rights restored under the federal Firearms Owners' Protection
10 Act, 18 United States Code, Section 921(a)(20).
11 5. Subsequent conviction. If a person who has had the person's civil rights restored
12 under this section is subsequently convicted of any felony crime in this State or in another
13 jurisdiction, the person's right to own, possess and have under that person's control a
14 firearm is revoked, the person is ineligible from qualifying for a restoration of civil rights
15 under this section and the court that issued the order restoring the person's rights under
16 subsection 3 shall revoke the order.
17 SUMMARY
1188 Currently, persons who have been convicted of committing or found not criminally
1199 responsible by reason of insanity of committing a crime in this State, a crime under the
2200 laws of the United States and certain crimes in other jurisdictions that are punishable by a
2211 term of imprisonment of one year or more are prohibited from owning, possessing or
2222 having under their control a firearm. This bill restores the right for some of these convicted
2233 persons to own, possess and have a firearm under their control, setting certain eligibility
2244 requirements a person must meet to have their civil rights relating to firearms restored,
2255 including a requirement that 10 years have passed since the completion of any sentence
2266 imposed on them. Eligibility for restoration of firearm rights is excluded for certain
2277 enumerated categories of crimes, including murder; any Class A crime; any Class B or C
2288 crime in violation of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17-A, chapter 9, 11, 12, 13, 33 or
2299 45; robbery; assault on an officer; assault on an emergency medical services person; assault
3300 on a firefighter; aggravated sex trafficking; and sex trafficking.
31 The bill also outlines the procedure for applying for a restoration of civil rights. A
32 person meeting the eligibility requirements may submit a request to the Department of
33 Public Safety to have that person's firearm rights restored. Upon receipt of a request, the
34 department must conduct a review of the person's criminal history to ensure the person is
35 eligible. Upon a determination that the person is eligible, the department must notify the
36 court having jurisdiction over the crime on which the person's firearm prohibition is based,
37 and that court must issue an order restoring the person's rights.
38 The bill also stipulates that, in the event a person who has had the person's civil rights
39 restored is subsequently convicted of any felony crime, defined as a crime punishable by a
40 sentence of imprisonment of one year or more in Maine or any other jurisdiction, that
41 person's restored rights are revoked and the person is ineligible from qualifying for a
42 restoration of that person's rights in the future. In this occurrence, the court that issued the
43 order restoring the person's civil rights to own, possess and have under the person's control
44 a firearm must revoke that order.
