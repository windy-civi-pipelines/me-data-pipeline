17 SUMMARY
1188 Under current law, if a permittee requests the Commissioner of Environmental
1199 Protection to rescind a site location of development permit for a development that is not a
2200 subdivision, the commissioner must rescind the permit if, among other things, the
2211 development has not been constructed or operated by the permittee. This bill requires the
2222 commissioner to rescind such a permit if the development has been fully decommissioned
2233 to the department's satisfaction. The bill also defines "fully decommissioned."
