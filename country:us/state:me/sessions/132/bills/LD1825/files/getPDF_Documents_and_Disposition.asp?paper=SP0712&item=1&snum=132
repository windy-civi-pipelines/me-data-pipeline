1 SUMMARY
22 This bill is reported out by the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary to implement
33 recommendations of the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services. The committee
44 has not taken a position on the substance of this bill. By reporting this bill out, the
55 committee is not suggesting and does not intend to suggest that it agrees or disagrees with
66 any aspect of this bill; instead, the committee is reporting the bill out for the sole purpose
77 of having a bill printed that can be referred to the committee for an appropriate public
88 hearing and subsequent processing in the normal course. The committee is taking this
99 action to ensure clarity and transparency in the legislative review of the proposals contained
1100 in the bill.
11 Current law requires the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services to send a list
12 of names and contact information for attorneys who provide legal services to persons who
13 are incarcerated to all sheriff's offices and to the Department of Corrections on a weekly
14 basis and provides that each jail or correctional facility has constructive notice of the
15 attorneys' names, telephone numbers and other contact information on the list on the
16 Monday following transmission of the information. Current law further provides that if an
17 oral or wire communication between an incarcerated person and one of the attorneys on the
18 list is intercepted, the contents and existence of the communication are not admissible in a
19 criminal proceeding, including a post-conviction review proceeding, and a person who
20 viewed or listened to the intercepted communication is prohibited from participating in
21 certain criminal investigations involving the defendant and appearing as a witness in certain
22 criminal proceedings against the defendant. The bill amends these provisions of law in
23 the following ways.
24 1. It clarifies that the commission is required to send the names and contact information
25 only of attorneys who provide public defense services to persons who are incarcerated.
26 2. It prohibits a jail, correctional facility or 3rd-party contractor providing
27 communication services to a jail or correctional facility from intercepting oral or wire
28 communications between these attorneys or employees of the attorneys' law offices or from
29 charging a fee for such communications. It also provides that unlawful interception of such
30 communications is a civil violation for which a penalty of $5,000 must be imposed and
31 unlawful charging of a fee for such communications is a civil violation for which a penalty
32 of $500 must be imposed.
33 3. It requires each jail or correctional facility to send an electronic communication to
34 each attorney whose name and contact information is included on the commission's list
35 certifying that communications between the listed telephone number for the attorney and
36 the jail or correctional facility will not be intercepted and that no fee will be charged for
37 those communications and providing the name and contact information of the person at the
38 jail or correctional facility responsible for implementing these requirements. It further
39 provides that failure to send such an electronic communication is a civil violation for which
40 a penalty of $250 must be imposed.
