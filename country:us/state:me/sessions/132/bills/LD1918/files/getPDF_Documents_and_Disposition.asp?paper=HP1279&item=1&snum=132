1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 16 MRSA §703, sub-§2, ¶G, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 267, Pt. A, §2, is
3 amended to read:
4 G. Information disclosing that a criminal charge has been dismissed by a court with
5 prejudice or dismissed with finality by a prosecutor other than as part of a plea
6 agreement in which the defendant pleads guilty to and is convicted of another criminal
7 charge. If a defendant admits to and is adjudicated as having committed a civil
8 violation or a traffic infraction as part of a plea agreement, but does not also plead
9 guilty to and is not also convicted of a criminal charge as part of that agreement,
10 information disclosing that a criminal charge has been dismissed by a court with
11 prejudice or dismissed with finality by a prosecutor as part of that agreement is
12 confidential criminal history record information;
13 Sec. 2. 16 MRSA §705, sub-§5 is enacted to read:
14 5. Charges dismissed as result of deferred disposition. Notwithstanding any
15 provision of this chapter to the contrary and subject to the Maine Rules of Evidence,
16 including rules regarding relevancy, a party may introduce in any civil or criminal
17 proceeding evidence that a defendant pled guilty to a crime as part of a deferred disposition
18 for purposes of establishing that the defendant admitted to committing that crime, even if,
19 after the defendant complied with the court-imposed deferment requirements, the
20 defendant's guilty plea was later withdrawn and the underlying criminal charge was
21 dismissed by the court with prejudice.
22 SUMMARY
2233 This bill is reported out by the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary to implement
2244 statutory changes recommended by the Criminal Records Review Committee, which was
2255 established pursuant to Resolve 2023, chapter 103. The joint standing committee has not
2266 taken a position on the substance of this bill. By reporting this bill out, the joint standing
2277 committee is not suggesting and does not intend to suggest that it agrees or disagrees with
2288 any aspect of this bill; instead, the joint standing committee is reporting the bill out for the
2299 sole purpose of having a bill printed that can be referred to the joint standing committee for
3300 an appropriate public hearing and subsequent processing in the normal course. The joint
3311 standing committee is taking this action to ensure clarity and transparency in the legislative
3322 review of the proposals contained in the bill.
33 The bill clarifies that information disclosing that a criminal charge has been dismissed
34 as part of a plea agreement is not confidential criminal history record information if the
35 defendant pleads guilty to and is convicted of another criminal charge as part of the plea
36 agreement. By contrast, if, as a result of a plea agreement, a defendant admits to and is
37 adjudicated as having committed a civil violation or a traffic infraction but does not also
38 plead guilty to and become convicted of a criminal charge, information disclosing that a
39 criminal charge has been dismissed as part of the plea agreement is confidential criminal
40 history record information.
41 The bill also codifies the rule set forth in Gordon v. Cheskin, 2013 ME 113, that "the
42 dismissal of [a criminal] charge after completion of [a] deferred disposition does not cast a
43 blanket of confidentiality over the course of the proceedings up to that point." Instead, "a
Page 1 - 132LR2464(01)
414 court in a later proceeding is not precluded from considering the defendant's admission of
425 guilt in open court. An admission to specific behavior may be considered in a later
436 proceeding, if that behavior is relevant to the matter before the court."
