An Act to Improve Accountability and Understanding of Data in Insurance
Transactions
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
Sec. 1. 24-A MRSA §1914 is enacted to read:
§1914. Plan sponsor access to claims data; right to audit
1. High-cost claims data. Upon request of a plan sponsor that has certified its
compliance with the use and disclosure requirements of 45 Code of Federal Regulations,
Section 164.504(f), an administrator shall provide data on a high-cost claim so that a plan
sponsor may perform an audit to ensure compliance with the plan sponsor's contract prior
to payment of the high-cost claim. The data must include any itemized billing statements
and medical records associated with the claim in the possession of the administrator or the
administrator's agents. The plan sponsor or the plan sponsor's designee shall make a request
for data on a high-cost claim within 2 business days of receipt of the claim and the
administrator must provide the requested information within 30 business days of the
request. For the purposes of this subsection, "high-cost claim" means any claim related to
an individual provided health coverage by a plan sponsor that exceeds $100,000.
2. Claims data; right to audit. An administrator that contracts with a plan sponsor
to provide health coverage shall permit a plan sponsor to perform a post-payment audit of
all claims paid to ensure compliance with the contract at least once in a calendar year as
long as the request is not earlier than 6 months following a previously requested audit.
Upon request of a plan sponsor as part of an audit, an administrator shall disclose within
30 business days to a plan sponsor that has certified its compliance with the use and
disclosure requirements of 45 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 164.504(f) or, to the
extent permitted by law and if requested by the plan sponsor, to the plan sponsor's
designated business associate the following information specific to the plan sponsor:
A. Claims data received by the administrator via electronic claims transactions on any
current standardized claim form approved by the Federal Government for professional
services or institutional services. The form or transaction may be modified only as
necessary to comply with the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act of 1996, Public Law 104-191;
Page 1 - 132LR0896(03)

B. Claims payments, electronic funds transfers or remittance advice notices provided
by the administrator as electronic files compliant with the federal Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Public Law 104-191, including, but not
limited to, electronic claims transactions for both the billed amount and the paid
amount for professional services and both the billed amount and the paid amount for
institutional services. The files may be modified only as necessary to comply with the
federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Public Law
104-191, and the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical
Health Act of 2009, Title XIII, Subtitle D, Public Law 111-5, and any regulations
promulgated under those laws;
C. Any fees charged to the plan sponsor related to plan administration and claims
processing, including renegotiation fees, access fees, repricing fees or enhanced review
fees; and
D. Any out-of-network fees or out-of-network negotiated discounts, aligned incentive
program fees, pay-for-performance payments and recoveries, cost-containment
program fees, overpayment recovery program fees, subrogation fees and any other
special program fees and discounts.
3. No conditions or fees on audit. An administrator may not impose on a plan
sponsor:
A. Any fees relating to an audit request under this section that exceed the direct
expenses properly and actually incurred by the administrator to provide the data; or
B. Any conditions that would restrict a plan sponsor's right to conduct an audit under
this section, including, but not limited to, restrictions on:
(1) The time period covered by the audit, except that a request pursuant to this
section must be made within 24 months of the end of each plan year to be audited;
(2) The number of claims analyzed;
(3) The type of analysis conducted;
(4) The data elements used in the analysis;
(5) The means by which an auditor is compensated by a plan sponsor; or
(6) The plan sponsor's choice of auditor as long as the plan sponsor certifies that
the auditor has adequate conflict of interest protection provisions to prevent
conflicts of interest from adversely affecting the outcome of the audit.
4. Nondisclosure and data use agreement. An administrator may require that the plan
sponsor and the plan sponsor's designated business associate execute a nondisclosure and
data use agreement that reasonably restricts the auditor's use of data provided by the
administrator to the sole purpose of conducting an audit on behalf of a plan sponsor. The
coverage limits of any cybersecurity insurance or liability insurance policy required under
the nondisclosure and data use agreement may not exceed the administrator's limit of
liability under the services agreement between the plan sponsor and the administrator, if
such limit applies. In addition, an administrator is not required to provide data to an auditor
selected by a plan sponsor if the auditor has previously breached a nondisclosure and data
use agreement with that administrator or refuses to execute a nondisclosure and data use
agreement.

104-191, and the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health
Act of 2009, Title XIII, Subtitle D, Public Law 111-5, and any regulations promulgated
under those laws.
6. Application. An administrator may not enter into, issue, amend or renew any
contract or network services agreement with a plan sponsor on or after January 1, 2026 that
contains any provision that violates this section.

section is subject to exclusive enforcement under the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act,
including any of the remedies provided for in the Act. A violation is committed each time
a prohibited act under this section occurs. Investigations of violations by administrators
may include a 3rd party that may possess evidence supporting such investigation.
