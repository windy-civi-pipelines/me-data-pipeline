1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, this legislation allows a municipality to authorize the use of a siren in a
4 motor vehicle operated by a harbor master or deputy harbor master when responding to an
5 emergency call; and
6 Whereas, it is imperative that this legislation take effect before the start of the boating
7 season; and
8 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
9 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
10 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
11 therefore,
12 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
13 Sec. 1. 29-A MRSA §2054, sub-§2, ¶F, as amended by PL 2023, c. 131, §1, is
14 further amended by amending subparagraph (5) to read:
15 (5) A municipality may authorize a harbor master or deputy harbor master
16 appointed under Title 38, section 1 or 2, respectively, to use one red or combination
17 red and white flashing auxiliary light mounted in the windshield or on the
18 dashboard at the front of a vehicle or 2 flashing red or combination red and white
19 auxiliary lights mounted on the front of the vehicle above the front bumper and
20 below the hood and one red auxiliary light mounted in the rear window area. The
21 light or lights may be displayed but may be used only while the harbor master or
22 deputy harbor master is responding to a watercraft emergency. A light mounted
23 on the dashboard or in the windshield must be shielded so that the emitted light
24 does not interfere with the operator's vision. Notwithstanding subsection 3, a
25 municipality may also authorize the use of a siren in a motor vehicle operated by
26 the harbor master or deputy harbor master when responding to a watercraft
27 emergency. The authorization for the use of lights or a siren may be revoked at any
28 time by the municipality.
29 Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation
30 takes effect when approved.
