1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 36 MRSA §5231, sub-§4 is enacted to read:
3 4. Material budgetary impact. The assessor may not grant a generally applicable
4 extension of time for payment or filing that would have a material budgetary impact on the
5 State without the approval of the Commissioner of Administrative and Financial Services.
6 Prior to granting the approval, the commissioner shall report in writing to the Governor the
7 nature of the extension and its budgetary impact and shall send a copy of the report to the
8 President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the majority and
9 minority leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives, the chair of the joint standing
10 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over taxation matters and the chair of the
11 joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over appropriations and
12 financial affairs.
13 Sec. 2. 36 MRSA §5295 is enacted to read:
14 §5295. Temporary adjustments to Maine income tax filing requirements based on
15 federal changes
16 1. Federal income tax law changes; report. Whenever it appears to the
17 Commissioner of Administrative and Financial Services that the Legislature has not had
18 the opportunity before the bureau begins processing returns for the most recently completed
19 tax year to conform or adjust Maine laws in response to federal income tax law changes
20 affecting the tax year, the commissioner shall report in writing to the Governor a
21 description of the federal income tax law changes and their potential effect on Maine
22 income tax laws and the state budget. The commissioner shall timely send a copy of the
23 report to the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the
24 majority and minority leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives, the chair of the
25 joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over taxation matters and

27 appropriations and financial affairs.
28 2. Determination by Governor of temporary adjustment of Maine income tax
29 filing requirements. After receiving the report pursuant to subsection 1, the Governor
30 may direct the assessor to temporarily adjust, in a manner determined equitable by the
31 Governor, the assessor's administration of the tax year based on some or all of the federal
32 income tax law changes as the Governor may equitably determine, contingent on the future
33 enactment by the Legislature of legislation that addresses the federal income tax law
34 changes. The Governor, to the extent practicable, shall make the determination consistent
35 with the intent of the Legislature in enacted Maine income tax laws and consider the
36 budgetary implications of the determination and the extent to which the determination
37 reduces the complexity of the affected tax year to ease taxpayers' compliance with, and the
38 bureau's administration of, Maine income tax laws.
39 3. Notice. Immediately upon making a determination pursuant to subsection 2, the
40 Governor shall notify the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of
41 Representatives, the majority and minority leaders of the Senate and House of
42 Representatives, the chair of the joint standing committee of the Legislature having
43 jurisdiction over taxation matters and the chair of the joint standing committee of the
44 Legislature having jurisdiction over appropriations and financial affairs of the specific
Page 1 - 132LR0236(01)
415 direction provided to the assessor and the effect of that determination on Maine income tax
426 laws and the state budget.
3 4. Action by assessor. Upon receiving the direction of the Governor pursuant to
4 subsection 2, the assessor shall proceed in accordance with that direction, including in the
5 processing of income tax returns and notices, the acceptance of tax payments and the
6 issuance of refunds.
7 The tax return filing instructions or related public information must:
8 A. State that the tax return filing instructions and processing of those returns are, in
9 whole or in part, contingent on the enactment by the Legislature of legislation that
10 addresses federal income tax law changes;
11 B. Explain that a taxpayer may choose to wait for the enactment by the Legislature of
12 legislation that addresses federal income tax law changes by filing under extension
13 pursuant to section 5231, subsection 4;
14 C. Require a taxpayer that files a tax return to do so in a manner consistent with the
15 issued tax returns, forms, instructions and other guidance; and
16 D. State that if the Legislature enacts legislation that addresses federal income tax law
17 changes that are at variance with the filing instructions in effect at the time of filing:
18 (1) The affected taxpayer is not subject to interest or penalty for a resulting
19 underpayment related to the variance;
20 (2) Any incorrect refund will not result in interest or penalty accruing prior to the
21 date of enactment of such legislation; and
22 (3) The affected taxpayer shall file an amended return to address the variance.
