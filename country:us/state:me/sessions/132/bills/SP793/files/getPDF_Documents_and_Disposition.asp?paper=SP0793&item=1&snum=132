WHEREAS, the 2nd week of May is National Hospital Week, a time to celebrate and
recognize the dedication and hard work of doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals across
the State who selflessly care for patients and enhance the health and well-being of the
community; and
WHEREAS, Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center is a vital tertiary care hospital
serving the northern 2/3 of the State and providing comprehensive medical services to the

cardiovascular care for over 40 years, offering advanced medical treatment and technologies
to ensure the heart health of the people of Maine. Their team of highly skilled cardiovascular
physicians and dedicated healthcare professionals has been at the forefront of providing
innovative heart care solutions, using state-of-the-art equipment and procedures to deliver the
best possible outcomes for patients; and

Dr. Darryl Hoffman, a distinguished surgeon in the field of cardiothoracic surgery, is
committed to the highest standards of care, saving lives and making a lasting difference in the
lives of countless patients throughout the region; now, therefore, be it
RESOLVED: that We, the Members of the One Hundred and Thirty-second Legislature
now assembled in the First Special Session, on behalf of the people we represent, take this
