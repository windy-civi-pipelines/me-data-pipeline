license.
2. Exemption. An architect who receives an initial license to practice architecture
from any jurisdiction, including a foreign jurisdiction, is exempt from the requirements of
subsection 1 for 2 years from the date of issuance of that initial license, as long as the
architect has not been previously licensed by any jurisdiction, including a foreign
jurisdiction, for a period of 2 or more years.
3. Program approval. Each application for approval of a continuing education
course, program or activity must be submitted to the board annually according to the rules
