1 SUMMARY
22 This bill requires that certain categories of hearings and other judicial proceedings in
33 the District Court, Superior Court and Supreme Judicial Court be conducted by electronic
44 means absent a finding that conducting the proceeding by electronic means is inappropriate
55 because it would result in a deprivation of due process, fairness or justice. This requirement
66 does not apply to criminal trials or to civil jury trials requiring the presentation of evidence
77 absent the approval of the court and consent of each party to the proceeding. The bill also
88 requires the court to provide reasonable accommodations to individuals with limited access
99 to the technology required to participate by electronic means as well as individuals with
1100 disabilities that limit the individuals' ability to fully participate by electronic means.
11 The bill recognizes the authority of the Supreme Judicial Court to adopt rules and issue
12 orders to implement the provisions of this legislation. It further directs the Supreme
13 Judicial Court to submit an annual report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature
14 having jurisdiction over judiciary matters regarding the conduct of hearings and other
15 judicial proceedings by electronic means in state courts. The bill also requires the Supreme
16 Judicial Court to submit a report by December 3, 2025 to the Joint Standing Committee on
17 Judiciary detailing the provisions rendered of no effect due to the bill's provisions.
