28 SUMMARY
2299 This bill amends the provisions of law governing the Maine Space Corporation, which
3300 in current law is a body corporate and politic with the powers and duties of a corporation
3311 under the Maine Business Corporation Act. The bill amends these provisions by
3322 designating the Maine Space Corporation a nonprofit corporation with public and
3333 charitable purposes and the powers and duties of a nonprofit corporation under state law.
3344 The bill specifies that the duties, activities and operations of the corporation must align
3355 with the requirements of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, Section
3366 501(c)(3). The bill clarifies that the Maine Space Corporation is a quasi-independent state
3377 entity and when exercising the powers conferred to it under state law, the corporation is
3388 deemed to act as an instrumentality of the State conducting an essential governmental
3399 function.
40 The bill requires that the corporation's organizing document contain a provision that
41 requires, upon dissolution of the corporation, that funds, assets and other property of the
Page 2 - 132LR0092(01)
412 corporation be used for an exempt purpose under the United States Internal Revenue Code
423 of 1986, Section 501(c)(3) or transferred to the State for a public purpose. The bill
434 establishes a provision that allows certain records of the corporation containing trade
445 secrets or proprietary information to be exempt from public records requirements and to be
456 held confidential.
6 The bill also clarifies that as long as the quorum and voting requirements are met, a
7 vote of the board is not invalidated due to a vacancy on the board.
