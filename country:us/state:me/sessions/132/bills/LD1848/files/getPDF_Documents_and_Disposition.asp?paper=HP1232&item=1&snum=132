39 recommendations regarding terms or conditions necessary to minimize the risk of dam
40 failure and to protect public safety and property downstream from the dam that may result
41 from the failure or operation of the dam.
42 For maintenance and repair activities on an existing dam for which a permit is not
43 required under that Act, the bill provides that a long-term maintenance and repair plan for
44 the dam, which is required to be submitted to the Department of Environmental Protection
Page 5 - 132LR2004(01)

415 prior to the commencement of any maintenance or repair activities, must also be submitted
426 to the Maine Emergency Management Agency.
3 2. It modifies the duties of the Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency
4 Management under the State's dam safety program under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title
5 37-B, chapter 24, by providing for coordination with the Department of Environmental
6 Protection in its administration of the program, clarifying the policies and procedures to be
7 adopted for the administration and enforcement of the program, requiring the development
8 and implementation of a comprehensive database management system, specifying staffing
9 responsibilities, providing for stakeholder engagement and imposing an annual legislative
10 reporting requirement.
11 3. It clarifies that, for the purposes of the dam safety program under Title 37-B, chapter
12 24, a state dam inspector appointed or hired by the Commissioner of Defense, Veterans and
13 Emergency Management is the legal representative of the commissioner.
14 4. It requires the Commissioner of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management to
15 evaluate the downstream hazard potential of each dam to determine the potential risk to

19 adopt by rule policies and guidelines for owners of dams assigned a high hazard potential
20 to conduct potential failure mode analyses of dams, based on the potential failure mode
21 process developed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
22 6. It requires inspection by a state dam inspector of all significant hazard potential
23 dams and all high hazard potential dams at least once every 5 years.
24 7. It authorizes the Commissioner of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management
25 to adopt major substantive rules establishing a schedule for the required payment of
26 monetary penalties by a dam owner, lessee or other person in control of a dam that fails to
