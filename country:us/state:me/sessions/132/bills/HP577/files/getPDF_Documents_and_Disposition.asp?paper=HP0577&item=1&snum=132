JOINT RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING FEBRUARY 2025 AS
CHILDREN'S DENTAL HEALTH MONTH
WHEREAS, dental caries is the most common chronic disease found in children; and
WHEREAS, through dental education and regular preventive dental care, tooth decay is
almost completely preventable; and
WHEREAS, good oral health habits start in childhood, and parents and caregivers who
are educated about the importance of oral health are empowered to embrace appropriate oral
hygiene and dietary behaviors and make and keep dental appointments for their children; and
WHEREAS, research shows that, through supervised tooth brushing programs and
preventive dental care, children can reduce the occurrence of dental-related illness, which starts
as early as first grade and causes children in the United States to miss 51,000,000 hours of
school time each year; and
WHEREAS, through a balanced diet, brushing and flossing after every meal and regular
dental checkups, children can avoid dental caries and remain healthy; now, therefore, be it
RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Thirty-second Legislature
now assembled in the First Regular Session, on behalf of the people we represent, take this
opportunity to designate February 2025 as Children's Dental Health Month and to encourage
the raising of public awareness about the importance of preventive dental care for all children.
