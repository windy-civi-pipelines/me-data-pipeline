14 SUMMARY
1155 This bill does the following.
16 1. It amends the law governing the kilowatt-hour credit net energy billing program to
17 provide that, unless a distributed generation resource has met the timing requirements
18 established for participation in the program, only distributed generation resources with a
19 nameplate capacity of 20 kilowatts or less may be used for net energy billing. For
20 distributed generation resources participating pursuant to this provision, the number of
21 shared financial interest customers or meters is limited to 10 and a customer may not, at
22 one time, have a financial interest in more than 5 distributed generation resources that have
23 net energy billing arrangements. The bill also provides that kilowatt-hour credits may be
24 credited only to a customer's electricity supply charges.
25 2. It amends the law governing the tariff rate net energy billing program to limit the
26 tariff rate to the supply rate of the standard-offer service rate.
27 3. It amends the laws governing the tariff rate and kilowatt-hour credit net energy
28 billing programs to prohibit participation 20 years from the date a net energy billing
29 agreement between the entity proposing the development of the distributed generation
30 resource and the transmission and distribution utility was executed or on December 31,
31 2045, whichever occurs earlier. The bill also requires a distributed generation resource
32 participating in net energy billing programs to sell in the State renewable energy credits
33 generated by the resource.
