33 SUMMARY
3344 This bill amends the law governing the licensing of eating establishments, lodging
3355 places, recreational camps, youth camps, public pools, public spas and campgrounds by
3366 creating an exception that allows a license to be transferred when a licensee has died. Under
3377 the bill, the personal representative of the deceased licensee, or another authorized person,
3388 may take over the license for one year after the date of the personal representative's or
3399 another authorized person's appointment.
40 The bill enacts a provision that makes confidential the identity of a person making a
41 complaint concerning actions taken by the Department of Health and Human Services
42 associated with the department's licensing or regulatory authority over several categories
43 of professions and establishments.

1 The bill clarifies that for licenses issued for electrology, tattooing, micropigmentation
2 and body piercing, any license issued in error is void and must be returned to the department
3 on demand.
4 With respect to licensing for micropigmentation, the bill removes language that
5 establishes a specific calendar date for the biennial expiration of licenses and clarifies that
6 the term of a license is 2 years beginning on the date it is issued.
7 The bill also removes duplicative language in the provisions governing licensing for
8 micropigmentation and body piercings concerning the use of licensing fees to cover the
9 cost of the department's inspection.
