424 fulfillment providers and common carriers. The bill establishes shipment restrictions and
435 limitations for direct shippers of spirits and procedures for establishing spirits pricing and
446 for payments to the bureau for spirits shipped directly to recipients in the State, rather than
457 going through the State's warehouse. The bill also establishes an effective date of July 1,

3366 This bill allows distilleries, small distilleries, rectifiers and out-of-state spirits
3377 manufacturers to ship their spirits to recipients in the State in a manner similar to that
3388 presently allowed for wineries to ship their wine products. The bill authorizes a direct
3399 shipper of spirits to use a fulfillment provider for the direct shipment of spirits. The bill
4400 provides that fulfillment providers must be registered with the Department of
4411 Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery
4422 Operations in order to ship spirits on behalf of a direct shipper to recipients in this State.

424 fulfillment providers and common carriers. The bill establishes shipment restrictions and
435 limitations for direct shippers of spirits and procedures for establishing spirits pricing and
446 for payments to the bureau for spirits shipped directly to recipients in the State, rather than
457 going through the State's warehouse. The bill also establishes an effective date of July 1,
468 2026.
