27 ยง580-J. Liability of responsible parties
28 1. Responsible party liability. A responsible party is strictly liable for a share of the
29 costs of climate change adaptation projects and all qualifying expenditures from the fund.
30 For purposes of this section, entities in a controlled group:
31 A. Must be treated by the department as a single entity for the purposes of identifying
32 responsible parties; and
33 B. Are jointly and severally liable for payment of any cost recovery demand owed by
34 any entity in the controlled group.
35 2. Cost recovery demand. With respect to each responsible party, the cost recovery
36 demand is equal to an amount that bears the same ratio to the cost to the State and its
37 residents, as calculated by the Treasurer of State, from the emission of covered greenhouse
38 gases during the covered period as the responsible party's applicable share of covered
39 greenhouse gas emissions bears to the aggregate applicable shares of covered greenhouse
40 gas emissions resulting from the use of fossil fuels extracted or refined during the covered
41 period.
Page 3 - 132LR2359(01)
1 3. Minority interest. If a responsible party owns a minority interest of 10% or more
2 in another entity, the responsible party's applicable share of covered greenhouse gas
3 emissions is increased by the applicable share of covered greenhouse gas emissions for the
4 entity in which the responsible party holds a minority interest multiplied by the percentage
5 of the minority interest held by the responsible party.
6 4. Greenhouse gas emissions. The department shall use the best available
7 information, including but not limited to the United States Environmental Protection
8 Agency's emissions factors for greenhouse gas inventories as applied to the fossil fuel
9 volume data, for the purpose of determining the amount of covered greenhouse gas
10 emissions attributable to any entity from the fossil fuels attributable to the entity.
11 5. Adjustments. The department may adjust the cost recovery demand amount of a
12 responsible party who refined petroleum products or who is a successor in interest to an
13 entity that refines petroleum products if the responsible party establishes to the satisfaction
14 of the department that:
15 A. A portion of the cost recovery demand amount was attributable to the refining of
16 crude oil extracted by another responsible party; and
17 B. The crude oil extracted by the other entity was accounted for when the department
18 determined the cost recovery demand amount for the other entity or a successor in
19 interest to the other entity.
20 6. Payments; installments. A responsible party shall pay the cost recovery demand
21 amount in full not later than 6 months following the department's issuance of the cost
22 recovery demand, except that a responsible party may elect to pay the cost recovery demand
23 amount in 9 annual installments in accordance with this subsection.
24 The first installment must be paid not later than 6 months following the department's
25 issuance of the cost recovery demand and is equal to 20% of the total cost recovery demand
26 amount. Each subsequent installment must be paid not later than one year from the initial
27 payment and each subsequent year and must be equal to 10% of the total cost recovery
28 demand amount. The commissioner may charge reasonable interest on each installment
29 payment or a delayed payment and, at the commissioner's discretion, may adjust the amount
30 of a subsequent installment payment or a delayed payment to reflect increases or decreases
31 in the Consumer Price Index. The unpaid balance of all remaining installments becomes
32 due immediately if:
33 A. The responsible party fails to pay any installment in a timely manner, as specified
34 in department rules;
35 B. There is a liquidation or sale of substantially all the assets of the responsible party,
36 except that, in the case of a sale of substantially all the assets of a responsible party,
37 the remaining installments do not become due immediately if the buyer enters into an
38 agreement with the department under which the buyer assumes liability for the
39 remaining installments due under this subsection in the same manner as if the buyer
40 were the responsible party; or
41 C. The responsible party ceases to do business.
42 7. Fund deposits. The department shall deposit cost recovery payments collected
43 under this chapter into the fund.
Page 4 - 132LR2359(01)
1 8. Reconsideration. A responsible party aggrieved by the issuance of a notice of cost
2 recovery demand may file a request for reconsideration with the department within 30 days
3 following issuance of the notice of cost recovery demand. A request for reconsideration
4 must state the grounds for the request and include supporting documentation. The
5 department shall notify the responsible party of the final decision by issuing a subsequent
6 notice of cost recovery demand. A responsible party aggrieved by the issuance of a final
7 notice of cost recovery demand under this subsection may bring an action in the Superior
8 Court of Kennebec County seeking an order annulling, altering or modifying the notice of
9 cost recovery demand.
10 9. Construction. This Act may not be construed to relieve any person from liability
11 at common law or under any state law. This Act may not be construed to preempt, displace,
12 restrict or limit in any way any other claim or remedy available to a person.

3377 interest to an entity that was engaged in the trade or business of extracting fossil fuel or
3388 refining crude oil between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2024 is assessed a cost
3399 recovery demand for the entity's share of fossil fuel extraction or refinement contributing
4400 to greenhouse gas-related costs in the State. An entity is assessed a cost recovery demand
4411 only if the department determines that the entity's products were responsible for more than
4422 one billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. Cost recovery payments received by
Page 7 - 132LR2359(01)
413 the department are deposited into the Climate Superfund Cost Recovery Program Fund to

12 ยง580-I. Climate Superfund Cost Recovery Program
13 The Climate Superfund Cost Recovery Program is established within and administered
14 by the department. The purposes of the program are:
15 1. Compensatory payments. To secure compensatory payments from responsible
16 parties based on a standard of strict liability to provide a source of revenue for climate
17 change adaptation projects within the State;
18 2. Proportional liabilities. To determine proportional liability of responsible parties;
19 3. Cost recovery demands. To impose cost recovery demands on responsible parties
20 and issue notices of cost recovery demands;
21 4. Responsible party payments. To accept and collect payment from responsible
22 parties;
23 5. Strategy. To develop, adopt, implement and update the strategy in order to identify
24 and prioritize climate change adaptation projects; and
25 6. Funds dispersal. To disperse funds to climate change adaptation projects identified
26 in the strategy.
27 ยง580-J. Liability of responsible parties
28 1. Responsible party liability. A responsible party is strictly liable for a share of the
29 costs of climate change adaptation projects and all qualifying expenditures from the fund.
30 For purposes of this section, entities in a controlled group:
31 A. Must be treated by the department as a single entity for the purposes of identifying
32 responsible parties; and
33 B. Are jointly and severally liable for payment of any cost recovery demand owed by
34 any entity in the controlled group.
35 2. Cost recovery demand. With respect to each responsible party, the cost recovery
36 demand is equal to an amount that bears the same ratio to the cost to the State and its
37 residents, as calculated by the Treasurer of State, from the emission of covered greenhouse
38 gases during the covered period as the responsible party's applicable share of covered
39 greenhouse gas emissions bears to the aggregate applicable shares of covered greenhouse
40 gas emissions resulting from the use of fossil fuels extracted or refined during the covered
41 period.
Page 3 - 132LR2359(01)

1 3. Minority interest. If a responsible party owns a minority interest of 10% or more
2 in another entity, the responsible party's applicable share of covered greenhouse gas
3 emissions is increased by the applicable share of covered greenhouse gas emissions for the
4 entity in which the responsible party holds a minority interest multiplied by the percentage
5 of the minority interest held by the responsible party.
6 4. Greenhouse gas emissions. The department shall use the best available
7 information, including but not limited to the United States Environmental Protection
8 Agency's emissions factors for greenhouse gas inventories as applied to the fossil fuel
9 volume data, for the purpose of determining the amount of covered greenhouse gas
10 emissions attributable to any entity from the fossil fuels attributable to the entity.
11 5. Adjustments. The department may adjust the cost recovery demand amount of a
12 responsible party who refined petroleum products or who is a successor in interest to an
13 entity that refines petroleum products if the responsible party establishes to the satisfaction
14 of the department that:
15 A. A portion of the cost recovery demand amount was attributable to the refining of
16 crude oil extracted by another responsible party; and
17 B. The crude oil extracted by the other entity was accounted for when the department
18 determined the cost recovery demand amount for the other entity or a successor in
19 interest to the other entity.
20 6. Payments; installments. A responsible party shall pay the cost recovery demand
21 amount in full not later than 6 months following the department's issuance of the cost
22 recovery demand, except that a responsible party may elect to pay the cost recovery demand
23 amount in 9 annual installments in accordance with this subsection.
24 The first installment must be paid not later than 6 months following the department's
25 issuance of the cost recovery demand and is equal to 20% of the total cost recovery demand
26 amount. Each subsequent installment must be paid not later than one year from the initial
27 payment and each subsequent year and must be equal to 10% of the total cost recovery
28 demand amount. The commissioner may charge reasonable interest on each installment
29 payment or a delayed payment and, at the commissioner's discretion, may adjust the amount
30 of a subsequent installment payment or a delayed payment to reflect increases or decreases
31 in the Consumer Price Index. The unpaid balance of all remaining installments becomes
32 due immediately if:
33 A. The responsible party fails to pay any installment in a timely manner, as specified
34 in department rules;
35 B. There is a liquidation or sale of substantially all the assets of the responsible party,
36 except that, in the case of a sale of substantially all the assets of a responsible party,
37 the remaining installments do not become due immediately if the buyer enters into an
38 agreement with the department under which the buyer assumes liability for the
39 remaining installments due under this subsection in the same manner as if the buyer
40 were the responsible party; or
41 C. The responsible party ceases to do business.
42 7. Fund deposits. The department shall deposit cost recovery payments collected
43 under this chapter into the fund.
Page 4 - 132LR2359(01)

1 8. Reconsideration. A responsible party aggrieved by the issuance of a notice of cost
2 recovery demand may file a request for reconsideration with the department within 30 days
3 following issuance of the notice of cost recovery demand. A request for reconsideration
4 must state the grounds for the request and include supporting documentation. The
5 department shall notify the responsible party of the final decision by issuing a subsequent
6 notice of cost recovery demand. A responsible party aggrieved by the issuance of a final
7 notice of cost recovery demand under this subsection may bring an action in the Superior
8 Court of Kennebec County seeking an order annulling, altering or modifying the notice of
9 cost recovery demand.
10 9. Construction. This Act may not be construed to relieve any person from liability
11 at common law or under any state law. This Act may not be construed to preempt, displace,
12 restrict or limit in any way any other claim or remedy available to a person.
13 ยง580-K. Climate Superfund Cost Recovery Program Fund

34 SUMMARY
3355 This bill establishes the Climate Superfund Cost Recovery Program within the
3366 Department of Environmental Protection. Under the program, an entity or a successor in
3377 interest to an entity that was engaged in the trade or business of extracting fossil fuel or
3388 refining crude oil between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2024 is assessed a cost
3399 recovery demand for the entity's share of fossil fuel extraction or refinement contributing
4400 to greenhouse gas-related costs in the State. An entity is assessed a cost recovery demand
4411 only if the department determines that the entity's products were responsible for more than
4422 one billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. Cost recovery payments received by
Page 7 - 132LR2359(01)
