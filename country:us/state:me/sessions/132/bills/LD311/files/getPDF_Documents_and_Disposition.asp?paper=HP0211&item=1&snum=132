3 Whereas, Maine's meat and poultry inspection program exists to protect the health

1 SUMMARY
22 This bill requires the Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to
33 designate state inspectors authorized to perform inspection functions under the laws
44 governing meat and poultry inspections essential to the operations of establishments at
55 which inspection of the slaughter of livestock or poultry or the preparation of livestock
66 products or poultry products occurs.
7 The bill also directs the commissioner to require, rather than authorize as in current
8 law, inspection to continue at such an establishment on state holidays or beyond the regular
9 work shift or workweek for state inspectors as long as the necessary inspectors are available
10 and the establishment pays all overtime salaries for inspections necessary to keep the plant
11 open and other expenses caused by the overtime employment.
