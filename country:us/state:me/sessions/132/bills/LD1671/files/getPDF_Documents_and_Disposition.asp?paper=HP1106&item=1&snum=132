24 SUMMARY
2255 This bill requires that a law enforcement agency disclose to a prosecuting attorney's
2266 office when a law enforcement officer who is a potential witness in a criminal prosecution
2277 has engaged in certain specified conduct that calls into question the credibility of the officer
2288 as a witness, including, but not limited to, knowingly making untruthful statements of
2299 material facts, tampering with evidence, other dishonest acts or admissions of dishonesty,
3300 demonstrated patterns of bias against protected classes and facts reflecting an officer's
3311 impaired ability to perceive or recall the truth of a matter. Law enforcement agencies must
3322 notify the law enforcement officer when disclosing the credibility information to a
3333 prosecuting attorney's office.
34 The prosecuting attorney's office must provide notice to the law enforcement officer
35 and the chief law enforcement officer of the reporting law enforcement agency at least 10
36 calendar days before disclosure of the information to a defendant, except under specific
37 circumstances, and provide the law enforcement officer an opportunity to address a
38 potential disclosure to a defendant before any such disclosure is made.
39 The bill requires a law enforcement agency to adopt written policies and procedures
40 for disclosing credibility information to a prosecuting attorney's office. It requires the
41 prosecuting attorney's office to adopt written policies and procedures for receiving and
42 maintaining credibility records concerning law enforcement officers, disclosing credibility

413 information to a defendant under the Maine Rules of Unified Criminal Procedure, Rule 16,
424 notifying other prosecuting attorney's offices in the State of the credibility information and
435 removing such records if the information is later determined to be inaccurate or false.
4 The bill allows an officer to file a petition in Superior Court to require a prosecuting
5 attorney's office to remove the credibility information from the officer's records of that
6 officer if the credibility information is found to be false or inaccurate.
