3 amended to read:
4 2. Has registered for work. The individual has registered for work at, and continued
5 to report at, an employment office in accordance with rules the commissioner adopts,
6 except that the commissioner may, by rule, waive or alter either or both of the requirements
7 of this subsection as to individuals attached to regular jobs and as to such other types of
8 cases or situations with respect to which the commissioner finds that compliance with the

10 chapter. A rule under this subsection may not conflict with section 1191, subsection 1.
11 The individual must actively seek work 3 times each week in which a claim for benefits is

13 search has been waived in accordance with rules adopted by the commissioner and provide
14 evidence of work search efforts in a manner and form as prescribed by the Department of
15 Labor. Failure to provide required work search documentation results in a denial of
16 benefits in accordance with section 1194, subsection 2 for the week or weeks for which no
17 documentation was provided unless the department determines there is good cause for the
18 individual's failure to comply with this requirement;.

433 search efforts were completed. Such a form must require the claimant to report the
444 following:
5 (1) The effort taken to fulfill each of the 3 weekly work search requirements;
6 (2) The employer, employment office, program or agency with which the claimant
7 interacted or educational program in which the claimant participated;

14 10% of all work search effort reports for random audits with employers, employment
15 offices or educational programs of reported work search efforts;
16 Sec. 2. 26 MRSA §1192, sub-§13, as amended by PL 2023, c. 233, §1, is further

18 13. Reemployment services and eligibility assessment; participation. In the case
19 that the individual has been referred to reemployment services and eligibility assessment
20 by the Department of Labor, the individual participates in those services, unless the
21 department determines there is good cause for the individual's failure to participate. Failure
22 to participate in reemployment services and eligibility assessment without good cause
23 results in a denial of benefits until the individual participates; and
24 Sec. 3. 26 MRSA §1192, sub-§14, as amended by PL 2023, c. 233, §2, is repealed.
25 SUMMARY
2266 This bill updates the eligibility conditions for unemployment compensation to require
2277 an individual to actively seek work 3 times each week to be considered eligible and
2288 removes the provision exempting an individual from this requirement by receiving a waiver
2299 by the Commissioner of Labor. The bill establishes acceptable work search efforts for the
3300 purpose of fulfilling the requirements to receive unemployment compensation, establishes
3311 submission requirements for the evidence of a work search to be submitted to the
3322 Department of Labor and establishes verification and audit requirements for the
3333 department. The bill also removes the provision allowing an individual to receive
3344 unemployment compensation while temporarily unemployed.
