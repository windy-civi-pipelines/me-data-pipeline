1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 36 MRSA §701-B is enacted to read:
3 §701-B. Alternate assessment
4 Notwithstanding section 701-A and consistent with the Constitution of Maine, Article
5 IX, Section 8, an alternative rate of assessment may be established as provided in this
6 section.
7 1. Different rates of tax for different categories of assessed real property. An
8 assessor, in determining just value, may apply a different tax rate to each of the following
9 categories of assessed real property:
10 A. Land; and
11 B. Buildings and other improvements.
12 In establishing the different rates allowed by this subsection, an assessor may use for
13 guidance the provisions of section 701-A.
14 2. Equal application of rates. The rates imposed on each category of assessed real
15 property specified in subsection 1 must be applied equally within each primary assessing
16 area, as defined in section 306, subsection 4.
17 3. Use of other tax benefit programs. This section may not be construed to prohibit
18 the use of any other tax benefit program established in law that would otherwise be
19 available to the owner of the real property.
20 Sec. 2. Application. This Act applies to property tax years beginning on or after
21 April 1, 2026.
22 SUMMARY
2233 Under current law, an assessor determines for purposes of taxation the valuation of real
2244 property as a whole, including the land and any improvements on the land. This bill
2255 provides for an alternate method of assessment of real property by allowing an assessor to
2266 impose a different rate of taxation on land and any improvements to that land. The rates
2277 must be imposed equally throughout the assessed area.
