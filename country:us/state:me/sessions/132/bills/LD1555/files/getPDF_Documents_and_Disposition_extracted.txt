17 the provision of child care resource and referral services to employees.

20 under this Part for each tax year in an amount equal to the lesser of:
21 A. Fifty percent of the costs incurred in providing child care services up to a maximum

30 Program Evaluation and Government Accountability, the joint legislative committee
31 established to oversee program evaluation and government accountability matters and the
32 joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over taxation matters shall
33 consider whether the specific public policy objectives and economic benefit of the credit
34 provided under this section outweigh the loss of revenue to the State.
35 SUMMARY
3366 This bill repeals the prior employer-assisted day care tax credit program under the
3377 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 36, section 5217. It establishes a new tax credit program that
3388 authorizes a refundable tax credit for an employer that pays for or provides in-kind
3399 resources for child care for the children of its employees. The amount of the annual credit
4400 is 50% of the amount expended up to a maximum of $8,000 per child or a total annual
4411 credit of $80,000, whichever is lower. The credit is available for tax years beginning on or
