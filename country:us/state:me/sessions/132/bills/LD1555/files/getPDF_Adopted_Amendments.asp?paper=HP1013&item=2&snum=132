1100 This amendment removes the refundability of the tax credit provided in the bill, reduces
1111 the number of years the tax credit may be carried forward from 15 to 5 and reduces the per
1122 child maximum tax credit from $8,000 to $3,000. It removes the $80,000 tax credit cap for
1133 an employer and instead caps an employer's reimbursement at $9,000 per participating
1144 employee. The amendment requires an employer to make the child care program available
1155 to any employee in the employment unit in order to qualify for the tax credit. It includes in
1166 the legislative review of the tax credit program an evaluation of employee retention and
1177 benefits data for participating employers with 50 or fewer employees.
