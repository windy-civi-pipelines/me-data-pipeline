1199 official documents from the list of forms of documentation accepted to verify the identity
2200 of an applicant who is registering to vote. Under the bill, acceptable photograph
2211 identification is a current and valid driver's license or nondriver identification card issued
2222 in this State, a United States passport, a military identification or a permit to carry a
2233 concealed handgun issued in this State if that permit includes a photograph. The bill
2244 provides that a student photograph identification document issued by a college or university
2255 in this State may not be accepted for voter identification when voting or when registering
2266 to vote. The bill also allows a person who does not possess a photograph identification
2277 document to request a free special voter photograph identification card from the Secretary
2288 of State.
