1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 5 MRSA c. 375, sub-c. 8 is enacted to read:
3 SUBCHAPTER 8
4 JUDICIAL DEFERENCE TO AGENCY INTERPRETATION
5 §11011. Judicial deference
6 When construing a statute that an agency administers, or rules that an agency has
7 adopted, a court must use the 2-part analysis in this section.
8 1. Unambiguous. If the statute or rule is unambiguous as viewed in the context of the
9 statute's or rule's subject matter and purpose, the court must give effect to its plain meaning.
10 The language of the statute or rule is considered unambiguous if it is not reasonably
11 susceptible to different interpretations.
12 2. Ambiguous. If the plain language of a statute or rule is ambiguous, the court shall
13 defer to the interpretation of the statute or rule by the agency charged with its
14 implementation if:
15 A. The interpretation of the statute or rule involves issues that are within the scope of
16 the agency's expertise; and
17 B. The agency's interpretation is reasonable.
18 The provisions of this subchapter do not exclude or limit any other appropriate exercise
19 of judicial deference to agency judgment or expertise.
20 SUMMARY
2211 This bill codifies judicial deference to agency interpretation of statutes and rules that
2222 agencies administer. The bill establishes a 2-part test to be used by courts when reviewing
2233 an agency's interpretation of a statute it administers or a rule it has adopted. The bill
2244 requires the court to give effect to the statute's or rule's plain meaning if the statute or rule
2255 is unambiguous. If the language of the statute or rule is ambiguous, the court is required
2266 to defer to the agency if the statute or rule is within the scope of the agency's expertise and
2277 the agency's interpretation is reasonable.
