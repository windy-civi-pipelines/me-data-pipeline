9 the 4th year, 6 1/2 mills for the 5th year and 4 mills for the 6th and succeeding years.

22 101, subsection 70, is based on the purchase price in the original year of title rather
23 than on the list price. Verification of purchase price for the application of excise

26 purchaser of a new vehicle.

36 of title is required to be issued, the amount of excise tax due is based on the maker's
37 list price of the prepackaged kit.

39 paragraph C, the excise tax must be prorated for the number of months in the
