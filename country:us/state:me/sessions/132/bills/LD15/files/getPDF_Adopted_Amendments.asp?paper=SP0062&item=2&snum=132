COMMITTEE AMENDMENT
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to S.P. 62, L.D. 15
1 (4) Annually, beginning in 2026, by September 15th, the assessor shall multiply
2 the cost-of-living adjustment for taxable years beginning in the succeeding
3 calendar year by the amounts in subparagraph (1). For purposes of this
4 subparagraph, "cost-of-living adjustment" means the Chained Consumer Price
5 Index, as defined in section 5402, subsection 1, for the 12-month period ending
6 June 30th of the preceding calendar year divided by the Chained Consumer Price
7 Index for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2025. The result must be rounded
8 to the nearest integer. If the cost-of-living adjustment for any calendar year would
9 be less than the cost-of-living adjustment for the preceding calendar year, the cost-
10 of-living adjustment is the same as for the preceding calendar year.'
11 Sec. 3. Effective date. This Act takes effect January 1, 2026.'
12 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section
13 number to read consecutively.
14 SUMMARY
1155 This amendment changes the title of the bill and, instead of eliminating the excise tax
1166 on camper trailers, changes the method of taxation of camper trailers. The amendment
1177 bases the tax on the length of the camper trailer instead of on the manufacturer's suggested
1188 retail price and the age of the camper trailer. The rate of tax is adjusted annually for
1199 inflation.
