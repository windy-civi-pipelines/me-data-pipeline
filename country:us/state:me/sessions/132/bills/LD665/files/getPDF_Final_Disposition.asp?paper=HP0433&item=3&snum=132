1. Temporary orders. The court may enter temporary orders authorized under
subsection 2 that it considers necessary to protect a plaintiff or minor child from abuse, on
good cause shown in an ex parte proceeding, which the court shall hear and determine as
expeditiously as practicable after the filing of a complaint. Immediate and present danger
of abuse to the plaintiff or minor child constitutes good cause. In determining whether
good cause exists, the court may consider the existence of an active military protective
order. A temporary order remains in effect pending a hearing pursuant to section 4109.
