11 (1) Before the defendant or the defendant's attorney can be heard, the plaintiff or
12 the plaintiff's employees may be in immediate and present danger of physical abuse
13 from the defendant or in immediate and present danger of suffering extreme
14 emotional distress as a result of the defendant's conduct, or the plaintiff's business
15 property is in immediate and present danger of suffering substantial damage as a
16 result of the defendant's actions;
17 (2-A) If the alleged harassment does not meet the definition in section 4651,
18 subsection 2, paragraph C or is not related to an allegation of domestic violence,
19 violence against a dating partner, sexual assault or stalking, the plaintiff has
20 obtained a copy of a notification issued against the other person as described in
21 Title 17‑A, section 506‑A, subsection 1, paragraph A, subparagraph (1), division

25 harassment; and
26 Sec. 3. 19-A MRSA §4102, sub-§7-A is enacted to read:

1 6. Civil Court rules apply. Unless otherwise indicated in this chapter, all proceedings
2 must be in accordance with the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure. Appeals may be taken as
3 provided by the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure. Appeals may be only for error of law or
4 abuse of discretion. The court may take judicial notice of a military protective order
5 pursuant to the Maine Rules of Evidence, Rule 201 in a proceeding under this chapter.

9 subsection 2 that it considers necessary to protect a plaintiff or minor child from abuse, on
10 good cause shown in an ex parte proceeding, which the court shall hear and determine as
11 expeditiously as practicable after the filing of a complaint. Immediate and present danger
12 of abuse to the plaintiff or minor child or the existence of an active military protective order
13 on behalf of the plaintiff against the defendant constitutes good cause. A temporary order
14 remains in effect pending a hearing pursuant to section 4109.
15 SUMMARY
1166 This bill defines "military protective order," which is a protection order given by a
1177 military commanding officer against a service member under the officer's command, and
1188 allows the use of military protective orders in protection from abuse and protection from
1199 harassment hearings.
