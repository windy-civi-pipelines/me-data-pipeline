An Act to Amend the Workers' Compensation Laws by Extending
Indefinitely the Presumption Applying to Law Enforcement Officers,
Corrections Officers, E-9-1-1 Dispatchers, Firefighters and Emergency
Medical Services Persons Diagnosed with Post-traumatic Stress Disorder
Mandate preamble. This measure requires one or more local units of government
to expand or modify activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures from local
revenues but does not provide funding for at least 90% of those expenditures. Pursuant to
the Constitution of Maine, Article IX, Section 21, 2/3 of all of the members elected to each
House have determined it necessary to enact this measure.
Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, the presumption applying to law enforcement officers, corrections officers,
E-9-1-1 dispatchers, firefighters and emergency medical services persons diagnosed with
post-traumatic stress disorder in the workers' compensation laws is necessary for the
recruitment and retainment of professionals employed in these career fields; and
Whereas, the presumption is set to expire on October 1, 2025, which may be before
the 90-day period has ended; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore,
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
Sec. 1. 39-A MRSA §201, sub-§3-A, ¶B, as amended by PL 2023, c. 405, Pt. A,
§143, is further amended by repealing the last blocked paragraph.
Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation
takes effect when approved.
