10 SUMMARY
1111 This amendment is the minority report of the committee. The amendment replaces the
1122 bill. The amendment makes the following changes to the paid family and medical leave
1133 benefits program.
14 1. It requires an employee to be employed with an employer for 120 days before being
15 eligible to take leave.
16 2. It clarifies that intermittent leave of an employee of less than one work day may not
17 be taken unless it is agreed to by the employee and the employer.
18 3. It provides examples of what type of conditions constitute undue hardship for an
19 employer and allows an employer to determine other conditions, based on that employer's
20 specific business, that constitute undue hardship. It also provides that the decision of an
21 employer to deny the requested scheduling of leave based on the examples provided is not
22 reviewable by the Department of Labor. It clarifies that a decision of an employer to deny
23 the scheduling of leave based on undue hardship for any condition other than the examples
24 is reviewable by the department.
25 4. It applies the same delay of implementation to private employers with collective
26 bargaining agreements as currently applies to public employers.
27 5. It prohibits the taking of paid leave unless the employee simultaneously takes any
28 available unpaid leave.
29 6. It establishes in statute the Bureau of Paid Family and Medical Leave within the
30 Department of Labor to administer the paid family and medical leave benefits program.
31 7. It establishes a benefit amount, regardless of income, of 65% of an employee's
32 average weekly wage.
33 8. It requires an employee to file an application for family leave benefits no more than
34 15 days after the start of family leave and to file an application for medical leave benefits
35 no more than 30 days after the start of the medical leave.
36 9. It provides that it is the obligation of the employee to pay premiums unless the
37 employer chooses to deduct premiums from the employee's wages.
38 10. It changes the applications of penalties against employers from mandatory to
39 discretionary.

1 11. It establishes remedies for the Department of Labor to enforce the collection of
2 delinquent premium contributions, penalties and assessments on employers that fail to
3 make payments required by the program.
4 12. It provides that an employer that provides a private plan in the form of self-
5 insurance in which the employer is a member of a group self-insurance trust that meets
6 specific criteria does not have to furnish a bond to the State.
7 13. It establishes penalties for employers that allow private plan benefit coverage to
8 lapse during a period of an approved private plan substitution.
9 14. It allows an employer whose private plan is approved by the Department of Labor
10 to request a refund of the premiums paid if that employer had a substantially equivalent
11 private plan in place before January 1, 2026. The department, after verifying the amount
12 paid by the employer, is required, within 30 days of receipt of the refund request, to refund
13 the employer the premiums paid, plus interest that accrues to the date the refund payment
14 is issued. It requires the employer to reimburse any employee from whom a premium was
15 collected and submitted to the department.
16 15. It establishes that the Department of Labor must determine approval of a private
17 plan within 30 days of receipt of an application and requires the department to update its
18 rules.
19 16. It clarifies that the provision that provides that an employee who takes leave is
20 entitled to be restored to the employee's former position does not apply to an employee who

10 SUMMARY
1111 This amendment is the minority report of the committee. The amendment replaces the
1122 bill. The amendment makes the following changes to the paid family and medical leave
1133 benefits program.
14 1. It requires an employee to be employed with an employer for 120 days before being
15 eligible to take leave.
16 2. It clarifies that intermittent leave of an employee of less than one work day may not
17 be taken unless it is agreed to by the employee and the employer.
18 3. It provides examples of what type of conditions constitute undue hardship for an
19 employer and allows an employer to determine other conditions, based on that employer's
20 specific business, that constitute undue hardship. It also provides that the decision of an
21 employer to deny the requested scheduling of leave based on the examples provided is not
22 reviewable by the Department of Labor. It clarifies that a decision of an employer to deny
23 the scheduling of leave based on undue hardship for any condition other than the examples
24 is reviewable by the department.
25 4. It applies the same delay of implementation to private employers with collective
26 bargaining agreements as currently applies to public employers.
27 5. It prohibits the taking of paid leave unless the employee simultaneously takes any
28 available unpaid leave.
29 6. It establishes in statute the Bureau of Paid Family and Medical Leave within the
30 Department of Labor to administer the paid family and medical leave benefits program.
31 7. It establishes a benefit amount, regardless of income, of 65% of an employee's
32 average weekly wage.
33 8. It requires an employee to file an application for family leave benefits no more than
34 15 days after the start of family leave and to file an application for medical leave benefits
35 no more than 30 days after the start of the medical leave.
36 9. It provides that it is the obligation of the employee to pay premiums unless the
37 employer chooses to deduct premiums from the employee's wages.
38 10. It changes the applications of penalties against employers from mandatory to
39 discretionary.

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 1147, L.D. 1712
1 11. It establishes remedies for the Department of Labor to enforce the collection of
2 delinquent premium contributions, penalties and assessments on employers that fail to
3 make payments required by the program.
4 12. It provides that an employer that provides a private plan in the form of self-
5 insurance in which the employer is a member of a group self-insurance trust that meets
6 specific criteria does not have to furnish a bond to the State.
7 13. It establishes penalties for employers that allow private plan benefit coverage to
8 lapse during a period of an approved private plan substitution.
9 14. It allows an employer whose private plan is approved by the Department of Labor
10 to request a refund of the premiums paid if that employer had a substantially equivalent
11 private plan in place before January 1, 2026. The department, after verifying the amount
12 paid by the employer, is required, within 30 days of receipt of the refund request, to refund
13 the employer the premiums paid, plus interest that accrues to the date the refund payment
14 is issued. It requires the employer to reimburse any employee from whom a premium was
15 collected and submitted to the department.
16 15. It establishes that the Department of Labor must determine approval of a private
17 plan within 30 days of receipt of an application and requires the department to update its
18 rules.
19 16. It clarifies that the provision that provides that an employee who takes leave is
20 entitled to be restored to the employee's former position does not apply to an employee who
21 is taking retroactive paid leave and who did not notify the employer for more than 10 days
22 of the employee's absence.
23 17. It provides that benefits paid from the program are subject to state income tax to
24 the extent those benefits are not included in the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income.
25 It also provides that a taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income may be reduced by the
26 amount subject to repayment that has been previously taxed by the State. It also allows
27 individuals filing a new claim for family leave benefits or medical leave benefits to elect
28 to have the administrator of the program deduct and withhold state income tax from the
29 individual's payment of benefits at the rate of 5% and requires the administrator of the
30 program to deduct and withhold state income tax. It also requires the department to advise
31 individuals filing a new claim for benefits that the benefits are subject to state income tax.
32 18. It places limits on the fees charged for private plan substitutions.
