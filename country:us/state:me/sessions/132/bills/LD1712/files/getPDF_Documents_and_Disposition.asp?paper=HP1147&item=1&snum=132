7 to prevent undue hardship on the employer as reasonably determined by the employer. If
8 an employer fails to provide notice as required under section 850‑I, the employee's

10 subsection, the conditions that constitute undue hardship include, but are not limited to:

21 operations.

13 SUMMARY
1144 This bill makes the following changes to the paid family and medical leave benefits
1155 program.
16 1. It provides examples of what type of conditions constitute undue hardship for an
17 employer and allows an employer to determine other conditions, based on that employer's
18 specific business, that constitute undue hardship. It also provides that the decision of an
19 employer to deny the use of leave based on undue hardship is not reviewable by the
20 Department of Labor.
21 2. It requires an employer to deduct from an employee's wages 50% of the payroll
22 premium, instead of allowing an employer to choose to deduct up to 50% of the payroll
23 premium, but allows an employer to pay any amount of the employee's share of the payroll
24 premium. It specifies that the existence of a collective bargaining agreement does not
25 prevent an employer from deducting an employee's share of the premium imposed to
26 finance the payment of benefits under the program nor does it require the employer to
27 bargain before making that deduction.
28 3. It extends to all employers subject to a collective bargaining agreement the
29 exemption for public employers or employees of a public employer subject to a collective
30 bargaining agreement from participating in the program until the expiration of the
31 collective bargaining agreement in effect on October 25, 2023.
32 4. It establishes a benefit amount, regardless of income, of 65% of an employee's
33 average weekly wage.
34 5. It requires an employee to file an application for family leave benefits no more than
35 15 days after the start of family leave and to file an application for medical leave benefits
36 no more than 30 days after the start of the medical leave.
37 6. It changes the fine imposed for failure or refusal by an employer to make premium
38 contributions to a maximum of $50 per employee. The fine is waivable by the department
39 if the department determines it is in the interest of equity and good conscience. It requires
40 the department to notify an employer and allows an employer to appeal the decision. It
41 allows an employer who is found to have failed or refused to make premium contributions
42 to retroactively deduct from an employee's wages that employee's share of the premium.
Page 4 - 132LR1651(01)

413 Finally, it stays the imposition of any fines until January 1, 2026 unless the employer
424 willfully fails or refuses to make the premium contributions.
3 7. It provides that benefits paid from the program are subject to state income tax to the
4 extent those benefits are not included in the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income. It
5 also provides that a taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income may be reduced by the amount
6 subject to repayment that has been previously taxed by the State. It also allows individuals
7 filing a new claim for family leave benefits or medical leave benefits to elect to have the
8 administrator of the program deduct and withhold state income tax from the individual's
9 payment of benefits at the rate of 5% and requires the administrator of the program to
10 deduct and withhold state income tax. It also requires the department to advise individuals
11 filing a new claim for benefits that the benefits are subject to state income tax.
