1 SUMMARY
22 This bill exempts from the real estate transfer tax home buyers who use the Maine State
33 Housing Authority's first-time home-buyer mortgage loan programs. It also increases the
44 real estate transfer tax from $2.20 to $5 per $500 for real estate sales over $1,000,000. The
55 bill directs the distribution of revenue derived from the tax collected on the transfer of
66 property by deed, which is part of the real estate transfer tax, as follows:
7 1. The amount necessary and sufficient to meet bond obligations under the Maine
8 Energy, Housing and Economic Recovery Program, distributed to the program;
9 2. Seventeen percent of that remaining balance, distributed to the Housing First Fund;
10 3. Fifteen percent of that remaining balance, distributed to the Housing Opportunities
11 for Maine Fund;
12 4. Sixty percent of that remaining balance, distributed to the State's affordable housing
13 income tax credit program and the Maine State Housing Authority's rural affordable rental
14 program and affordable homeownership program; and
15 5. The remaining balance distributed to the General Fund.
16 This bill also removes, beginning in fiscal year 2026-27, the requirement that 25% of
17 Housing Opportunities for Maine Fund funds be used for housing production.
