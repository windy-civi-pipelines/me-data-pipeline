21 SUMMARY
2222 This amendment, which is a minority report of the committee, replaces the changes
2233 made by the bill to the real estate transfer tax. The amendment increases the real estate
2244 transfer tax on property with a value of more than $1,000,000 to impose a tax of $4.00, or
2255 an additional $1.80, for each $500 of the value of the property being transferred above
2266 $1,000,000. The amendment changes the distribution of funds from the real estate transfer
2277 tax, including requiring 30% to be distributed to a new fund in the Maine State Housing
2288 Authority to support affordable housing, and requires the funds to be distributed as a
2299 percentage, not as a cascade. The amendment also specifies that the exemption from the
3300 real estate transfer tax for first-time home buyers receiving financial assistance through the
3311 Maine State Housing Authority applies to both the seller and the buyer of the property. The
3322 amendment also adds an appropriations and allocations section.
