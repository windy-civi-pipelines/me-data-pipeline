11 Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following:
12 'An Act Regarding the Regulation of Significant Vernal Pools Under the Natural
13 Resources Protection Act'
14 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and inserting the
15 following:
16 'Sec. 1. 38 MRSA §480-BB, sub-§1-A is enacted to read:
17 1-A. Significant vernal pool habitat; definitions. With respect to significant vernal
18 pool habitat, define:
19 A. "Critical terrestrial habitat" to mean uplands and wetlands associated with
20 significant vernal pools used by pool-breeding amphibians for migration, feeding and
21 hibernation, in particular, forested wetlands and forested uplands that provide deep
22 organic litter, coarse woody debris and canopy shade;
23 B. "Significant vernal pool habitat" to mean a significant vernal pool and that portion
24 of the critical terrestrial habitat within 250 feet of the spring or fall high-water mark of
25 the vernal pool depression; and
26 C. "Significant vernal pool protection zone" to mean that portion of the critical
27 terrestrial habitat within 100 feet of the spring or fall high-water mark of a significant
28 vernal pool depression. With respect to habitat management standards for significant
29 vernal pool habitat, the rule must require no disturbance within the significant vernal
30 pool depression and the significant vernal pool protection zone to the greatest extent
31 practicable;

1 2. Certain landowners not subject to regulation. Provide the following exemptions
2 to regulation.
3 A. A landowner proposing to cause an impact on the buffer area defined for a
4 significant vernal pool habitat is not subject to regulation pursuant to the rule if the
5 significant vernal pool habitat depression is not on property owned or controlled by
6 that landowner.
7 B. If a vernal pool depression is bisected by a property boundary and a landowner
8 proposing to cause an impact does not have permission to enter the abutting property,
9 only that portion of the vernal pool depression located on property owned or controlled
10 by that landowner may be considered in determining whether the vernal pool is
11 significant. A written department determination that a vernal pool is not significant
12 pursuant to this paragraph remains valid regardless of timeframe.
13 Where the critical terrestrial habitat for a significant vernal pool is bisected by one or
14 more property boundaries, the critical terrestrial habitat located on a property that does
15 not contain the vernal pool depression must be afforded the same habitat protections
16 under the rule as the critical terrestrial habitat located on the property that contains the
17 vernal pool depression.
18 C. Rules adopted under this section may not require an applicant for a license for a
19 working waterfront activity on working waterfront land that is part of a state or federal
20 brownfields program or a voluntary response action program under section 343‑E to
21 compensate for lost habitat function with a function of equal or greater value or to
22 provide a compensation fee pursuant to section 480‑Z;
23 Sec. 3. 38 MRSA §480-BB, sub-§4-A is enacted to read:
24 4-A. Identification of significant vernal pools; drying. Provide that, when a vernal
25 pool habitat has not previously been determined to be significant and the department or the
26 Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife makes a determination concerning whether
27 the vernal pool habitat is significant, either department may determine that the vernal pool
28 habitat is not significant if:
29 A. The vernal pool is located in northern Maine and dries out after filling and before
30 July 15th; or
31 B. The vernal pool is located in southern Maine and dries out after filling and before
32 July 1st;'

34 number to read consecutively.
35 SUMMARY
3366 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, changes the title of
3377 and replaces the bill, which is a concept draft. It amends provisions of the Natural
3388 Resources Protection Act regarding significant wildlife habitat to require the following
3399 provisions in the Department of Environmental Protection's rules regulating significant
4400 vernal pools.
41 1. It requires that the rules include definitions for "critical terrestrial habitat,"
42 "significant vernal pool habitat" and "significant vernal pool protection zone." "Significant

413 vernal pool protection zone" must be defined to mean that portion of the critical terrestrial
424 habitat within 100 feet of the spring or fall high-water mark of a significant vernal pool
435 depression. With respect to habitat management standards for significant vernal pool
446 habitat, the rule must require no disturbance within the significant vernal pool depression
457 and the significant vernal pool protection zone to the greatest extent practicable.
6 2. It provides that, where the critical terrestrial habitat for a significant vernal pool is
7 bisected by one or more property boundaries, the critical terrestrial habitat located on a
8 property that does not contain the vernal pool depression must be afforded the same habitat
9 protections under the rule as the critical terrestrial habitat located on the property that
10 contains the vernal pool depression. The amendment also repeals a provision of law
11 providing that a landowner proposing to cause an impact on the buffer area defined for a
12 significant vernal pool habitat is not subject to regulation pursuant to the rule if the
13 significant vernal pool habitat depression is not on property owned or controlled by that
14 landowner.
15 3. It provides that, when a vernal pool habitat has not previously been determined to
16 be significant and the Department of Environmental Protection or the Department of Inland
17 Fisheries and Wildlife makes a determination concerning whether the vernal pool habitat
18 is significant, the rule must provide that either department may determine that the vernal
19 pool habitat is not significant if the vernal pool is located in northern Maine and dries out
20 after filling and before July 15th or the vernal pool is located in southern Maine and dries
21 out after filling and before July 1st.
