6 different Probate Court system with full-time judges." The constitutional amendment in
7 Resolve 1967, chapter 77 was approved by a majority of the voters of Maine on November
8 7, 1967. It is the intent of the Legislature that the enactment of this Act, which creates a
9 statewide Probate Court with full-time judges, triggers the repeal of the Constitution of

5 court finds that the minor is indigent, the fees of an attorney appointed under this subsection
6 must be paid by the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services pursuant to Title 4,

19 burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the parent seeking to terminate
20 the guardianship is currently unfit to regain custody of the minor, in accordance with the
21 standard set forth in section 5‑204, subsection 2, paragraph C. If the party opposing
22 termination of the guardianship fails to meet its burden of proof on the question of the
23 parent's fitness to regain custody, the court shall terminate the guardianship and make any
24 further order that may be appropriate. In a contested action, the court may appoint counsel
25 for the minor or for any indigent guardian or parent. If the court finds that the minor,

28 a District Court order terminating parental rights, appointing a guardian, including a
29 permanency, emergency or interim guardian, awarding parental rights to a 3rd party or

32 the District Court under this subsection, the District Court has continuing, exclusive
33 jurisdiction over the matter and over any future proceedings for guardianship, adoption or

11 provided in Title 18-C, section 5-105, when a case is originally within the jurisdiction of
12 the Probate Court in 2 or more counties, the one that first commences proceedings retains
13 jurisdiction exclusively throughout. The jurisdiction assumed in any case, except in cases
14 of fraud, so far as it depends on the residence of any person or the locality or amount of

19 §415. Continuous session; return day for matters requiring public notice
20 The Probate Court is always open in each county for all matters over which it has
21 jurisdiction, except upon days on which by law no court is held, but it shall have certain
22 fixed days and places to be made known by public notification thereof in their respective
23 counties to which all matters requiring public notice must be made returnable, except as
24 otherwise ordered by the Chief Judge of the Probate Court. In case of the absence of the
25 assigned Probate Court Judge at the time of holding any court, the Register of Probate or
26 acting register may adjourn the same unless the Chief Judge of the Probate Court assigns
27 another Probate Court Judge to attend.
28 §416. Conflict of interest; transfer of proceeding
29 1. Probate Court Judge conflict of interest. When a Probate Court Judge is
30 interested in that judge's own right in a trust that is not fully executed, or in any other
31 manner in an estate, or is within the degree of kindred by which in law that judge may, by
32 possibility, be heir to any part of the estate of the person deceased, or is named as executor,
33 trustee of a trust that is not fully executed or guardian of minor children in the will of any
34 deceased resident of the county, the judge must be recused from any proceedings related to
35 the trust or settlement of the estate unless said disability is removed.
36 This subsection may not be construed to require recusal by a Probate Court Judge who is
37 named as executor, trustee or guardian of minor children in a will if the judge does not
38 receive a benefit from the will and the record of the court discloses the filing of the judge's
39 declination to act as such executor, trustee or guardian and if no objection is raised by any
40 interested party at the hearing on the petition for probate of the will.
41 2. Probate Court Judge not to draft documents. A Probate Court Judge may not
42 draft or aid in drafting any document or paper that the Probate Court Judge is by law
43 required to pass upon.
Page 35 - 132LR1103(01)
1 3. Register of Probate conflict of interest; transfer of proceeding. When a Register
2 of Probate is interested in that register's own right in a trust that is not fully executed, or in
3 any other manner in an estate, or is within the degree of kindred by which in law that
4 register may, by possibility, be heir to any part of the estate of the person deceased, or is
5 named as executor, trustee of a trust that is not fully executed or guardian of minor children
6 in the will of any deceased resident of the county, such estate must be settled in the Probate
7 Court of any adjoining county, which has full jurisdiction thereof as if the deceased had
8 died in that adjoining county. If the register's interest arises after jurisdiction over such
9 estate has been assumed or existed at the time of the register's election to office, and in all
10 cases where an executor, administrator, guardian or trustee, whose trust is not fully
11 executed, becomes the Register of Probate for the county in which that register's letters
12 were granted, further proceedings must be transferred to the Probate Court in any adjoining
13 county and there remain until completed, unless said disability is removed before that time.
14 Whenever in any case within this subsection the disability of the Register of Probate is
15 removed before the proceedings have been fully completed, the proceedings must then be
16 transferred to the Probate Court in the county of original jurisdiction or to the Probate Court
17 that otherwise would have had jurisdiction. In all such cases the register in such adjoining
18 county shall transmit copies of all records relating to such estate to the probate office of the
19 county where such estate belongs, to be there recorded. If there are fewer than 4 counties
20 adjoining the county of the Probate Court that is required to transfer proceedings to an
21 adjoining county under this subsection, the proceedings must be transferred to the Probate
22 Court in one of the 4 counties nearest to the transferring Probate Court, as measured by the
23 shortest distance along paved roads between the building in which the registry of probate
24 is located in the transferring county and the building in which the registry of probate is
25 located in the other county.
26 This subsection may not be construed to require removal to another county by reason of
27 the Register of Probate having been named as executor, trustee or guardian of minor
28 children in a will, if the register does not receive a benefit from the will and the record of
29 the court discloses the filing of the register's declination to act as such executor, trustee or
30 guardian and if no objection is raised by any interested party at the hearing on the petition
31 for probate of the will.
32 §417. Rights of claimants under heir
33 Any person claiming under an heir at law has the same rights as the heir in all
34 proceedings in Probate Court, including rights of appeal.
35 §418. Perpetual care of cemetery lots by order
36 In any case in which an estate is under the Probate Court's jurisdiction for probate, the
37 Probate Court may order that an appropriate amount out of the estate be set aside for
38 perpetual care and suitable memorials for the cemetery lot in which the deceased is buried
39 and order special care of such lots when the conditions and size of the estate seem to warrant
40 such order.
41 §419. Contracts for support
42 1. Approval required. All contracts for support for life must be approved by the
43 Probate Court in the county in which the support for life is to be rendered. The Probate
44 Court shall grant approval after such reasonable notice as the court determines to be
Page 36 - 132LR1103(01)
415 appropriate, if the court finds, after hearing, that the contract is just and equitable under all
426 of the circumstances.
3 2. Admissibility in evidence. A contract or agreement for support for life that has not
4 been approved under subsection 1 may not be received in evidence unless the person
5 offering the contract or agreement establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the
6 contract or agreement is just and equitable under all of the circumstances.
7 3. Exception. This section does not apply to contracts or agreements for support for
8 life between persons related within the 3rd degree.
9 §420. Commission to Evaluate the Incorporation of the Probate Court into the
10 Judicial Branch
11 1. Commission established. The Commission to Evaluate the Incorporation of the

29 SUMMARY
3300 This bill implements the recommendations of the Commission To Create a Plan To
3311 Incorporate the Probate Courts into the Judicial Branch, referred to in this summary as "the
3322 commission." The report is available online at https://legislature.maine.gov/doc/7703.
33 Maine's county Probate Courts occupy a unique position in Maine's justice system.
34 Unlike Maine's other trial courts, Probate Courts are not part of the state judicial branch
35 and Probate Court Judges are not appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the
36 Legislature. Instead, pursuant to the former Constitution of Maine, Article VI, Section 6,
37 Probate Court Judges and Registers of Probate are elected to 4-year terms in each county.
38 Although the caseload varies from county to county, it is generally understood that Maine's
39 county Probate Court Judges serve on a part-time basis and, accordingly, they are
40 authorized to engage in the practice of law.
41 In 1967, the Legislature passed Resolve 1967, chapter 77, which proposed an
42 amendment to the Constitution of Maine that would repeal Article VI, Section 6 and would
Page 40 - 132LR1103(01)
413 "become effective at such time as the Legislature by proper enactment shall establish a
424 different Probate Court system with full-time judges." This constitutional amendment was
435 approved by a majority of the voters of Maine on November 7, 1967. In its report, the
446 commission recommended that the Legislature implement this constitutional amendment
457 by establishing a new state Probate Court with full-time, appointed state Probate Court
468 Judges. Part A of the bill sets out that it is the intent of the Legislature that the enactment
479 of this legislation, which implements the commission's recommended new Probate Court
580 system with full-time judges, will trigger the repeal of the Constitution of Maine, Article
591 VI, Section 6 pursuant to Resolve 1967, chapter 77 on the date that this legislation is
1502 approved.
11 Although this bill is intended to trigger the repeal of the Constitution of Maine, Article
12 VI, Section 6, which provides for the election of probate judges, the commission did not
13 recommend and the bill does not provide for the removal from office of any county Probate
14 Court Judge prior to the expiration of the term to which the judge was previously elected
15 under the Constitution. To avoid that result, the commission recommended a multiyear,
16 multistep process for establishing a new state Probate Court with full-time judges. Part B
17 of the bill, which is effective immediately, Part C of the bill, which is effective January 1,
18 2027, and Part D of the bill, which is effective January 1, 2029, implement this multiyear,
19 multistep process as follows.
20 1. Parts B and D of the bill establish a state Probate Court within the judicial branch
21 that is distinct from the District Court and Superior Court. By January 1, 2029, the state
22 Probate Court will be staffed by 9 full-time judges appointed by the Governor and
23 confirmed by the Legislature, including one judge assigned to serve as the primary judge
24 in each of 8 new Probate Court regions that will be aligned with the State's 8 prosecutorial
25 districts.
26 A. When the terms of the incumbent probate judges in Androscoggin, Franklin, Knox
27 and Penobscot counties expire on December 31, 2026, they will be replaced by county
28 Probate Court Judges elected to 2-year terms that will expire on December 31, 2028.
29 B. When the terms of the incumbent probate judges in Cumberland, Hancock and
30 Washington counties expire on December 31, 2026, they will be replaced by 4 new
31 state Probate Court Judges appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Legislature
32 in the same manner that District Court Judges and Superior Court Justices are appointed
33 and confirmed for terms that commence January 1, 2027. Although not reflected in the
34 text of the bill, the commission also recommended that these judges be supported by
35 one new law clerk, one new judicial administrative assistant and 4 new court marshals.
36 C. Beginning January 1, 2027, the 4 new state Probate Court Judges will preside over
37 probate proceedings in Cumberland, Hancock and Washington counties while the
38 remainder of the State's 16 counties will continue to be served by an elected county
39 Probate Court Judge. If a judicial vacancy occurs in a county Probate Court after
40 January 1, 2027 due to the death, resignation or retirement of the elected county Probate
41 Court Judge, the vacant position will not be filled and jurisdiction over that county's
42 probate matters will be transferred to the new state Probate Court. If the Chief Justice
43 of the Supreme Judicial Court determines that the number of state Probate Court Judges
44 is insufficient to provide for the efficient administration of justice in all of the counties
45 served by the new state Probate Court, the Chief Justice may request that the Governor
46 appoint an additional state Probate Court Judge. Although not reflected in the text of
Page 41 - 132LR1103(01)
417 the bill, to ensure that funding is available for all of the new potential state judgeships
428 as they arise, the commission also recommended that all 9 new state Probate Court
439 Judge positions be funded through General Fund appropriations commencing on
540 January 1, 2027.
5 D. When the terms of all remaining county Probate Court Judges expire on December
6 31, 2028, they will be replaced by the number of new state Probate Court Judges
7 necessary to achieve a full complement of 9 state Probate Court Judges. Although not
8 reflected in the text of the bill, the commission also recommended that these new judges
9 be supported by a 2nd law clerk and judicial administrative assistant and by 5 additional
10 court marshals.
11 E. Although not reflected in the text of the bill, the commission also recommended
12 that the judicial branch be authorized to hire an information technology specialist and
13 a facilities manager as soon as possible, and that General Fund appropriations be
14 provided for that purpose, to help the judicial branch prepare for the establishment of
15 the state Probate Court on January 1, 2027.
16 2. Parts B, C and D of the bill direct the Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court
17 to designate one appointed state Probate Court Judge to serve as the Chief Judge of the
18 Probate Court, who is charged with fulfilling administrative duties similar to the
19 administrative duties of the Chief Justice of the Superior Court and Chief Judge of the
20 District Court. These duties include facilitating the transition from the county Probate
21 Court system to the state Probate Court system; creating the statewide Probate Court
22 schedule; ensuring uniformity of court processes and procedures and that emergency
23 matters are prioritized and addressed expediently; securing and ensuring the accessibility
24 and safety of Probate Court facilities; and preparing annual reports on the business of the
25 state Probate Court.
26 3. Parts C and D of the bill direct that state Probate Court proceedings be held in
27 existing county Probate Court facilities if possible and require the Chief Judge of the
28 Probate Court to negotiate leases, contracts or other arrangements between the counties and
29 the judicial branch regarding the use of those facilities. When necessary, state District Court
30 and Superior Court facilities may also be used for Probate Court proceedings.
31 4. Parts B, C and D of the bill preserve the county registries of probate.
32 A. Part B of the bill provides, by statute, for the election of county Registers of Probate
33 under the same terms and conditions applicable to county register of probate elections
34 under the Constitution of Maine, Article VI, Section 6, which will be repealed on the
35 date that this legislation is approved.
36 B. Parts B, C and D of the bill further provide that, as each county transitions to the
37 state Probate Court, that county should continue to retain all fees filed in state Probate
38 Court proceedings in that county to offset the costs of maintaining its county registry
39 of probate and of paying registry staff. These costs include, for example, the cost to
40 maintain the current electronic management system for probate court records that the
41 commission recommended retaining during the multiyear transition to the new state
42 Probate Court system.
43 5. Part C of the bill provides that, beginning January 1, 2027, the Maine Commission
44 on Public Defense Services is responsible for paying and for establishing the minimum
Page 42 - 132LR1103(01)
415 experience, training and additional qualifications for attorneys appointed to represent
426 indigent individuals at public expense in all state and county Probate Court proceedings.
437 Although not reflected in the text of the bill, the commission further recommended that the
448 Legislature provide new General Fund appropriations to the Maine Commission on Public
459 Defense Services to cover the cost of these appointments.
6 6. Parts C and D of the bill require the judicial branch to establish the minimum
7 experience, training and additional qualifications for court-appointed visitors in state
8 Probate Court proceedings and to pay the expenses of both court-appointed visitors and
9 court-appointed guardians ad litem in state Probate Court proceedings when the parties are
10 indigent or the court is allowed or directed by law to pay these expenses. Although not
11 reflected in the text of the bill, the commission recommended that the Legislature provide
12 new General Fund appropriations to the judicial branch to cover the expenses associated
13 with the new requirements. Part C of the bill clarifies that, if a guardian ad litem or visitor
14 is appointed at public expense in a county Probate Court proceeding, the county remains
15 responsible for paying the court-appointed professional's fees.
16 7. Finally, Part D of the bill establishes the Commission to Evaluate the Incorporation
17 of the Probate Court into the Judicial Branch, a 15-member study group composed of the
18 same categories of members appointed to the Commission To Create a Plan To Incorporate
19 the Probate Courts into the Judicial Branch. Part D of the bill directs the new commission
20 to conduct a thorough review of the new state Probate Court system in 2031, which must
21 include, but is not limited to, evaluating whether the number of supported state Probate
22 Court Judge positions proposed is appropriate or should be adjusted; whether the
23 jurisdiction of the state Probate Court, District Court and Superior Court should be adjusted
24 to increase judicial efficiency and access to justice; whether to authorize assignment of
25 state Probate Court Judges to preside over District Court or Superior Court dockets to the
26 same extent that the judges in the District Court and justices in the Superior Court are
27 available for cross assignments; whether additional investments should be made to enhance
28 the compatibility of the Probate Court and judicial branch electronic case management
29 systems; and whether additional opportunities exist to advance toward the ultimate goal of
30 fully incorporating the Probate Court system into the judicial branch. No later than
31 December 31, 2031, the commission is required to submit a report that includes its findings
32 and recommendations, which may include suggested legislation, for presentation to the
33 joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary matters. The
34 joint standing committee may report out legislation related to the report to the 135th
35 Legislature.

6 different Probate Court system with full-time judges." The constitutional amendment in

33 of their death, were inhabitants or residents of the county or who, not being residents
34 of the county, died leaving an estate to be administered in the county, or whose estate
35 is afterwards found in the county; and has jurisdiction of all matters relating to the
36 settlement of such estates.

410 jurisdiction may be exercised upon complaint according to the usual course of
421 proceedings in civil actions in which equitable relief is sought.
3 2. Adoptions, name changes, guardianships, conservatorships and other

10 Court shall require all parties in any matter involving guardianship, adoption or change of
11 name or another matter involving custody or other parental rights with respect to a minor

19 with respect to the minor child pending before any court of this State or another state,

21 C. Any other related action pending before any court of this State or another state,
22 including the District Court.

27 minor child is pending in the District Court or that the minor child is or was the subject of
28 a District Court order terminating parental rights, appointing a guardian, including a
29 permanency, emergency or interim guardian, awarding parental rights to a 3rd party or
30 granting an adoption, the Probate Court shall notify the District Court and take appropriate
31 action to facilitate a transfer of the matter to the District Court. If a matter is transferred to
32 the District Court under this subsection, the District Court has continuing, exclusive
33 jurisdiction over the matter and over any future proceedings for guardianship, adoption or
34 change of name or other matter involving custody or other parental rights with respect to
35 the minor child brought under Title 18‑C, except to the extent that the District Court's
36 jurisdiction is precluded by the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act.

38 Probate Court shall retain jurisdiction over an action for guardianship, adoption, change of
39 name or other matter involving custody or other parental rights with respect to a minor
40 child brought under Title 18‑C that would otherwise be within the exclusive, continuing
41 jurisdiction of the District Court under section 152, subsection 5‑A and may not transfer
42 that matter to the District Court under subsection 2 if:
43 A. At the time the proceeding under the Maine Juvenile Code or the proceeding
44 involving custody or other parental rights with respect to the minor child that would
Page 31 - 132LR1103(01)

415 otherwise trigger the District Court's continuing, exclusive jurisdiction is initiated, the
426 testimonial hearing on the Title 18‑C matter has concluded and the Probate Court has
437 that matter under advisement; and
4 B. The Probate Court has not determined that the District Court is the more appropriate
5 forum for the Title 18‑C proceeding.
6 For purposes of this section, a proceeding is pending if a complaint, petition or post-
7 judgment motion has been filed and the final judgment or final order on that complaint,
8 petition or post-judgment motion has not yet been issued.
9 §410. Jurisdiction in court where proceedings originate
10 Subject to Title 18-C, sections 1-303, 3-201, 5-106 and 9-104, and except as otherwise
11 provided in Title 18-C, section 5-105, when a case is originally within the jurisdiction of
12 the Probate Court in 2 or more counties, the one that first commences proceedings retains
13 jurisdiction exclusively throughout. The jurisdiction assumed in any case, except in cases
14 of fraud, so far as it depends on the residence of any person or the locality or amount of
15 property, may not be contested in any proceeding except on an appeal or removal from the
16 Probate Court in the original case or when the want of jurisdiction appears on the same
17 record.

23 B. Region 2 consists of Cumberland County;
24 C. Region 3 consists of Oxford, Franklin and Androscoggin counties;

30 2. Assignment. The Chief Judge of the Probate Court shall assign at least one Probate
31 Court Judge as the primary judge to hold court in each region.
32 3. Place for holding court. In each county within each region, the Chief Judge of the
33 Probate Court shall designate a place for holding court that is located, to the extent possible
34 given the other requirements of this subsection, in the building holding the office of that
35 county's Register of Probate. The Chief Judge, with the advice and approval of the
36 Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of General Services, is
37 empowered to negotiate on behalf of the State the leases, contracts and other arrangements
38 the Chief Judge considers necessary, within the limits of the budget and funds available, to
39 provide suitable quarters, adequately furnished and equipped for the Probate Court in each
40 county.
41 If the Chief Judge is unable to negotiate the leases, contracts and other arrangements as
42 provided in this subsection, the Chief Judge may, with the advice and approval of the
Page 34 - 132LR1103(01)

413 Bureau of General Services, negotiate on behalf of the State the leases, contracts and other
424 arrangements the Chief Judge considers necessary, within the limits of the budget and funds
435 available, to provide suitable quarters, adequately furnished and equipped for the Probate
446 Court in other publicly owned or privately owned buildings.
5 4. Exception; Aroostook County. Notwithstanding subsection 3, the Chief Judge of

7 least 2 times each year at Fort Kent and at least 4 times each year at Caribou. The time for
8 holding the court must be appointed by the Chief Judge of the Probate Court and made

10 5. Exception; alternative locations. Notwithstanding subsection 3, the Probate Court
11 may hold hearings for matters in equity and contested cases at such time and place in the
12 county as the Probate Court may appoint and make all necessary orders and decrees relating
13 thereto.
14 §414. Officers execute processes and attend courts
15 Sheriffs, their deputies and constables shall execute all legal processes directed to them
16 by a Probate Court, which may, when necessary, require such officer, when not in
17 attendance upon any other court, to attend during the sitting of the Probate Court, for which
18 that officer must be paid as in other courts for similar services.
19 §415. Continuous session; return day for matters requiring public notice
20 The Probate Court is always open in each county for all matters over which it has
21 jurisdiction, except upon days on which by law no court is held, but it shall have certain
22 fixed days and places to be made known by public notification thereof in their respective
23 counties to which all matters requiring public notice must be made returnable, except as
24 otherwise ordered by the Chief Judge of the Probate Court. In case of the absence of the
25 assigned Probate Court Judge at the time of holding any court, the Register of Probate or
26 acting register may adjourn the same unless the Chief Judge of the Probate Court assigns
27 another Probate Court Judge to attend.
28 §416. Conflict of interest; transfer of proceeding
29 1. Probate Court Judge conflict of interest. When a Probate Court Judge is
30 interested in that judge's own right in a trust that is not fully executed, or in any other
31 manner in an estate, or is within the degree of kindred by which in law that judge may, by
32 possibility, be heir to any part of the estate of the person deceased, or is named as executor,
33 trustee of a trust that is not fully executed or guardian of minor children in the will of any
34 deceased resident of the county, the judge must be recused from any proceedings related to
35 the trust or settlement of the estate unless said disability is removed.
36 This subsection may not be construed to require recusal by a Probate Court Judge who is
37 named as executor, trustee or guardian of minor children in a will if the judge does not
38 receive a benefit from the will and the record of the court discloses the filing of the judge's
39 declination to act as such executor, trustee or guardian and if no objection is raised by any
40 interested party at the hearing on the petition for probate of the will.
41 2. Probate Court Judge not to draft documents. A Probate Court Judge may not
42 draft or aid in drafting any document or paper that the Probate Court Judge is by law
43 required to pass upon.
Page 35 - 132LR1103(01)

1 3. Register of Probate conflict of interest; transfer of proceeding. When a Register
2 of Probate is interested in that register's own right in a trust that is not fully executed, or in
3 any other manner in an estate, or is within the degree of kindred by which in law that
4 register may, by possibility, be heir to any part of the estate of the person deceased, or is
5 named as executor, trustee of a trust that is not fully executed or guardian of minor children
6 in the will of any deceased resident of the county, such estate must be settled in the Probate
7 Court of any adjoining county, which has full jurisdiction thereof as if the deceased had
8 died in that adjoining county. If the register's interest arises after jurisdiction over such
9 estate has been assumed or existed at the time of the register's election to office, and in all
10 cases where an executor, administrator, guardian or trustee, whose trust is not fully
11 executed, becomes the Register of Probate for the county in which that register's letters
12 were granted, further proceedings must be transferred to the Probate Court in any adjoining
13 county and there remain until completed, unless said disability is removed before that time.
14 Whenever in any case within this subsection the disability of the Register of Probate is
15 removed before the proceedings have been fully completed, the proceedings must then be
16 transferred to the Probate Court in the county of original jurisdiction or to the Probate Court
17 that otherwise would have had jurisdiction. In all such cases the register in such adjoining
18 county shall transmit copies of all records relating to such estate to the probate office of the
19 county where such estate belongs, to be there recorded. If there are fewer than 4 counties
20 adjoining the county of the Probate Court that is required to transfer proceedings to an
21 adjoining county under this subsection, the proceedings must be transferred to the Probate
22 Court in one of the 4 counties nearest to the transferring Probate Court, as measured by the
23 shortest distance along paved roads between the building in which the registry of probate
24 is located in the transferring county and the building in which the registry of probate is
25 located in the other county.
26 This subsection may not be construed to require removal to another county by reason of
27 the Register of Probate having been named as executor, trustee or guardian of minor
28 children in a will, if the register does not receive a benefit from the will and the record of
29 the court discloses the filing of the register's declination to act as such executor, trustee or
30 guardian and if no objection is raised by any interested party at the hearing on the petition
31 for probate of the will.
32 §417. Rights of claimants under heir
33 Any person claiming under an heir at law has the same rights as the heir in all
34 proceedings in Probate Court, including rights of appeal.
35 §418. Perpetual care of cemetery lots by order
36 In any case in which an estate is under the Probate Court's jurisdiction for probate, the
37 Probate Court may order that an appropriate amount out of the estate be set aside for
38 perpetual care and suitable memorials for the cemetery lot in which the deceased is buried
39 and order special care of such lots when the conditions and size of the estate seem to warrant
40 such order.
41 §419. Contracts for support
42 1. Approval required. All contracts for support for life must be approved by the
43 Probate Court in the county in which the support for life is to be rendered. The Probate
44 Court shall grant approval after such reasonable notice as the court determines to be
Page 36 - 132LR1103(01)

415 appropriate, if the court finds, after hearing, that the contract is just and equitable under all
426 of the circumstances.
3 2. Admissibility in evidence. A contract or agreement for support for life that has not
4 been approved under subsection 1 may not be received in evidence unless the person
5 offering the contract or agreement establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the
6 contract or agreement is just and equitable under all of the circumstances.
7 3. Exception. This section does not apply to contracts or agreements for support for
8 life between persons related within the 3rd degree.
9 §420. Commission to Evaluate the Incorporation of the Probate Court into the
10 Judicial Branch
11 1. Commission established. The Commission to Evaluate the Incorporation of the

29 SUMMARY
3300 This bill implements the recommendations of the Commission To Create a Plan To
3311 Incorporate the Probate Courts into the Judicial Branch, referred to in this summary as "the
3322 commission." The report is available online at https://legislature.maine.gov/doc/7703.
33 Maine's county Probate Courts occupy a unique position in Maine's justice system.
34 Unlike Maine's other trial courts, Probate Courts are not part of the state judicial branch
35 and Probate Court Judges are not appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the
36 Legislature. Instead, pursuant to the former Constitution of Maine, Article VI, Section 6,
37 Probate Court Judges and Registers of Probate are elected to 4-year terms in each county.
38 Although the caseload varies from county to county, it is generally understood that Maine's
39 county Probate Court Judges serve on a part-time basis and, accordingly, they are
40 authorized to engage in the practice of law.
41 In 1967, the Legislature passed Resolve 1967, chapter 77, which proposed an
42 amendment to the Constitution of Maine that would repeal Article VI, Section 6 and would
Page 40 - 132LR1103(01)

413 "become effective at such time as the Legislature by proper enactment shall establish a
424 different Probate Court system with full-time judges." This constitutional amendment was
435 approved by a majority of the voters of Maine on November 7, 1967. In its report, the
446 commission recommended that the Legislature implement this constitutional amendment
457 by establishing a new state Probate Court with full-time, appointed state Probate Court
468 Judges. Part A of the bill sets out that it is the intent of the Legislature that the enactment
479 of this legislation, which implements the commission's recommended new Probate Court
580 system with full-time judges, will trigger the repeal of the Constitution of Maine, Article
591 VI, Section 6 pursuant to Resolve 1967, chapter 77 on the date that this legislation is
1502 approved.
11 Although this bill is intended to trigger the repeal of the Constitution of Maine, Article
12 VI, Section 6, which provides for the election of probate judges, the commission did not
13 recommend and the bill does not provide for the removal from office of any county Probate
14 Court Judge prior to the expiration of the term to which the judge was previously elected
15 under the Constitution. To avoid that result, the commission recommended a multiyear,
16 multistep process for establishing a new state Probate Court with full-time judges. Part B
17 of the bill, which is effective immediately, Part C of the bill, which is effective January 1,
18 2027, and Part D of the bill, which is effective January 1, 2029, implement this multiyear,
19 multistep process as follows.
20 1. Parts B and D of the bill establish a state Probate Court within the judicial branch
21 that is distinct from the District Court and Superior Court. By January 1, 2029, the state
22 Probate Court will be staffed by 9 full-time judges appointed by the Governor and
23 confirmed by the Legislature, including one judge assigned to serve as the primary judge
24 in each of 8 new Probate Court regions that will be aligned with the State's 8 prosecutorial
25 districts.
26 A. When the terms of the incumbent probate judges in Androscoggin, Franklin, Knox
27 and Penobscot counties expire on December 31, 2026, they will be replaced by county
28 Probate Court Judges elected to 2-year terms that will expire on December 31, 2028.
29 B. When the terms of the incumbent probate judges in Cumberland, Hancock and
30 Washington counties expire on December 31, 2026, they will be replaced by 4 new
31 state Probate Court Judges appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Legislature
32 in the same manner that District Court Judges and Superior Court Justices are appointed
33 and confirmed for terms that commence January 1, 2027. Although not reflected in the
34 text of the bill, the commission also recommended that these judges be supported by
35 one new law clerk, one new judicial administrative assistant and 4 new court marshals.
36 C. Beginning January 1, 2027, the 4 new state Probate Court Judges will preside over
37 probate proceedings in Cumberland, Hancock and Washington counties while the
38 remainder of the State's 16 counties will continue to be served by an elected county
39 Probate Court Judge. If a judicial vacancy occurs in a county Probate Court after
40 January 1, 2027 due to the death, resignation or retirement of the elected county Probate
41 Court Judge, the vacant position will not be filled and jurisdiction over that county's
42 probate matters will be transferred to the new state Probate Court. If the Chief Justice
43 of the Supreme Judicial Court determines that the number of state Probate Court Judges
44 is insufficient to provide for the efficient administration of justice in all of the counties
45 served by the new state Probate Court, the Chief Justice may request that the Governor
46 appoint an additional state Probate Court Judge. Although not reflected in the text of
Page 41 - 132LR1103(01)

417 the bill, to ensure that funding is available for all of the new potential state judgeships
428 as they arise, the commission also recommended that all 9 new state Probate Court
439 Judge positions be funded through General Fund appropriations commencing on
540 January 1, 2027.
5 D. When the terms of all remaining county Probate Court Judges expire on December
6 31, 2028, they will be replaced by the number of new state Probate Court Judges
7 necessary to achieve a full complement of 9 state Probate Court Judges. Although not
8 reflected in the text of the bill, the commission also recommended that these new judges
9 be supported by a 2nd law clerk and judicial administrative assistant and by 5 additional
10 court marshals.
11 E. Although not reflected in the text of the bill, the commission also recommended
12 that the judicial branch be authorized to hire an information technology specialist and
13 a facilities manager as soon as possible, and that General Fund appropriations be
14 provided for that purpose, to help the judicial branch prepare for the establishment of
15 the state Probate Court on January 1, 2027.
16 2. Parts B, C and D of the bill direct the Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court
17 to designate one appointed state Probate Court Judge to serve as the Chief Judge of the
18 Probate Court, who is charged with fulfilling administrative duties similar to the
19 administrative duties of the Chief Justice of the Superior Court and Chief Judge of the
20 District Court. These duties include facilitating the transition from the county Probate
21 Court system to the state Probate Court system; creating the statewide Probate Court
22 schedule; ensuring uniformity of court processes and procedures and that emergency
23 matters are prioritized and addressed expediently; securing and ensuring the accessibility
24 and safety of Probate Court facilities; and preparing annual reports on the business of the
25 state Probate Court.
26 3. Parts C and D of the bill direct that state Probate Court proceedings be held in
27 existing county Probate Court facilities if possible and require the Chief Judge of the
28 Probate Court to negotiate leases, contracts or other arrangements between the counties and
29 the judicial branch regarding the use of those facilities. When necessary, state District Court
30 and Superior Court facilities may also be used for Probate Court proceedings.
31 4. Parts B, C and D of the bill preserve the county registries of probate.
32 A. Part B of the bill provides, by statute, for the election of county Registers of Probate
33 under the same terms and conditions applicable to county register of probate elections
34 under the Constitution of Maine, Article VI, Section 6, which will be repealed on the
35 date that this legislation is approved.
36 B. Parts B, C and D of the bill further provide that, as each county transitions to the
37 state Probate Court, that county should continue to retain all fees filed in state Probate
38 Court proceedings in that county to offset the costs of maintaining its county registry
39 of probate and of paying registry staff. These costs include, for example, the cost to
40 maintain the current electronic management system for probate court records that the
41 commission recommended retaining during the multiyear transition to the new state
42 Probate Court system.
43 5. Part C of the bill provides that, beginning January 1, 2027, the Maine Commission
44 on Public Defense Services is responsible for paying and for establishing the minimum
Page 42 - 132LR1103(01)

415 experience, training and additional qualifications for attorneys appointed to represent
426 indigent individuals at public expense in all state and county Probate Court proceedings.
437 Although not reflected in the text of the bill, the commission further recommended that the
448 Legislature provide new General Fund appropriations to the Maine Commission on Public
459 Defense Services to cover the cost of these appointments.
6 6. Parts C and D of the bill require the judicial branch to establish the minimum
7 experience, training and additional qualifications for court-appointed visitors in state
8 Probate Court proceedings and to pay the expenses of both court-appointed visitors and
9 court-appointed guardians ad litem in state Probate Court proceedings when the parties are
10 indigent or the court is allowed or directed by law to pay these expenses. Although not
11 reflected in the text of the bill, the commission recommended that the Legislature provide
12 new General Fund appropriations to the judicial branch to cover the expenses associated
13 with the new requirements. Part C of the bill clarifies that, if a guardian ad litem or visitor
14 is appointed at public expense in a county Probate Court proceeding, the county remains
15 responsible for paying the court-appointed professional's fees.
16 7. Finally, Part D of the bill establishes the Commission to Evaluate the Incorporation
17 of the Probate Court into the Judicial Branch, a 15-member study group composed of the
18 same categories of members appointed to the Commission To Create a Plan To Incorporate
19 the Probate Courts into the Judicial Branch. Part D of the bill directs the new commission
20 to conduct a thorough review of the new state Probate Court system in 2031, which must
21 include, but is not limited to, evaluating whether the number of supported state Probate
22 Court Judge positions proposed is appropriate or should be adjusted; whether the
23 jurisdiction of the state Probate Court, District Court and Superior Court should be adjusted
24 to increase judicial efficiency and access to justice; whether to authorize assignment of
25 state Probate Court Judges to preside over District Court or Superior Court dockets to the
26 same extent that the judges in the District Court and justices in the Superior Court are
27 available for cross assignments; whether additional investments should be made to enhance
28 the compatibility of the Probate Court and judicial branch electronic case management
29 systems; and whether additional opportunities exist to advance toward the ultimate goal of
30 fully incorporating the Probate Court system into the judicial branch. No later than
31 December 31, 2031, the commission is required to submit a report that includes its findings
32 and recommendations, which may include suggested legislation, for presentation to the
33 joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary matters. The
34 joint standing committee may report out legislation related to the report to the 135th
35 Legislature.
