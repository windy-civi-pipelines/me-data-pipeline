1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, Maine is experiencing significant challenges in providing timely services
4 to children with behavioral health challenges; and
5 Whereas, services for children with severe behavioral health challenges are especially
6 scarce; and
7 Whereas, assertive community treatment is an evidence-based intervention effective
8 at keeping people with severe behavioral health challenges in the community setting and
9 out of institutional settings; and
10 Whereas, Maine currently has only one child assertive community treatment team in
11 the State; and
12 Whereas, this legislation needs to take effect as soon as possible in order to develop
13 the 2 pilot programs required by this legislation that address the scarcity of child assertive
14 community treatment teams and provide timely services to children with behavioral health
15 challenges; and
16 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
17 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
18 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
19 therefore, be it
