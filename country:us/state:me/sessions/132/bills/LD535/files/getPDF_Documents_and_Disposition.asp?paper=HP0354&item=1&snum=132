15 period beyond the juvenile's 21st birthday, the court shall consider the following factors:

24 behavior;
25 E. Statements or evidence regarding the harm or trauma experienced by the victims
26 and the community's interest in justice and safety; and

39 initiated by the juvenile, the Department of Health and Human Services or the Department
40 of Corrections shall provide information including, but not limited to, the information in

Page 1 - 132LR0378(01)
413 dispositions otherwise provided in section 3314; section 3316, subsection 2-A; and Title
424 34‑A, section 3805, subsection 2. When reviewing a commitment to the Department of
435 Health and Human Services, the court shall consider efforts made by the Department of
446 Corrections and the Department of Health and Human Services to reunify the juvenile with
457 the juvenile's parents or custodians, shall make a finding regarding those efforts and shall
468 return custody of the juvenile to a parent or legal custodian if the return of the juvenile is
479 not contrary to the welfare of the juvenile. A petition for judicial review of a disposition
580 committing the juvenile to the Department of Health and Human Services must be served
591 on the parents at least 7 days prior to the hearing. Absent extraordinary circumstances, the
1502 juvenile may file a petition no more than once every 180 days. A juvenile who has not
1513 attained 21 years of age must be represented by counsel at this review.
12 Sec. 4. 15 MRSA §3319, as amended by PL 2005, c. 507, §13, is further amended
13 to read:
14 §3319. Designation of facility
15 Immediately after the court orders detention or confinement in or commitment to a
16 juvenile facility, the court shall notify the Commissioner of Corrections or the
17 commissioner's designee and shall inquire as to the juvenile facility to which the juvenile
18 will be transported. The commissioner has complete discretion to make this determination.
19 The commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall immediately inform the court of
20 the location of the juvenile facility to which the juvenile will be transported. If the juvenile
21 has been committed to a Department of Corrections juvenile correctional facility beyond
22 the juvenile's 21st birthday under section 3316, subsection 2-A, the commissioner shall
23 direct the transfer of the juvenile to an adult correctional facility.
24 SUMMARY
2255 This bill allows a court to impose a sentence that includes commitment beyond 21 years
2266 of age for a juvenile adjudicated of murder or a Class A crime. The bill requires the court
2277 to weigh a number of factors in determining whether to sentence a juvenile beyond the
2288 juvenile's 21st birthday, including the severity and the circumstances of the offense, the age
2299 and maturity of the juvenile, the rehabilitation potential of the juvenile, prior criminal
3300 history, the impact on the victim and the victim's community and findings from
3311 psychological assessments. The bill requires that a juvenile be represented by counsel at
3322 periodic reviews regardless of age. The bill also directs the Commissioner of Corrections
3333 to transfer the juvenile to an adult correctional facility at 21 years of age.
