Resolve, Directing the Secretary of State to Develop Recommendations for a
Multiyear Registration System for National Car Rental Companies
Preamble. Whereas, a multiyear registration system simplifies the registration,
renewal and management process for entities that own and rent large numbers of motor
vehicles; and
Whereas, the Secretary of State previously developed and implemented a successful
long-term registration program for trailers and semitrailers nationwide pursuant to the
Maine Revised Statutes, Title 29-A, section 512 that has generated significant income for
the State; and
Whereas, other states have implemented a multiyear registration system for motor
vehicles that has simplified the registration and management of motor vehicle rentals for
national car rental companies in those states and in turn has generated funds in registration
fees and excise taxes; now, therefore, be it
Sec. 1. Recommendations for multiyear registration system. Resolved: That
the Department of the Secretary of State, Bureau of Motor Vehicles, with input from the
Department of Public Safety, Bureau of State Police, shall consider and develop
recommendations on how to implement a multiyear registration and inspection program
for national car rental companies in the State.
Sec. 2. Submission of report. Resolved: That the Secretary of State shall submit
a report detailing how a multiyear registration and inspection program for national car
rental companies may be implemented in the State pursuant to section 1 along with
legislation necessary to accomplish the objectives outlined in the report to the Joint
Standing Committee on Transportation by December 3, 2025. The Joint Standing
Committee on Transportation may report out legislation based on the report to the Second
Regular Session of the 132nd Legislature.
