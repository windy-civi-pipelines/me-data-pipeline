21 safety of vehicles already allowed on the State's roads and highways, including antique
22 vehicles and motorcycles;
23 2. Review and analyze laws in other states that allow the use of small lightweight
24 vehicles and how the allowance of these vehicles has affected motor vehicle safety in those
25 states;

27 the subjects of study described in section 1 and how the results of those reports or studies
28 could relate to the State's roads and highways and motor vehicle systems;
29 4. Consider the most effective way to allow for small lightweight vehicles to be used
30 on the State's roads and highways while protecting the safety of those driving them and
31 other drivers and consider any restrictions on location, annual mileage or driving speed and
32 how to most effectively register those vehicles to indicate such restrictions, including
33 through the use of a system similar to those systems used for antique and farm vehicles;
34 5. Consider how to implement an inspection system that would ensure that small
35 lightweight vehicles are safe to drive on the State's roads and highways and how such a
36 system might be similar to or different from the State's current inspection systems for motor
37 vehicles and antique vehicles;
38 6. Recommend whether to implement the registration, inspection and use of small
39 lightweight vehicles on the State's roads and highways and recommend any related
40 legislation;

15 Regular Session of the 132nd Legislature based on the recommendations in the report.
16 SUMMARY
1177 This resolve directs the Secretary of State to convene a working group to study the
1188 potential to allow registration and use by motorists of small lightweight vehicles, including
1199 mini trucks, on the State's roads and highways, to review the systems and laws in place for
2200 antique vehicles and to study improving road safety generally. The Secretary of State is
