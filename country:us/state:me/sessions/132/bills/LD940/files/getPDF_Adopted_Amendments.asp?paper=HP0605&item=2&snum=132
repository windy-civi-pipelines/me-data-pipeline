2266 This amendment replaces the bill and changes the title. Current law provides that the
2277 Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife must, by rule, fix the maximum total value
2288 of prizes that may be awarded at fishing derbies in the State, except that for a derby on
2299 Sebago Lake in Cumberland County the maximum total value of prizes may not exceed
3300 $100,000. The amendment adds the Long Lake Ice Fishing Derby held in northern
3311 Aroostook County to this exception so that 2 derbies in the State, the derby held on Sebago
3322 Lake and the Long Lake Ice Fishing Derby, may each have a maximum total value of prizes
3333 up to $100,000. The amendment maintains language that states that derbies must be
3344 conducted in conjunction with the department's fisheries management objectives.
