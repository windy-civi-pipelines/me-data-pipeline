18 Sec. 2. 22 MRSA ยง1817, as repealed and replaced by PL 2007, c. 324, ยง4, is

20 ยง1817. Issuance of licenses
21 The department is authorized to issue licenses to operate hospitals, sanatoriums,
22 convalescent homes, rest homes, nursing homes, ambulatory surgical facilities and other
23 related institutions that, after inspection, are found to comply with this chapter, chapter
24 404-A and any rules adopted by the department. An initial license may be issued for up to
25 12 months. A license may be renewed for up to 24 months. The fee for this temporary or
26 conditional license is $15 and is payable at the time of issuance of the license regardless of
27 the term. When an institution, upon inspection by the department, is found not to meet all
28 requirements of this chapter or department rules, the department is authorized to issue
29 either:
30 1. Temporary license. A temporary license for a specified period not to exceed 90
31 days, during which time corrections specified by the department must be made by the
32 institution for compliance with this chapter, chapter 404-A and departmental rules, if in the
33 judgment of the commissioner the best interests of the public will be so served; or
34 2. Conditional license. A conditional license setting forth conditions that must be
35 met by the institution to the satisfaction of the department.
36 Failure of the institution to meet any of the department's conditions immediately voids
37 the temporary or conditional license by written notice by the department to the licensee or,
38 if the licensee cannot be reached for personal service, by notice left at the licensed premises.
39 A new application for a regular license may be considered by the department if, when and
40 after the conditions set forth by the department at the time of the issuance of this temporary
41 or conditional license have been met and satisfactory evidence of this fact has been
42 furnished to the department. The department may amend, modify or refuse to renew a
43 license in conformity with the Maine Administrative Procedure Act, or file a complaint
Page 14 - 132LR1940(01)

414 with the District Court requesting suspension or revocation of any license on any of the
425 following grounds: violation of this chapter or the rules issued adopted pursuant to this
436 chapter; violation of chapter 404-A or the rules adopted by the department pursuant to
447 chapter 404-A; permitting, aiding or abetting the commission of any illegal act in that
458 institution; or conduct of practices detrimental to the welfare of a patient. Whenever, on
469 inspection by the department, conditions are found to exist that violate this chapter or
570 department rules issued adopted pursuant to this chapter or violate chapter 404-A or the
581 rules adopted by the department pursuant to chapter 404-A that, in the opinion of the
592 commissioner, immediately endanger the health or safety of patients in an institution or
1503 create an emergency, the department by its duly authorized agents may, under the
1514 emergency provisions of Title 4, section 184, subsection 6, request that the District Court
1525 suspend or revoke the license. Rules adopted pursuant to this section are routine technical
1536 rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
14 SUMMARY
1155 This bill establishes the Maine Quality Care Act to ensure adequate direct care
1166 registered nurse staffing assignments in health care facilities, including hospitals,
1177 freestanding emergency departments and ambulatory surgical facilities, and critical access
1188 hospitals to provide safe and effective patient care. It establishes minimum staffing
1199 requirements for direct care registered nurses based on patient care unit and patient needs,
2200 specifies the method to calculate a health care facility's compliance with the staffing
2211 requirements, protects direct care registered nurses from retaliation and includes notice,
2222 record-keeping and enforcement requirements. The bill also directs the Department of
2233 Health and Human Services to establish a process for critical access hospitals to request
2244 flexibility regarding the minimum staffing requirements.
