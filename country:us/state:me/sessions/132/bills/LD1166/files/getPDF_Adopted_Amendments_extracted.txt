1155 changes to the bill to ensure that those licensed as physician assistants before the effective
1166 date of this legislation are not required to become relicensed with the title of physician
1177 associate until the time for renewal of their license. The amendment also clarifies that
1188 statutory revisions to amend the term "physician assistant" to "physician associate" do not
1199 apply to the Physician Assistants Licensure Compact.
