2 Sec. 1. 22 MRSA §3197 is enacted to read:
3 §3197. Nonemergency transportation reporting and quality assurance
4 1. Definitions. As used in this section, section 3198 and section 3199, unless the
5 context otherwise indicates, the following terms have the following meanings.
6 A. "Broker" means an entity with which the department has contracted to manage,
7 authorize, coordinate and reimburse the provision of necessary nonemergency
8 transportation for eligible MaineCare members.
9 B. "Nonemergency transportation" means transportation services provided to
10 MaineCare members through one of the state-designated transportation brokers to
11 allow members to access nonemergency MaineCare-covered services.
12 C. "Transporter" means any entity, organization or individual that provides
13 transportation services reimbursable by a broker under the nonemergency
14 transportation program. This includes agents of the broker with which the broker has
15 entered a service agreement, public transportation, commercial taxis, volunteers and
16 friends and family.
17 2. Nonemergency transportation dashboard. The department shall post on a publicly
18 accessible website information relating to broker performance indicators and results. The
19 department shall post the following on a quarterly basis, and no later than 45 days following
20 the close of a fiscal quarter:
21 A. Broker contact information; and
22 B. Audited data from at least the 2 prior calendar years, including:
23 (1) The total number of trips by month and region;
24 (2) The number of trips sortable by mode of transportation, broker, month and year.
25 Mode of transportation must include trips by agency providers; trips by
26 commercial providers, volunteer drivers, contract taxis, ad hoc taxis and specialty
27 transit; trips in which the driver is the member or close associate; public transit;
28 and broker-provided trips;
29 (3) The total number of trips by trip destination;
30 (4) The number of complaints, categorized by type and sortable by month and

38 100 trips delivered;

6 being transported is a child under 16 years of age or is receiving services under
7 a home and community-based services waiver, the timeliness standard is 95%
8 of all trips delivered. A trip is considered on time if the driver arrives from 30

11 time at the MaineCare-covered service location and until 30 minutes after the

14 member arrives within the window of the clinic's operating hours and no later
15 than 30 minutes prior to the clinic's closing time for the day. Trips by members
16 using the mileage reimbursement option or public transit are considered on
17 time for all trips for the purpose of date reporting. Trips by facilities under
18 contract with the broker to provide transportation for their members are
19 considered on time for all trips for the purpose of data reporting.

21 incidents and issue a monthly report with the following:
22 A. Incidents requiring immediate attention, including any incident involving injury
23 requiring medical care or emergency services; accidents resulting in injury or death;

34 member hygiene concerns; and vehicles or drivers incompatible with member needs.

39 the Legislature on state programs, rules, policies and laws;
40 G. Determine what types of complaints and inquiries are accepted for action by the
41 program and adopt procedures regarding communication with MaineCare members
42 making inquiries or complaints to the department;
Page 4 - 132LR0575(01)

1 H. Apply for and use grants, gifts and funds for the purpose of performing the duties
2 of the program; and
3 I. Collect and analyze records and data relevant to the duties and activities of the
4 program and make reports as required by law or as the department considers
5 appropriate.
6 4. Confidentiality of records. Information held by or records or case-specific reports
7 maintained by the program are confidential. Disclosure may be made only if the
8 ombudsman determines such disclosure is lawful and in the best interest of the MaineCare
9 member who is the subject of the records. The awarded contractor shall enter into a
10 business associate agreement with the department. The program may not make public the
11 identity of any individual requesting assistance from the program or make public any
12 protected health information in the conduct of its duties.
13 5. Liability. Any person who in good faith submits a complaint or inquiry to the
14 program pursuant to this section is immune from any civil or criminal liability for that act.
15 For the purpose of any civil or criminal proceedings, there is a rebuttable presumption that
16 any person acting pursuant to this section did so in good faith. The ombudsman and
17 employees and volunteers in the program are deemed employees of the State for the
18 purposes of the Maine Tort Claims Act.
19 6. Report. The program shall provide a report by December 31, 2025 and annually
20 thereafter concurrently to the department and to the joint standing committee of the
