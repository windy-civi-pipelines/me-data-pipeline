rights of the people; and
WHEREAS, a variety of important movements have arisen within the legislatures of the
several states to address a wide variety of concerns that may be appropriately addressed within
the context of Article V of the United States Constitution; and
WHEREAS, the Legislature of Maine wishes to address these various approaches in a

legislatures of three-fourths of the several states, or by conventions in three-fourths thereof, as

elections and governance to ensure transparency, prevent corruption, protect against the buying
of access to or influence over representatives and overturn the decision of the United States
Supreme Court in the case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission and related cases,
