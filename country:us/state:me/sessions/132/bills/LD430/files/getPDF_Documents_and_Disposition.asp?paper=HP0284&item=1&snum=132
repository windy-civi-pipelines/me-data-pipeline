1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, hydropower dams on Maine rivers generate significant quantities of
4 renewable energy, contribute critical tax revenue and other economic benefits to
5 surrounding communities and support local employment, both directly and indirectly; and
6 Whereas, historical water levels and water flows supported by hydropower and
7 nonhydropower dams on Maine rivers are relied upon by certain mills and other river-
8 adjacent businesses for their operations, as well as by upstream and downstream property
9 owners and others for water-dependent public and private recreational uses; and
10 Whereas, the removal of hydropower dams will result in a loss of renewable energy
11 generation capacity and local tax revenue, economic benefits and employment, and the
12 removal of both hydropower and nonhydropower dams will result in a significant reduction
13 in water levels in previously dammed rivers and lakes that may impair or prevent the
14 continued operation of mills and businesses that are dependent on water access and use,
15 may reduce surrounding property values and may threaten water-dependent public and
16 private recreational uses; and
17 Whereas, given recent developments regarding the future of certain hydropower and
18 nonhydropower dams in the State, the moratoria on dam removal and water release
19 provided in this legislation must take effect immediately to ensure full consideration of the
20 associated implications of removal of, or water release from, any dam; and
21 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
22 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
23 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
24 therefore,
25 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
26 Sec. 1. 38 MRSA §634, sub-§5 is enacted to read:
27 5. Dam removal; moratorium. Notwithstanding subsection 4 or any other provision
28 of this subarticle to the contrary, the department may not approve an application for a

30 This subsection is repealed January 1, 2027.
31 Sec. 2. 38 MRSA §902, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 1995, c. 630, §3, is amended to

36 with each person or group of persons, the owner shall explain the process set forth in this
37 article and shall inform the person or group that the department may issue an order
38 requiring release of the water impounded by the dam if a new owner is not located. A dam
39 owner may meet the obligation to consult with property owners by holding a public meeting
40 and consulting with the persons who appear at that meeting, as long as notice has been sent
41 to each property owner as required in section 901.
