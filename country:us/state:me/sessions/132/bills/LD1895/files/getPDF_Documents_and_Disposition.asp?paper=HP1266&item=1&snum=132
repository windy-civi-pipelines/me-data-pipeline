1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 36 MRSA ยง943, as amended by PL 2023, c. 523, Pt. A, ยง7 and c. 640, ยง2, is
3 further amended by enacting after the 3rd paragraph a new paragraph to read:
4 If the party named on the tax lien mortgage has sold or otherwise conveyed the property
5 to another person and provides proof of payment of that party's pro rata share of taxes due,
6 the municipal treasurer or assignee of record shall prepare and record a discharge of the tax
7 lien mortgage against that party in the same manner as is now provided for the discharge
8 of real estate mortgages, except that a facsimile signature of the treasurer or treasurer's
9 assignee may be used. The discharge under this paragraph is only for the seller.
10 SUMMARY
1111 This bill addresses the situation when, following the sale or other conveyance of real
1122 estate, a tax lien is placed on the real estate in the name of the seller. This bill requires the
1133 municipal treasurer to prepare and record a discharge of the tax lien against the seller if the
1144 seller provides proof of payment of the seller's pro rata share of all taxes owed by the seller.
1155 The discharge is only for the seller; the lien remains against the real estate.
