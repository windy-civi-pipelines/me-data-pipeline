31 1. Program established. The Maine Offshore Wind Renewable Energy and
32 Economic Development Program, referred to in this section as "the program," is established
33 to further the development and use of offshore wind power projects in the Gulf of Maine.
34 The office, in collaboration with the commission, shall administer the program in
35 accordance with this section and shall ensure that the program is designed to advance the
36 greenhouse gas emissions reduction obligations and climate policies of this State under
37 Title 38, section 576‑A and Title 38, section 577, the renewable energy goals established
38 in section 3210, subsection 1‑A and all applicable workforce development efforts of this
39 State. Under the program, the office, in collaboration with the commission, shall:
40 A. Encourage the responsible development of offshore wind power projects to stabilize
41 energy supply prices, reduce this State's reliance on imported fossil fuels, realize direct
42 and near-term economic benefits for the people of this State and ensure the

413 achievement of this State's wind energy generation goal established in section 3404,
424 subsection 2;
3 B. Support offshore wind power projects that result in long-term, family-supporting
4 careers, including for disadvantaged populations and communities;
5 C. Support responsibly sited and operated offshore wind power projects that avoid or
6 minimize and compensate for impacts to wildlife, habitat, fisheries and coastal
7 communities in the Gulf of Maine;
8 D. Support efforts to increase understanding of impacts of offshore wind power
9 projects on the marine environment and to advance research to better understand how
10 offshore wind power projects can coexist with minimal impact to existing ocean users,
11 wildlife, fisheries and the marine environment;
12 E. Promote diversity, equity and inclusion in the development of offshore wind power
13 projects with particular consideration given to the energy and economic circumstances
14 and opportunities in coastal and socially vulnerable communities and for the federally
15 recognized Indian tribes in this State. For the purposes of this paragraph, "socially
16 vulnerable communities" means those communities containing populations that are
17 disproportionately burdened by existing social inequities or lack the capacity to
18 withstand new or worsening burdens;
19 F. Support the advancement of port infrastructure, local offshore wind power-related
20 economic development and the development of a supply chain to support the
21 development of offshore wind power projects;
22 G. Support the development and deployment of innovative technologies to achieve the
23 energy policy and economic development objectives of this State, including energy
24 storage;
25 H. Support the use of Maine-based technical and engineering expertise and build on
26 this State's leadership in offshore wind power, maritime industries and research and
27 development;
28 I. Support the development of transmission infrastructure necessary for this State to
29 expeditiously meet its renewable energy and climate goals, including advancing the
30 development of shared or regional offshore wind power transmission infrastructure;
31 J. Collaborate with other states or entities when appropriate on regional issues,
32 including, but not limited to, transmission, procurement, supply chain and workforce
33 development and research and monitoring relating to wildlife, fisheries and the Gulf of
34 Maine ecosystem;
35 K. Support responsibly sited offshore wind power projects with generation facilities
36 located in areas outside of the area of the Gulf of Maine where the majority of lobster
37 fishing or other significant commercial fishing occurs;
38 L. Coordinate the activities of state agencies that are affected by the development of
39 offshore wind power projects, including, but not limited to, the Department of
40 Economic and Community Development, the Department of Labor, the Department of
41 Marine Resources, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Inland
42 Fisheries and Wildlife and the Department of Environmental Protection; and

1 M. Support the development of deep-water offshore wind power projects and
2 transmission infrastructure in the Gulf of Maine that serve the public interest by
3 advancing the renewable energy and climate policies and economic development goals
4 of this State and helping to reduce energy price volatility.
5 Sec. 6. 35-A MRSA §3409, sub-§1, ¶A, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 481, §7, is
6 amended by amending subparagraph (3) to read:
