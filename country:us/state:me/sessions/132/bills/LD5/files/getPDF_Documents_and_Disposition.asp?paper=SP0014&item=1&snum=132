1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, Public Law 2023, chapter 591 prohibits a health insurance carrier from
4 requiring an air ambulance service provider to obtain prior authorization before
5 transporting an enrollee to a hospital or between hospitals for urgent care; and
6 Whereas, the Legislature intended to limit the application of that provision to air
7 ambulance service providers that are nonprofit organizations; and
8 Whereas, the language clarifying that the provision applied to air ambulance service
9 providers that are nonprofit organizations was inadvertently omitted from Public Law
10 2023, chapter 591; and
11 Whereas, this legislation corrects that omission and must take effect as soon as
12 possible in order to effectuate the Legislature's intent; and
13 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
14 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
15 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
16 therefore,
17 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
