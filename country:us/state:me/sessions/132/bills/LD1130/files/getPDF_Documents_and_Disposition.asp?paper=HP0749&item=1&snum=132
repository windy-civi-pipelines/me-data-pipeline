1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 35-A MRSA §3145, as amended by PL 2023, c. 374, §1, is further amended
3 to read:
4 §3145. State energy storage policy goals
5 The state goal for energy storage system development is at least 300 megawatts of
6 installed capacity located within the State by December 31, 2025 and at least 400
7 megawatts of installed capacity located within the State by December 31, 2030 and,
8 additionally, at least 300 megawatts of long-duration battery storage within the State by
9 December 31, 2035. Beginning January 1, 2024, and every 2 years thereafter, the
10 Governor's Energy Office established in Title 2, section 9 may reevaluate and increase the
11 state goal for energy storage system development and report that goal to the joint standing
12 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy and utilities matters. For the
13 purposes of this section, "energy storage system" has the same meaning as in section 3481,
14 subsection 6 and "long-duration battery storage" means energy storage using a
15 commercially available battery technology capable of storing energy for 8 hours or more
16 for use at a later time.
17 SUMMARY
1188 This bill amends the law governing the State's energy storage goals by establishing an
1199 additional goal of developing at least 300 megawatts of long-duration battery storage
2200 within the State by December 31, 2035.
