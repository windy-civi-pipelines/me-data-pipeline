13 an applicant must also pay a nationwide mortgage licensing system and registry
14 processing fee in an amount to be determined by the administrators of the nationwide
15 mortgage licensing system and registry. Reregistration applications received after the
16 due date are subject to an additional fee of $100;
17 C. The setting or resetting as necessary of reregistration or reporting dates; and
18 D. Other requirements for application for, amendment of or revocation of a registration

21 action on an application within 30 days after the administrator has accepted the application
22 as complete. Upon written request, the applicant is entitled to a hearing on the question of
23 the applicant's qualifications for registration or reregistration if the administrator has
24 notified the applicant in writing that the application has been denied or the administrator
25 has not issued a registration or reregistration within 30 days after the application for the
26 registration or reregistration was accepted as complete by the administrator. A request for
27 a hearing may not be made more than 60 days after the application was accepted as
28 complete or the administrator has mailed a written notice to the applicant stating that the
29 application has been denied and stating the reasons for the denial of the application.
30 Rules adopted pursuant to this section are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5,
31 chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.

33 Each application for a registration or reregistration under this chapter must be
34 accompanied by evidence of a surety bond in a form approved by the administrator in the
35 aggregate amount of $50,000 and designate the administrator as payee for use by the
36 administrator and any person or persons who may have a cause of action against an earned
37 wage access services provider. The terms of the bond must run concurrently with the period
38 of time during which the registration or reregistration is in effect.
