1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, individuals in probate court proceedings involving adult guardianship,
4 conservatorship and special arrangements have acute issues that need addressing; and
5 Whereas, state agencies and hospitals have limited ability to address these issues due
6 to the inability to access confidential information and records involved in the proceedings;

9 individuals and public interest may suffer harm or other adverse consequences; and
