An Act Allowing Access by State Agencies and Hospitals to Certain
Confidential Probate Court Records
Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, individuals in probate court proceedings involving adult guardianship,
conservatorship and special arrangements have acute issues that need addressing; and
Whereas, state agencies and hospitals have limited ability to address these issues due
to the inability to access confidential information and records involved in the proceedings;
and
Whereas, the public interest requires prompt attention to these issues or the
individuals and public interest may suffer harm or other adverse consequences; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore,
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
Sec. 1. 18-C MRSA §5-205, sub-§11 is enacted to read:
