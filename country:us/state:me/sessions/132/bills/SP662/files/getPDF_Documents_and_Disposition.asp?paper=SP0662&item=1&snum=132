JOINT RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING ACCESS TO JUSTICE DAY
PRESENTED BY MAINE'S JUSTICE ACTION GROUP
WHEREAS, the year 2025 marks the 30th anniversary of Maine's Justice Action Group,
a judge-led coalition of leaders from Maine's legal community who are passionate about
helping all Maine people have access to civil justice; and
WHEREAS, the coalition members include representatives of the state and federal
judiciary, the Legislature, nonprofit civil legal aid providers, the University of Maine School
of Law, the Maine Justice Foundation, the Maine State Bar Association, the Maine Trial
Lawyers Association, private practice attorneys and others; and
WHEREAS, key initiator Judge Frank Coffin described the Justice Action Group as a
catalyst, something introduced in small quantities that produces great change, and the Justice
Action Group has been an advocate for equal access to justice since 1995; and
WHEREAS, equal access to justice is a bedrock principle of a free, constitutional society,
and no system of laws and constitutional protections can be effective if only those who can
afford private advocates have access to justice; and
WHEREAS, because justice for all is achievable only through the vigilance and action of
the legislative, judicial and executive branches of government, it is important to provide for
access to justice in all branches of State Government; and
WHEREAS, providing equal access to justice has tangible, widespread benefits for
Maine's families, children, schools, communities, businesses, charities, government and
economy; and
WHEREAS, legal issues profoundly affect basic human needs such as safety from
violence and exploitation, security and stability for children and the families in which they are
nurtured, health, shelter and food security; and
WHEREAS, the need for increased support for civil legal aid and pro bono representation
for low-income and vulnerable Maine people remains acute; now, therefore, be it
RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Thirty-second Legislature
now assembled in the First Special Session, on behalf of the people we represent, pause to
declare April 17, 2025 as Access to Justice Day and to acknowledge and express our
appreciation and strong support for Maine's civil legal aid providers and private practice
attorneys who provide pro bono services for those otherwise unable to afford legal
representation; and be it further
RESOLVED: That a suitable copy of this resolution, duly authenticated by the Secretary
of State, be transmitted to the Justice Action Group.
