11 SUMMARY
1122 This bill amends eligibility criteria for the Maine Farms for the Future Program to
1133 ensure that farmers who lease rather than own land and those who farm on land that is
1144 already protected by an agricultural conservation agreement are able to receive grants in
1155 the program. The bill also allows the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry
1166 to grant exceptions to eligibility criteria to allow for more flexibility for business plan
1177 development and investment support for farms. Lastly, the bill increases the maximum
1188 allowable amounts for grants and agricultural marketing loans awarded through the
