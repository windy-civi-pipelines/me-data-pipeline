1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 12 MRSA §6072, sub-§1-B is enacted to read:
3 1-B. Definitions. As used in this section and section 6072-A, unless the context
4 otherwise indicates, the following terms have the following meanings.
5 A. "Bottom operations" means an operational type that primarily involves:
6 (1) The deposit of the principal aquaculture gear on the ocean bottom. The
7 principal aquaculture gear for bottom operations includes, but is not limited to,
8 shellfish cages, bags or netting designed to contain or protect shellfish from
9 predation; or
10 (2) The deposit of marine organisms to be cultured directly on the ocean bottom
11 without the use of aquaculture gear, other than netting to protect the organisms
12 from predation, including, but not limited to, direct deposit of shellfish seed on the
13 ocean bottom.
14 B. "Operational type" means, with respect to an aquaculture operation conducted
15 pursuant to a lease issued under this section or section 6072-A, the method by which
16 the aquaculture operation engages in aquaculture. An aquaculture operation may have
17 only one operational type. "Operational type" includes bottom operations, submerged
18 operations or surface operations.
19 C. "Principal aquaculture gear" means the gear or equipment primarily used to engage
20 in aquaculture by an aquaculture operation conducted pursuant to a lease issued under
21 this section or section 6072-A. "Principal aquaculture gear" does not include marker
22 buoys or mobile vessels used for transit to and from the lease site.
23 D. "Submerged operations" means an operational type that primarily involves the
24 suspension of the principal aquaculture gear below the ocean surface where that gear
25 is not connected to a major floating structure on the ocean surface and does not come
26 in contact with the ocean bottom. The principal aquaculture gear for submerged
27 operations, which may be connected to surface buoys in a manner designed to maintain
28 the position of the gear in the water column and above the ocean bottom, includes, but
29 is not limited to, seaweed or shellfish longlines, shellfish cages, shellfish lantern nets
30 or pearl nets, scallop gear, hanging lines or shellfish spat collectors.
31 E. "Surface operations" means an operational type that primarily involves the principal
32 aquaculture gear floating on the ocean surface or suspended from the surface and
33 connected to a major floating structure on the ocean surface, such as a raft or work
34 float, in a manner that provides easy access to the marine organisms cultured,
35 regardless of whether such aquaculture gear is seasonally deposited on the ocean
36 bottom to avoid winter storms or icing. The principal aquaculture gear for surface
37 operations includes, but is not limited to, mussel rafts, shellfish bags or cages or
38 floating upweller systems.
39 Sec. 2. 12 MRSA §6072, sub-§4, ¶H, as enacted by PL 1987, c. 453, §1, is

469 by a 3rd-party entity selected by the department;
7 Sec. 3. 12 MRSA §6072, sub-§5-A, as amended by PL 2003, c. 660, Pt. A, §5, is
8 further amended to read:
9 5-A. Department site review. Prior to the lease hearing, the department shall conduct
10 an assessment of the proposed site and surrounding area to determine the possible effects
11 of the lease on commercially and ecologically significant flora and fauna and conflicts with
12 traditional fisheries and all other uses. If the department requires a video recording of the
13 site or other information collected through a site dive as part of the assessment under this
14 subsection and the applicant is required to pay the cost associated with the site dive, the
15 department shall allow the applicant to contract with any qualified 3rd-party entity to
16 conduct the site dive and may not require the site dive to be conducted by a 3rd-party entity
17 selected by the department. This information The information from the assessment must be
18 provided to the intervenors and made available to the public 30 days before the hearing. As
19 part of the site review, the department shall request information from the municipal harbor
20 master about designated or traditional storm anchorages in proximity to the proposed lease.
21 The commissioner may by rule establish levels of assessment appropriate to the scale or
22 potential environmental risk posed by a proposed lease activity. The rules must provide a
23 method of establishing a baseline to monitor the environmental effects of a lease activity.
24 Rules adopted under this subsection are major substantive rules as defined by Title 5,
25 chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.
