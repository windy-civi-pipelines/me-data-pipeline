33 under this chapter.

35 for a tax year under this chapter, after subtracting allowable credits for that tax year.

15 adequate record the actual distribution of tax liability and allowable credits, or both, in
16 which case the amount of the installment payments must be adjusted accordingly and be
17 determined in accordance with the portion of the taxpayer's estimated tax liability
18 applicable to that portion of the taxpayer's tax year, completed by the close of the month

20 year.

25 installment amount pursuant to subsection 4 for the period of underpayment at the interest
26 rate provided pursuant to section 186. For cause, the assessor may waive or abate all or any

9 affecting the taxpayer's liability under this chapter.
10 B. The amended Maine return required pursuant to paragraph A must be filed within
11 180 days from the final determination date of the change or correction or the filing of
12 the amended federal return. For purposes of this paragraph, "final determination date"

15 with respect to a taxable year for federal income tax purposes:
16 (1) The taxpayer has made payment of an additional income tax liability resulting
17 from a federal audit, the taxpayer has not filed a petition for redetermination or

32 Section 6225(c).
33 C. The amended Maine return filed pursuant to this subsection must indicate the
34 change or correction and the reason for that change or correction. The amended return
35 constitutes an admission as to the correctness of the change unless the taxpayer includes
36 with the return a written explanation of the reason the change or correction is erroneous.
37 If the taxpayer files an amended federal return, a copy of the amended federal return
38 must be attached to the amended Maine return under this chapter.
39 D. The assessor may require additional information to be filed with the amended Maine
40 return filed pursuant to this subsection. The assessor may prescribe exceptions to the

1 'Sec. 32. 36 MRSA §2857-A is enacted to read:
2 §2857-A. Accounting periods and methods of accounting
3 1. Accounting periods. The determination of a tax year is subject to the following.
4 A. If a taxpayer's tax year is changed for federal income tax purposes, the taxpayer's
5 tax year for purposes of the tax imposed by this chapter must be similarly changed.
6 B. Notwithstanding paragraph A and section 2855, subsection 15, if the assessor makes
7 a determination of jeopardy and terminates the taxpayer's reporting period under
8 section 145, the tax must be computed for the period determined by that action.
9 2. Method of accounting. The method of accounting used by a taxpayer is subject to
10 this subsection.
11 A. For purposes of the tax imposed by this chapter, a taxpayer's method of accounting
12 must be the same as the taxpayer's method of accounting for federal income tax
13 purposes. If a method of accounting has not been regularly used by the taxpayer, gross
14 income from mining for purposes of this chapter must be computed under a method
15 that in the opinion of the assessor fairly reflects gross proceeds.
16 B. If a taxpayer's method of accounting is changed for federal income tax purposes,
17 the taxpayer's method of accounting for purposes of this chapter must be similarly
18 changed.
19 C. In computing a taxpayer's gross proceeds for any tax year under a method of
20 accounting different from the method under which the taxpayer's gross proceeds for
21 the previous year were computed, there must be taken into account those adjustments
22 that are determined to be necessary solely by reason of the change in order to prevent
23 amounts from being duplicated or omitted.'
24 Amend the bill by inserting after section 32 the following:
25 'Sec. 33. 36 MRSA §2859, as repealed and replaced by PL 1985, c. 691, §§27 and
26 48, is repealed and the following enacted in its place:
27 §2859. Estimated tax requirements
28 1. Definitions. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the

30 A. "Allowable credits" means the total amount of payments by a taxpayer that have
31 been or will be paid to the bureau prior to the date the payment against which they are
32 to be used as a credit is due and that are available to offset any tax liability estimated
33 under this chapter.
34 B. "Estimated tax" means the total amount of tax that a person estimates will be due
35 for a tax year under this chapter, after subtracting allowable credits for that tax year.
36 C. "Period of underpayment" means the period of time from the date an estimated tax
37 installment is due until the underpayment is satisfied or until the tax return to which
38 the estimated tax installment applies is due, whichever is less.
39 2. Requirement to pay estimated tax. A person subject to taxation under this chapter
40 shall make payment of estimated tax as required by this chapter. The requirement to make
41 estimated tax payments is waived if:

3 B. The person had less than $1,000 tax liability under this chapter for the immediately

6 estimated tax under this chapter is liable for an estimated tax that is no less than the lesser
7 of:
8 A. An amount equal to the person's tax liability under this chapter for the immediately
9 preceding tax year, if that preceding year was a tax year of 12 months; and
10 B. An amount equal to 90% of the person's tax liability under this chapter for the
11 current tax year.
12 4. Amount of installment. The amount of estimated tax to be paid in a tax year by a
13 taxpayer is to be paid in installments by the dates established in this section. The amount
14 of the estimated tax is to be paid in 4 equal installments unless the taxpayer establishes by
15 adequate record the actual distribution of tax liability and allowable credits, or both, in
16 which case the amount of the installment payments must be adjusted accordingly and be
17 determined in accordance with the portion of the taxpayer's estimated tax liability
18 applicable to that portion of the taxpayer's tax year, completed by the close of the month
19 preceding the installment's due date, less estimated tax payments already made for the tax
20 year.
21 5. Due dates for estimated tax installments. An estimated tax installment payment
22 calculated pursuant to subsection 4 is due the 15th day of the 4th, 6th, 9th and 13th month
23 following the beginning of the taxpayer's tax year.
24 6. Penalty. A penalty accrues automatically on underpayments of the required
25 installment amount pursuant to subsection 4 for the period of underpayment at the interest
26 rate provided pursuant to section 186. For cause, the assessor may waive or abate all or any
27 part of the penalty.
28 7. Short taxable year. For a tax year of less than 12 months, the estimated tax must
29 be paid in full by the 15th day of the last month of the tax year. For payment dates falling
30 within the short taxable year, payment must be made as provided in subsection 5.
31 8. Installments paid in advance. At the taxpayer's election, an installment of
32 estimated tax required pursuant to subsection 4 may be paid prior to the date prescribed for
