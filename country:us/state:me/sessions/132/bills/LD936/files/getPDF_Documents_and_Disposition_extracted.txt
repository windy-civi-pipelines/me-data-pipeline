8 SUMMARY
99 In Resolve 2023, chapter 83, the Department of Administrative and Financial Services,
1100 Bureau of Revenue Services, Office of Tax Policy was required to review the State's
1111 taxation of metallic mineral mining and submit a report to the Joint Standing Committee
1122 on Taxation in the Second Regular Session of the 131st Legislature.
13 1. This bill implements the changes proposed in the legislation accompanying the
14 report, including providing for the refund of sales tax on depreciable machinery and
15 equipment purchases and also:
16 A. Exempting unextracted minerals from the property tax;
17 B. Simplifying the excise tax imposed on a mining company by establishing a formula
18 of the gross proceeds of that mining company multiplied by 0.05; repealing the
19 definition of "mineral products" and other definitions no longer needed; clarifying the
20 definition of "tax year" for purposes of the mining excise tax; incorporating various
21 administrative provisions; and eliminating credits for payment of certain property taxes
22 and prepayment of taxes; and
23 C. Eliminating the Mining Impact Assistance Fund and related provisions. The fund
24 is used to provide grants to municipalities, counties and the unorganized territory to
25 offset the loss of property tax revenue and to provide necessary new or additional
26 public facilities and services related to mining.
27 2. The bill also makes the following changes not included in the Office of Tax Policy's
28 original report:
29 A. It clarifies the imposition and calculation of the mining excise tax; and
30 B. It eliminates the Mining Oversight Fund and requires that, of the mining excise tax
31 revenue, 75% is deposited in the Mining Excise Tax Trust Fund and 25% is deposited
32 in the General Fund.

8 SUMMARY
99 In Resolve 2023, chapter 83, the Department of Administrative and Financial Services,
1100 Bureau of Revenue Services, Office of Tax Policy was required to review the State's
1111 taxation of metallic mineral mining and submit a report to the Joint Standing Committee
1122 on Taxation in the Second Regular Session of the 131st Legislature.
13 1. This bill implements the changes proposed in the legislation accompanying the
14 report, including providing for the refund of sales tax on depreciable machinery and
15 equipment purchases and also:
16 A. Exempting unextracted minerals from the property tax;
17 B. Simplifying the excise tax imposed on a mining company by establishing a formula
18 of the gross proceeds of that mining company multiplied by 0.05; repealing the
19 definition of "mineral products" and other definitions no longer needed; clarifying the
20 definition of "tax year" for purposes of the mining excise tax; incorporating various
21 administrative provisions; and eliminating credits for payment of certain property taxes
22 and prepayment of taxes; and
23 C. Eliminating the Mining Impact Assistance Fund and related provisions. The fund
24 is used to provide grants to municipalities, counties and the unorganized territory to
25 offset the loss of property tax revenue and to provide necessary new or additional
26 public facilities and services related to mining.
27 2. The bill also makes the following changes not included in the Office of Tax Policy's
28 original report:
29 A. It clarifies the imposition and calculation of the mining excise tax; and
30 B. It eliminates the Mining Oversight Fund and requires that, of the mining excise tax
31 revenue, 75% is deposited in the Mining Excise Tax Trust Fund and 25% is deposited
32 in the General Fund.
