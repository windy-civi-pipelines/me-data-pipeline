Page 6 - 132LR0027(03)
B. The estimated tax payments made; and

a reasonable manner between the proceeds derived from minerals mined in this State and
the proceeds derived from minerals mined in the other jurisdictions. The State Tax
Assessor assessor may distribute, apportion or allocate on a reasonable basis gross
proceeds, deductions, credits or allowances between or among mining companies or mine
sites mining properties, if such distribution, apportionment or allocation is necessary to
prevent evasion of taxes imposed by this chapter, or to reasonably reflect clearly the gross
or net proceeds of any mining company or mine site from mining activity in the State. For
purposes of this subsection, "mining property" has the same meaning as "property" as
defined in Section 614 of the Code.

Section 24:
6. Requirement to file amended Maine returns. The requirement to file an amended
Maine return is governed by this subsection.
A. A taxpayer shall file an amended Maine return as required by this subsection when

affecting the taxpayer's liability under this chapter.
B. The amended Maine return required pursuant to paragraph A must be filed within
180 days from the final determination date of the change or correction or the filing of
the amended federal return. For purposes of this paragraph, "final determination date"

Section 6225(c).
C. The amended Maine return filed pursuant to this subsection must indicate the
change or correction and the reason for that change or correction. The amended return
constitutes an admission as to the correctness of the change unless the taxpayer includes
with the return a written explanation of the reason the change or correction is erroneous.
If the taxpayer files an amended federal return, a copy of the amended federal return
must be attached to the amended Maine return under this chapter.
D. The assessor may require additional information to be filed with the amended Maine
return filed pursuant to this subsection. The assessor may prescribe exceptions to the
requirements of this subsection.

§2857-A. Accounting periods and methods of accounting

Section 27:
1. Accounting periods. The determination of a tax year is subject to the following.
A. If a taxpayer's tax year is changed for federal income tax purposes, the taxpayer's
tax year for purposes of the tax imposed by this chapter must be similarly changed.
B. Notwithstanding paragraph A and section 2855, subsection 15, if the assessor makes
a determination of jeopardy and terminates the taxpayer's reporting period under

Section 28:
section 145, the tax must be computed for the period determined by that action.

Section 29:
2. Method of accounting. The method of accounting used by a taxpayer is subject to
this subsection.
A. For purposes of the tax imposed by this chapter, a taxpayer's method of accounting

purposes. If a method of accounting has not been regularly used by the taxpayer, gross
Page 8 - 132LR0027(03)
income from mining for purposes of this chapter must be computed under a method
that in the opinion of the assessor fairly reflects gross proceeds.
B. If a taxpayer's method of accounting is changed for federal income tax purposes,
the taxpayer's method of accounting for purposes of this chapter must be similarly
changed.
C. In computing a taxpayer's gross proceeds for any tax year under a method of
accounting different from the method under which the taxpayer's gross proceeds for
the previous year were computed, there must be taken into account those adjustments
that are determined to be necessary solely by reason of the change in order to prevent
amounts from being duplicated or omitted.

Page 6 - 132LR0027(03)

B. The estimated tax payments made; and
C. Credits provided under section 2858; and

and credits, at the time its annual return is due without extensions.
4. Extensions. The State Tax Assessor assessor may grant a reasonable extension of
time for filing a return, declaration, statement or other document or payment of tax or
estimated tax required by this chapter on such terms and conditions as he the assessor may
require. The An extension for filing a return, declaration, statement or other document

other states or Canadian provinces, the gross proceeds must be allocated or apportioned in
a reasonable manner between the proceeds derived from minerals mined in this State and
the proceeds derived from minerals mined in the other jurisdictions. The State Tax
Assessor assessor may distribute, apportion or allocate on a reasonable basis gross
proceeds, deductions, credits or allowances between or among mining companies or mine
sites mining properties, if such distribution, apportionment or allocation is necessary to
prevent evasion of taxes imposed by this chapter, or to reasonably reflect clearly the gross
or net proceeds of any mining company or mine site from mining activity in the State. For
purposes of this subsection, "mining property" has the same meaning as "property" as
defined in Section 614 of the Code.
6. Requirement to file amended Maine returns. The requirement to file an amended
Maine return is governed by this subsection.
A. A taxpayer shall file an amended Maine return as required by this subsection when
the taxpayer files an amended federal return affecting the taxpayer's liability under this
chapter, the Internal Revenue Service changes or corrects any item affecting the
taxpayer's liability under this chapter or for any reason there is a change or correction
affecting the taxpayer's liability under this chapter.
B. The amended Maine return required pursuant to paragraph A must be filed within
180 days from the final determination date of the change or correction or the filing of
the amended federal return. For purposes of this paragraph, "final determination date"
means, when the taxpayer files an amended federal return affecting the taxpayer's
Page 7 - 132LR0027(03)

liability under this chapter, the date on which the earliest of the following events occurs
with respect to a taxable year for federal income tax purposes:
(1) The taxpayer has made payment of an additional income tax liability resulting

from a federal audit;
(3) The taxpayer signs federal Internal Revenue Service Form 870-AD or another
Internal Revenue Service form consenting to a deficiency or accepting an
overassessment;

Section 6225(c).
C. The amended Maine return filed pursuant to this subsection must indicate the
change or correction and the reason for that change or correction. The amended return
constitutes an admission as to the correctness of the change unless the taxpayer includes
with the return a written explanation of the reason the change or correction is erroneous.
If the taxpayer files an amended federal return, a copy of the amended federal return
must be attached to the amended Maine return under this chapter.
D. The assessor may require additional information to be filed with the amended Maine
return filed pursuant to this subsection. The assessor may prescribe exceptions to the
requirements of this subsection.
Sec. 35. 36 MRSA §2857-A is enacted to read:
§2857-A. Accounting periods and methods of accounting
1. Accounting periods. The determination of a tax year is subject to the following.
A. If a taxpayer's tax year is changed for federal income tax purposes, the taxpayer's
tax year for purposes of the tax imposed by this chapter must be similarly changed.
B. Notwithstanding paragraph A and section 2855, subsection 15, if the assessor makes
a determination of jeopardy and terminates the taxpayer's reporting period under
section 145, the tax must be computed for the period determined by that action.
2. Method of accounting. The method of accounting used by a taxpayer is subject to
this subsection.
A. For purposes of the tax imposed by this chapter, a taxpayer's method of accounting
must be the same as the taxpayer's method of accounting for federal income tax
purposes. If a method of accounting has not been regularly used by the taxpayer, gross
Page 8 - 132LR0027(03)

income from mining for purposes of this chapter must be computed under a method
that in the opinion of the assessor fairly reflects gross proceeds.
B. If a taxpayer's method of accounting is changed for federal income tax purposes,
the taxpayer's method of accounting for purposes of this chapter must be similarly
changed.
C. In computing a taxpayer's gross proceeds for any tax year under a method of
accounting different from the method under which the taxpayer's gross proceeds for
the previous year were computed, there must be taken into account those adjustments
that are determined to be necessary solely by reason of the change in order to prevent
amounts from being duplicated or omitted.

estimated tax under this chapter is liable for an estimated tax that is no less than the lesser
of:
A. An amount equal to the person's tax liability under this chapter for the immediately
preceding tax year, if that preceding year was a tax year of 12 months; and
B. An amount equal to 90% of the person's tax liability under this chapter for the
current tax year.
4. Amount of installment. The amount of estimated tax to be paid in a tax year by a
taxpayer is to be paid in installments by the dates established in this section. The amount

adequate record the actual distribution of tax liability and allowable credits, or both, in
which case the amount of the installment payments must be adjusted accordingly and be
determined in accordance with the portion of the taxpayer's estimated tax liability
applicable to that portion of the taxpayer's tax year, completed by the close of the month
preceding the installment's due date, less estimated tax payments already made for the tax
year.
5. Due dates for estimated tax installments. An estimated tax installment payment
calculated pursuant to subsection 4 is due the 15th day of the 4th, 6th, 9th and 13th month
following the beginning of the taxpayer's tax year.
6. Penalty. A penalty accrues automatically on underpayments of the required
installment amount pursuant to subsection 4 for the period of underpayment at the interest
rate provided pursuant to section 186. For cause, the assessor may waive or abate all or any
part of the penalty.
7. Short taxable year. For a tax year of less than 12 months, the estimated tax must
be paid in full by the 15th day of the last month of the tax year. For payment dates falling
within the short taxable year, payment must be made as provided in subsection 5.
8. Installments paid in advance. At the taxpayer's election, an installment of
estimated tax required pursuant to subsection 4 may be paid prior to the date prescribed for
its payment.
