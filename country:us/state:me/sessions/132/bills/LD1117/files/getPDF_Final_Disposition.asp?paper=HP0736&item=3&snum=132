required pursuant to section 3204, subsection 2. On January 15, 2026 and each January
15th thereafter, the minimum total package value amount under this paragraph must be

the level as of August of the year preceding that year in the Consumer Price Index for
Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, CPI-W, for the Northeast Region, or its
successor index, as published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of

employed in the field of their preapprenticeship after a period of 6 months following
successful completion of their certified preapprenticeship training program or are
represented by a labor organization are ineligible for grants under this subsection.
Funding for grants to support preapprenticeship training programs must be awarded to
certified preapprenticeship training programs with strong direct entry links with registered
apprenticeship programs through a competitive process administered by the department
through the Maine Apprenticeship Program and to certified preapprenticeship training
programs that train individuals for priority sectors for high-wage, in-demand jobs.
Funding for grants to support certified preapprenticeship training programs may also be
used for program development, support and staffing for grantees.
Sec. 2. Department of Labor; study. The Department of Labor shall, within
existing resources, conduct a study reviewing certified preapprenticeship training programs
and registered apprenticeship programs in the State and in other states. The study must
include an analysis of the programs reviewed, including but not limited to the funding
methods of the programs. The department shall invite relevant stakeholders to participate
in the study. The department shall report its findings, including any suggested legislation,
to the Joint Standing Committee on Labor by December 3, 2025. The joint standing
