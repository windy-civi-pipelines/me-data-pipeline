of-way for siting of electric transmission infrastructure in the State, including colocation
with transportation, electric transmission and railway rights-of-way; and
5. Existing and emerging technology and construction methods, such as grid-enhancing
technologies, advanced conductors and so-called strategic undergrounding, including a
cost-benefit analysis comparing buried high-voltage direct current lines with aerial high-
voltage alternating current lines and aerial high-voltage direct current lines.
Sec. 2. Stakeholder coordination. Resolved: That the office shall coordinate
with state agencies involved in the siting, permitting and regulation of electric transmission
