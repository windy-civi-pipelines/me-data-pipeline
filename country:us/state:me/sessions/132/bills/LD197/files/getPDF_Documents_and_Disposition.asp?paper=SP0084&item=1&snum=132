1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the Governor's Energy Office needs sufficient time to conduct the study
4 directed by this legislation and must commence its work as soon as possible; and
5 Whereas, the matters to be studied by the office implicate critical and pressing issues
6 related to the effects of climate change on the State, its communities and its environment
7 and natural resources; and
8 Whereas, the results of this study could have implications for electric transmission
9 infrastructure procurements in the near future; and
10 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
11 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
12 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
13 therefore, be it
14 Sec. 1. Study of future electric transmission infrastructure needs.
15 Resolved: That the Governor's Energy Office, referred to in this resolve as "the office,"

32 with transportation, electric transmission and railway rights-of-way; and
33 5. Existing and emerging technology and construction methods, such as grid-enhancing
34 technologies, advanced conductors and so-called strategic undergrounding, including a
35 cost-benefit analysis comparing buried high-voltage direct current lines with aerial high-
36 voltage alternating current lines and aerial high-voltage direct current lines.
37 Sec. 2. Stakeholder coordination. Resolved: That the office shall coordinate
38 with state agencies involved in the siting, permitting and regulation of electric transmission
