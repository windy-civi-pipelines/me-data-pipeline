7 command center during emergency situations including, but not limited to, covered

10 address the situation. The office employee granted entry for an emergency situation

12 situation.
13 C. The ombudsman may hold informal hearings and may request that any person
14 appear before the ombudsman, or at a hearing, and give testimony or produce
15 documentary or other evidence that the ombudsman considers relevant to a matter

26 or the commissioner's designee as is necessary to respond to the ombudsman's inquiries
27 or to carry out recommendations, but such information may not be further disclosed

30 maintained by the office to ensure that staff or incarcerated persons are not aware of
31 the identity of a complainant before, during and after an investigation to the greatest
32 extent practicable. The office may disclose personally identifying information for the
33 sole purpose of carrying out an investigation. Rules adopted pursuant to this paragraph

40 may be considered by the office as an appropriate subject of an investigation.
