12 situation.
13 C. The ombudsman may hold informal hearings and may request that any person
14 appear before the ombudsman, or at a hearing, and give testimony or produce
15 documentary or other evidence that the ombudsman considers relevant to a matter

27 or to carry out recommendations, but such information may not be further disclosed

30 maintained by the office to ensure that staff or incarcerated persons are not aware of
31 the identity of a complainant before, during and after an investigation to the greatest
32 extent practicable. The office may disclose personally identifying information for the
33 sole purpose of carrying out an investigation. Rules adopted pursuant to this paragraph

16 length made to the ombudsman by that agency or person in defense or mitigation of
17 the action at issue.
