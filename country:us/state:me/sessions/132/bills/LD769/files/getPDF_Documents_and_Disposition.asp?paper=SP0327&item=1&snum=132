37 person or others; or
38 B. The restraint has been approved as a behavior management program in accordance
39 with this section.
40 A restraint may not be used as punishment, for the convenience of the staff or as a substitute
41 for habilitative services. A restraint may impose only the least possible restriction
42 consistent with its purpose and must be removed as soon as the threat of imminent injury
Page 3 - 132LR0264(01)

413 ends. A restraint may not cause physical injury to the person receiving services and must
424 be designed to allow the greatest possible comfort and safety.
3 Daily records of the use of restraints identified in paragraph A must be kept, which may be
4 accomplished by meeting reportable event requirements.
5 Daily records of the use of restraints identified in paragraph B must be kept, and a summary
6 of the daily records pertaining to the person must be made available for review by the
7 person's planning team, as defined in section 5461, subsection 8‑C, on a schedule
8 determined by the team. The review by the personal planning team may occur no less
9 frequently than quarterly. The summary of the daily records must state the type of restraint
10 used, the duration of the use and the reasons for the use. A monthly summary of all daily
11 records pertaining to all persons must be relayed to the advocacy agency designated

16 protect the adult from imminent injury to that adult or others. The use of restraint must be
17 documented in accordance with the department's reportable event requirements.
18 SUMMARY
1199 This bill amends the law governing access to behavioral health supports for adults with
2200 an intellectual disability or autism by replacing a complex multiparty review process with
2211 a clinical review requirement. It also removes the authority to use restraints on adults except
2222 as an emergency short-term step to protect the adult from imminent injury to that adult or
2233 others. It also codifies existing rules on safety devices, making it clear that such devices
2244 are not considered positive behavioral health support plans and therefore do not require the
2255 same level of review as positive behavioral health support plans. Also, to conform with
2266 current practice, the bill repeals a provision of law regarding the authority of providers of
2277 residential services to establish house rules in residential units owned or operated by the
2288 provider.
