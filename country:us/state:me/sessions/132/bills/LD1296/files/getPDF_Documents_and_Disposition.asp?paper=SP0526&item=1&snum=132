1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 10 MRSA ยง1197, sub-ยง1, as enacted by PL 1991, c. 631, is amended to
3 read:
4 1. Parts or labor; satisfaction of warranty. If a franchisor requires or permits a
5 franchisee to perform labor or provide parts to satisfy a warranty created by the franchisor,
6 the franchisor shall properly and promptly fulfill its warranty obligations and:
7 A. Reimburse the franchisee at the retail rate customarily charged for any all parts
8 provided used by the franchisee to satisfy the warranty. If the franchisor provides a part
9 to the franchisee for a specific warranty repair, the franchisor shall compensate the
10 franchisee for the difference between the cost of the part to the franchisee and the full
11 retail price of the part, which may not exceed 100% of the total reimbursement cost
12 under paragraph B of the labor required to perform the repair; and
13 B. Reimburse the franchisee for any actual labor performed by the franchisee to satisfy
14 the warranty, which must be reasonable and supported by the franchisee's records.
15 Reimbursement for labor may not be less than the retail rate customarily charged by
16 that franchisee for the same labor when not performed to satisfy a warranty. To be
17 entitled to reimbursement under this section, a franchisee must post in a place
18 conspicuous to service customers the rate for labor not performed to satisfy a warranty.
19 SUMMARY
2200 This bill amends the law governing watercraft franchisor warranty reimbursements by
2211 requiring the franchisor to compensate the franchisee for parts used by the franchisee to
2222 conduct a specific warranty repair and, for a part provided by the franchiser, the difference
2233 between the cost of a part and the retail price of a part, which may not exceed 100% of the
2244 reimbursement cost of the labor to perform the repair. The bill also requires that labor billed
2255 by a franchisee to perform a warranty repair be reasonable and supported by the franchisee's
2266 records.
