23 subsection as "the program."
24 A. A qualified individual may claim a credit under this section based on loan payments
25 made directly by the taxpayer to a relevant lender or lenders only with respect to loans
26 that are part of the qualified individual's financial aid package and only with respect to
27 loan payment amounts paid directly by the taxpayer during that part of the taxable year
28 that the qualified individual was a resident individual. Refinanced loans or
29 consolidated loans that are part of the qualified individual's financial aid package are
30 eligible for the credit under this section if the refinanced loans or consolidated loans
31 remain separate from other debt, but only in proportion to the portion of the loan
32 payments that are otherwise eligible under this section.
33 B. Loans obtained from a person related to the qualified individual or from any person

5 a qualified individual with unused carryover credits pursuant to section 5217‑D,
6 subsection 2, paragraph A from the credit for educational opportunity generated in the
7 10 years from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2021 may carry over and apply to the

14 credit, to the extent the credit is based on loans included in the financial aid package
15 acquired to obtain a bachelor's degree or associate degree in science, technology,
16 engineering or mathematics in any taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2019
17 and before January 1, 2022, the maximum credit allowed under this section is $3,500
18 for the qualified individual's taxable year beginning in either 2022 or 2023, whichever
19 taxable year is elected by the qualified individual. Any credit amount allowed in excess
20 of $2,500 as a result of this paragraph is not applied against the lifetime credit cap
21 under paragraph D.
22 F. For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, an otherwise qualified
23 individual may carry forward credits for qualified loan payments in excess of the
24 $2,500 annual limit, up to the lifetime credit cap amount. To the extent that the early
25 payment of the qualifying loan exceeds the maximum $2,500 credit available to the
26 qualified individual in that tax year, the remainder of the balance paid on the qualifying
27 loan after subtracting the credit amount claimed may be carried forward as a credit
28 under this paragraph available to the taxpayer in subsequent tax years. The total credit
29 received in a tax year, including application of any carry-over credits under this
30 paragraph, may not exceed $2,500.
31 (1) Carry-over credit amounts under this paragraph are nonrefundable when
32 claimed and may not reduce the taxpayer’s tax liability below zero.
33 (2) For purposes of this paragraph, notwithstanding subsection 1, paragraph E,
34 subparagraph (2), "otherwise qualified individual" includes a nonresident
35 taxpayer.'
36 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section
37 number to read consecutively.
