12 discretion, but not more frequently than annually;

17 5% of the covered employee's salary or wages to the program and may elect to opt out
18 of unenroll from the program at any time or contribute at any higher or lower rate,
19 expressed as a percentage of salary or wages, or, if the board in its discretion permits,
20 expressed as a flat dollar amount, subject in all cases to the IRA contribution and

34 without reasonable cause to enroll a covered employee in the program as required who

37 after the program communicates with the employer 3 times;
38 Sec. 5. 5 MRSA §173, sub-§4, ¶A, as amended by PL 2023, c. 167, §7, is further

425 been assessed with respect to a covered employee, is subject to a penalty for any portion
436 of that calendar year during which the covered employee continues to be unenrolled
447 without opting out of unenrolling from participation in the program. The amount of
458 any penalty imposed on a covered employer for the failure to enroll a covered employee
469 without reasonable cause is determined as follows:
7 (1) From July 1, 2025 to June 30, 2026, the maximum penalty per covered
