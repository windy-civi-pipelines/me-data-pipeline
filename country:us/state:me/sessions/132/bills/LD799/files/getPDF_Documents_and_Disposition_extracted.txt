26 gender of an employee based upon an existing record if the employee's gender in the record
27 is based upon self-identification by the employee. Prior to submitting the data to the bureau
28 pursuant to subsection 3, the employer shall allow an employee the opportunity to review
29 the submission and make any correction to an error in the employee's data.
30 3. Reporting of data. Beginning June 1, 2026, and annually thereafter, a covered
