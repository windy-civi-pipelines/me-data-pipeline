Resolve, to Ensure the Removal of Aqueous Film-forming Foam from the
Former Brunswick Naval Air Station
Sec. 1. Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority; activities regarding
removal of aqueous film-forming foam. Resolved: That the Midcoast Regional
Redevelopment Authority, established in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, section
13083-G and referred to in this resolve as "the authority," shall take all necessary steps to
ensure that:
1. No later than December 31, 2025, all fire suppression systems and any other systems
containing aqueous film-forming foam that are located on any property leased or owned by
the authority are shut off or otherwise made incapable of dispensing or releasing aqueous
film-forming foam;
2. No later than December 31, 2025, all aqueous film-forming foam or aqueous film-
forming foam concentrate not contained in a fire suppression system or other system that
is located on any property leased or owned by the authority is removed from that property;
3. No later than July 1, 2026, funding is acquired by the authority sufficient to cover
the anticipated costs of completely purging all fire suppression systems and any other
systems containing aqueous film-forming foam that are located on any property leased or
owned by the authority so that those systems no longer contain any aqueous film-forming
foam or any residue containing aqueous film-forming foam as provided in subsection 4;
and
4. No later than December 31, 2026, all fire suppression systems and any other systems
containing aqueous film-forming foam that are located on any property leased or owned by
the authority are completely purged so that those systems no longer contain any aqueous
film-forming foam or any residue containing aqueous film-forming foam.
As used in this resolve, "aqueous film-forming foam" means a fire suppressant foam
containing fluorinated surfactants intended for extinguishing flammable liquid fires.
