7 SUMMARY
88 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, replaces the bill with
99 a resolve. It directs the Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority to take all necessary
1100 steps to ensure that:
11 1. No later than December 31, 2025, all fire suppression systems and any other systems
12 containing aqueous film-forming foam that are located on any property leased or owned by
13 the authority are shut off or otherwise made incapable of dispensing or releasing aqueous
14 film-forming foam;
15 2. No later than December 31, 2025, all aqueous film-forming foam or aqueous film-
16 forming foam concentrate not contained in a fire suppression system or other system that
17 is located on any property leased or owned by the authority is removed from that property;
18 3. No later than July 1, 2026, funding is acquired by the authority sufficient to cover
19 the anticipated costs of completely purging all fire suppression systems and any other
20 systems containing aqueous film-forming foam that are located on any property leased or
21 owned by the authority so that those systems no longer contain any aqueous film-forming
22 foam or any residue containing aqueous film-forming foam; and
23 4. No later than December 31, 2026, all fire suppression systems and any other systems
24 containing aqueous film-forming foam that are located on any property leased or owned by
25 the authority are completely purged so that those systems no longer contain any aqueous
26 film-forming foam or any residue containing aqueous film-forming foam.
27 The preliminary fiscal impact statement for the bill identifies a potential unfunded state
28 mandate in the bill's prohibiting the discharge, test, storage or use of aqueous film-forming
29 foam on any property leased or owned by the Midcoast Regional Redevelopment
30 Authority. The committee reviewed the preliminary fiscal impact statement and determined
31 that, although those activities constitute a required expansion or modification of activities
32 so as to necessitate additional expenditures, the Midcoast Regional Redevelopment
33 Authority is not a local unit of government within the meaning of the Constitution of Maine,
34 Article IX, Section 21 and, accordingly, the amendment does not represent a state mandate.
