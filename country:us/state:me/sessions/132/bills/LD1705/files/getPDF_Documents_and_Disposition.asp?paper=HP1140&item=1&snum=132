1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, adult education programs across the State provide essential services to
4 thousands of residents, including those in workforce development programs, adult basic
5 education programs such as English language acquisition programs, high school
6 equivalency and diploma programs, college transitions programming, digital literacy
7 programs and those in lifelong learning programs; and
8 Whereas, adult education has been chronically underfunded at the state level for over
9 10 years, creating a significant strain on local communities and programs; and
10 Whereas, the working group convened pursuant to Public Law 2023, chapter 412,
11 Part RRR, section 2 and tasked with studying adult education funding did not have time to
12 fully address funding concerns or develop an improved funding solution; and
13 Whereas, fully funding adult education is essential to meeting the State's economic
14 and workforce development goals, addressing the needs of growing immigrant and refugee
15 populations in the State and providing equitable access to education for all residents of the
16 State; and
17 Whereas, the career advancement and navigation pilot program established pursuant
18 to Public Law 2021, chapter 483, Part LL has been very successful and is slated to end
19 without additional funding; and
20 Whereas, career advancement and navigation pilot program staff provide students
21 with academic support, transition support for students entering community college and
22 referrals to resources on and off campus; and
23 Whereas, this legislation codifies the pilot program in order to prevent a lapse in
24 services from the program; and
25 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
26 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
27 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
28 therefore,
29 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
30 Sec. 1. 20-A MRSA §14 is enacted to read:
