18 SUMMARY
1199 This amendment limits the duties of the African American Studies Advisory Council
2200 to establishing a baseline measure of the implementation of African American studies in
2211 school administrative units using data collected by the Department of Education. The
2222 amendment also strikes the provision related to the convening of a stakeholder group to
2233 study an African American studies component to teacher certification requirements and
2244 instead allows the State Board of Education to adopt rules to require such a component if
2255 the State Board of Education determines that such rules are necessary.
