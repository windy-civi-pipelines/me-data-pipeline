24 individual's application is received by the department, specifically indicating the type and
25 amount of services approved or denied, except that, at the request of the individual, the
26 department shall extend the deadline by an additional 15 days for the purpose of providing
27 additional information necessary to establish eligibility. If information needed from a 3rd
28 party necessary to determine eligibility is not available at the time of the deadline, this
29 deadline may be extended until that information is available. The department shall provide
30 guidance and assist the individual to the extent possible in promptly securing any 3rd-party
31 information necessary to determine eligibility.
32 Services, including tuition, books, fees, stipends, child care and transportation, for which
33 the applicant is determined eligible must be provided retroactively to the date of application
34 or the date there is demonstrated need for services covered by the program and required for

39 to verify eligibility unless it has first sought to access that information from any electronic
40 or other resource reasonably available to the department. If needed information to complete
41 the application is not available, the department shall contact the applicant at least 20 days
42 following the applicant's date of application by the applicant's preferred method of
43 communication to notify the applicant of any additional or missing information needed by
44 the department and to provide additional guidance that the applicant can use to obtain
45 information necessary to establish eligibility to the extent possible.
Page 2 - 132LR2349(01)

1 The costs for an educational transcript, credential evaluation or similar requirement needed
2 to determine eligibility for the program must be paid for by the program for any applicant
3 who is otherwise eligible for participation, as determined by the department, if funds are
4 not reasonably available from another source for this purpose.
5 Sec. 9. 26 MRSA §2033, sub-§7-A is enacted to read:
6 7-A. Appeal. A written decision related to eligibility for, or the provision of, services
7 under this section must provide notice that the decision may be appealed by an individual
8 through a request for a hearing within 30 days of receipt of the decision in accordance with
9 rules adopted by the department and consistent with Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 4. The
10 30-day appeal period may be extended up to 15 additional days if the individual can show
11 good cause for failing to appeal within the initial 30-day period. If the individual files a
12 written appeal within 10 days of a decision to terminate the participant from the program
13 or terminate or reduce assistance being provided, the decision may not be implemented
14 pending the outcome of the appeal process. If no appeal is filed, the decision becomes final.
15 The first step in the appeal process is reconsideration of the decision by a program manager.
16 The program manager shall issue a written decision within 15 days of the filing of the
17 appeal and may consider new evidence presented during the appeal process. The decision
18 may reflect a resolution to the appeal or, if a resolution was not reached, it must reflect the
19 program manager's decision.
20 If the program manager issues a written decision that is adverse to the individual, the
21 department shall advise in that notice that the individual has a right to appeal the decision
22 within 30 days of receiving the notice to an impartial hearing officer, who will make a new
23 decision in accordance with Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 4. The appeal period may be
24 extended up to an additional 15 days for good cause.
25 A hearing officer shall render a decision within 30 days of the hearing request and may
26 affirm, set aside, modify or remand the program manager's decision. A hearing decision
27 affirming, setting aside or modifying the program manager's decision pursuant to this
28 subsection is final agency action and may be appealed to the Superior Court.
29 Sec. 10. 26 MRSA c. 26-A, sub-c. 2, headnote is amended to read:

Page 3 - 132LR2349(01)

411 workers via peer navigators employed by community-based organizations. The program
422 must prioritize individuals from populations that may face significant barriers to
433 employment as described in subsection 2, paragraph A and support successful access to
444 Department of Labor resources and maintenance of sustainable employment to increase
455 their economic security. The Department of Labor, referred to in this subchapter as "the

477 to contract with qualified entities to operate the program under subsection 2. The program

10 workforce navigation services that are based on a strengths-based case management
11 model and performed by individuals with shared lived experience. The program shall
12 advocate for, and provide sustained and reliable support to, individuals in their
13 transitions to improved economic security through employment, including by
14 providing education about program rules and community resources to facilitate
15 informed self-advocacy and life planning;
16 B. Work with community organizations, known and trusted by individuals described
17 in subsection 2, paragraph A, and through trusted peer navigators to proactively
18 identify and engage with unemployed and underemployed individuals and provide
19 them with the workforce navigation services under paragraph A and opportunities for
20 education, training, employment and reemployment assistance;
21 C. Introduce and connect individuals to career centers operated by the department, its
22 workforce partners and educational institutions and help the individuals, as needed,
23 navigate employment services and education and training programs operated by these
24 entities. The program shall help facilitate communication and trust building between
25 the individuals and these entities, including providing help completing applications;
26 assistance with complying with eligibility verification processes; and support for
27 participant progress and persistence;
28 D. Provide timely, responsive, flexible and individualized support when necessary to
29 help individuals meet basic needs so the individuals are more able to successfully
30 engage with work-related support services and find and retain employment, which
31 includes accessing support from both public and private sources, including support for
32 transportation, utilities and child care;
33 E. Promote trusted and successful relationships between individuals and government
34 agencies by furthering understanding of employment, education and training programs,
35 public assistance programs and associated rules, regulations, responsibilities and rights,
36 and any socioeconomic barriers to accessing these programs;
37 F. Conduct outreach to communities with disproportionately low enrollment in
38 unemployment insurance and reemployment assistance. The program shall provide
39 individual assistance, education and referrals for individuals applying for and making
40 ongoing claims for unemployment compensation, including offering assistance
41 connecting with department staff and coaching on self-advocacy for claimants
42 experiencing barriers to services. The program shall inform individuals about
43 provisions of law that may assist low-income and frequently unemployed individuals
44 disproportionately, including the dislocated worker benefits program under section
Page 4 - 132LR2349(01)

415 1043, subsection 5, paragraph B and section 1191, subsection 4, paragraph A, partial

7 2. Qualified entities. To be eligible to receive a workforce navigation contract under
8 this section, an entity must:
9 A. Demonstrate that it has existing, trusted relationships with individuals, groups and
10 organizations from populations that may face significant barriers to employment,

38 performance requirements set forth in the contracts.
39 C. The commissioner shall give priority for contracts to qualified entities that are a
40 recognized source of support, expertise and community leadership for populations that
41 may face significant barriers to employment as described in subsection 2, paragraph A,

43 disabilities and other low-income individuals with socioeconomic barriers to

Page 5 - 132LR2349(01)

1 D. Workforce navigation services provided by qualified entities that receive workforce
2 navigation contracts must be coordinated with and supplement, not supplant, services

5 performed in a manner that is culturally and linguistically appropriate to the population
6 served, including individuals with limited English proficiency, individuals with low
7 literacy and individuals with disabilities, recognizing the varying levels of digital
8 literacy and access to technology among individuals in need of services.
9 4. Funding. Of the Competitive Skills Scholarship Fund planned yield described in
10 section 1166, at least 12% of the annual planned yield must be used for the program. Any
11 funds not expended in the contract year by the contracted entity must be returned to the
12 Competitive Skills Scholarship Fund, except that any funds for expenses that occurred in
13 that contract year but were not yet paid in that year must remain available to the contracted
14 entity. The department may also seek any available opportunities for funding as needed to
15 support and enhance the workforce navigation services provided under this section.
16 SUMMARY
1177 This bill eliminates the peer workforce navigator pilot program and establishes the
1188 Community Workforce Connections Program beginning October 1, 2025 to provide peer
1199 support and community-based workforce navigation services to unemployed and
2200 underemployed individuals facing barriers to employment to help them increase their
2211 economic security. The bill provides that the program be funded by the Competitive Skills
2222 Scholarship Fund.
23 The bill amends the law governing the Competitive Skills Scholarship Program to
24 authorize an added method of service delivery through an educational cohort model
25 targeted to assist low-income individuals and individuals who may face barriers to
26 education or successful workforce participation participating in a shared curriculum or
27 program; increases the ways in which individuals can qualify for the program; and changes
28 the application, decision and appeal process.
