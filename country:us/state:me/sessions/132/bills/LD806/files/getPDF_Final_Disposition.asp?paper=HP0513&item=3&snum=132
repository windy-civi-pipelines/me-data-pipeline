An Act to Amend the Scope of Practice for Expanded Function Dental
Assistants
Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, the current licensing requirements for an expanded function dental assistant
require passage of a separate dental radiologic technique and safety examination, which is
the same examination required for licensure of dental radiographers; and
Whereas, this legislation eliminates the requirement that an expanded function dental
assistant must be separately licensed as a dental radiographer and instead provides for
exposing and processing radiographs under the assistant's scope of practice; and
Whereas, this legislation must be enacted immediately so that expanded function
dental assistants are not required to pay an additional license fee; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore,
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
Sec. 1. 32 MRSA §9854, sub-§3, ¶A, as amended by PL 2015, c. 429, §19, is
further amended to read:

radiographer licensed under chapter 143;
Sec. 2. 32 MRSA §18373, sub-§1, ¶L, as amended by PL 2021, c. 223, §10, is
further amended to read:

Sec. 3. 32 MRSA §18373, sub-§1, ¶HH, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 223, §10, is
