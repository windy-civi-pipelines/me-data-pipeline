1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, 2 recent blue ribbon commissions to study emergency medical services
4 established by Public Law 2021, chapter 749 and Resolve 2023, chapter 98, respectively,
5 identified lack of adequate funding as a critical issue facing the emergency medical services
6 system in the State; and
7 Whereas, without increased financial support, emergency medical services providers
8 are at risk of closure, leaving areas of the State without adequate access to life-saving
9 emergency services; and
10 Whereas, increasing reimbursement rates under the MaineCare program will provide
11 much needed financial relief and will further leverage additional federal funding for
12 emergency medical services in the State; and
13 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
14 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
15 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
16 therefore,
17 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
18 Sec. 1. Ambulance services reimbursement rate. Notwithstanding the Maine
19 Revised Statutes, Title 22, section 3174-JJ or any other provision of law to the contrary,
