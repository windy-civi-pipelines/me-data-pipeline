17 Sec. 2. 12 MRSA §6506, sub-§2-A is enacted to read:
18 2-A. Exception to using vessel named on license holder's license for commercial

20 authorize a holder of a commercial halibut fishing license to use a vessel other than the
21 vessel named on that license holder's license to fish for, take, possess, ship or transport
22 halibut if the license holder documents to the commissioner that the vessel named on that
23 license holder's license has become temporarily inoperable because of an accident or a
24 mechanical failure and requests in writing to the commissioner that the commissioner
25 authorize the use of another vessel to fish for or take halibut. The commissioner's
26 authorization may require the license holder to fish for, take, possess and land halibut
27 separately from any halibut taken under another license listing the same vessel to ensure
28 that harvest limits are not exceeded. An authorization granted by the commissioner to a
29 license holder due to an accident or a mechanical failure may not exceed 2 weeks. The
30 commissioner may authorize one 2-week extension per license holder during the
31 commercial halibut fishing season.
32 Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation
33 takes effect when approved.
34 SUMMARY
3355 This bill provides that the holder of a commercial halibut fishing license may fish for,
3366 take, possess, ship, transport or sell halibut that the holder has taken using only the vessel
3377 named on the license. The bill also provides an exception to this provision. It allows a
3388 commercial halibut fishing license holder to request authorization from the Commissioner
3399 of Marine Resources to use a vessel other than the vessel identified on that license holder's
4400 license when that license holder's vessel is temporarily inoperable.
