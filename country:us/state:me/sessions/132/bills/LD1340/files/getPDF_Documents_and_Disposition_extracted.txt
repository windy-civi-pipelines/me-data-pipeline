15 Eligible project sponsors include local governments, municipal conservation commissions,
16 soil and water conservation districts and private nonprofit organizations.
17 3. Fund proceeds; uses. The department may award grants based on the extent to

19 flood events and advances the goals of restoring habitat for fish, including sea-run fish and
20 native brook trout, and wildlife. In awarding grants, the department shall consider:
21 A. The priority status of the culvert to be upgraded or replaced for native brook trout
22 and sea-run fish restoration, based on available stream survey data, statewide
23 prioritization for aquatic connectivity and presence in priority watersheds of salmon,
24 river herring and other diadromous fish;
25 B. The extent to which the proposed project meets the Department of Environmental
26 Protection's design standards for a stream's bankfull width, with a natural stream
27 bottom or embedded structure, and meets or exceeds the department's 50-year
28 floodplain standard;
29 C. The degree of urgency of the proposed project, including whether a culvert is at
30 high risk of failure due to age or location within a watershed or reach with high flood
31 risk or severe flood history;
32 D. The expected contribution to reducing the frequency or severity of flooding to
33 upstream and downstream communities and improving storm water management
34 within the proposed project area; and
35 E. The extent to which the proposed project represents an efficient and cost-effective
36 investment, including the proportion of total project funding provided from other
37 sources and the potential avoided costs associated with the proposed project.
38 4. Grant proceeds; prohibited uses. Grants awarded under subsection 3 may not be
39 used:
40 A. To cover all of the costs associated with a proposed project; or
41 B. For a culvert upgrade or replacement on a state road or private road.
