1199 This amendment replaces the term "culvert upgrade" with "stream crossing" to specify
2200 that the program relates to a stream crossing replacement. The amendment updates the
2211 criteria for awarding grants. The Department of Transportation is required to consider the
2222 extent to which the project meets 1.2 times the stream's bankfull width standard and the
2233 stream crossing meets the department's flood standard, rather than the Department of
2244 Environmental Protection's design standard. The amendment also removes the requirement
2255 that the Department of Transportation adopt rules regarding the grant program and the
2266 Municipal Stream Crossing Fund.
