1 G. "Pricing differential" means, with respect to the volume unit basis of a covered good
2 purchased by a covered retailer or covered wholesaler compared to the volume unit
3 basis of the same covered good purchased by a dominant covered retailer:
4 (1) The difference in price of the covered good multiplied by the quantity sold; or
5 (2) The difference in the price equivalent of the terms of sale of the covered good,

9 retailer to purchase covered goods on behalf of the dominant covered retailer.

25 pricing practices in violation of this subsection if the covered supplier:
26 A. Fails to extend the same terms of sale of a covered good to all covered retailers and
27 covered wholesalers that purchase the covered good on the same volume unit basis in
28 reasonably contemporaneous sales;
29 B. Fails to provide, within 14 days of a written request from a covered retailer or
30 covered wholesaler that has purchased a covered good or received an offer, including
31 terms of sale, for a covered good from the covered supplier, the anonymized terms of
32 sale from all contracts with dominant covered retailers that purchased the same covered
33 good on the same volume unit basis during the 180-day period prior to which the
34 purchase or offer, including terms of sale, was made;
35 C. Refuses the sale of a covered good to a covered retailer or covered wholesaler on
36 the basis of a distinction in channels of trade, or other similar basis, if the effect is to
37 facilitate a difference in terms of sale in violation of paragraph A; or
38 D. Refuses the sale of a covered good to a covered retailer or a covered wholesaler if:
39 (1) The covered retailer is not a dominant covered retailer;
40 (2) The covered retailer or the covered wholesaler has made and completed
41 payment for purchases from the covered supplier within the previous 12 months;
Page 2 - 132LR2187(01)

1 (3) The covered retailer or the covered wholesaler has made a request for the
2 covered supplier to provide to such covered retailer or covered wholesaler the same
3 terms of sale provided to other covered retailers or covered wholesalers, consistent
4 with the terms of this subsection; and
5 (4) The covered retailer or covered wholesaler has no commercially reasonable
6 justification.
7 For the purposes of this subsection, a covered supplier is liable for any violation of this
8 subsection committed by the covered supplier's purchasing agent or contracted 3rd-party
9 entity.
10 3. Unfair pricing practices; dominant covered retailers. A dominant covered retailer
11 engages in unfair pricing practices in violation of this subsection if the dominant covered
12 retailer:
13 A. Imposes on or requires of a covered supplier terms of sale with respect to a covered
14 good if the dominant covered retailer knows or reasonably should know that:
15 (1) The dominant covered retailer or its purchasing agent will acquire more of the
16 covered good than another dominant covered retailer; and
17 (2) Purchases by the dominant covered retailer or its purchasing agent under the
18 terms of sale are likely to result in unreasonably diminished availability of the
19 covered good to another covered retailer; or
20 B. Takes any action that the dominant covered retailer, its purchasing agent or a
21 contracted 3rd-party entity intends, knows or has reason to know will coerce or induce
22 a covered supplier to violate this subsection.
23 For the purposes of this subsection, a dominant covered retailer is liable for any violation
24 of this subsection committed by the dominant covered retailer's purchasing agent or other
25 contracted 3rd-party entity.
26 4. Penalties and remedies. An entity that violates this section commits a civil
27 violation for which a civil penalty, recoverable in a civil action, may be adjudged of not
28 more than the greater of:
29 A. One and 1/2 actual damages incurred by entities as a result of the violation; or
30 B. The pricing differential suffered by a covered retailer or a covered wholesaler.
31 Whenever the Attorney General has reason to believe that a covered supplier or dominant
32 covered retailer is in violation of or intends to violate this section, the Attorney General
33 may bring a civil action seeking civil penalties in the name of the State against the covered
34 supplier or dominant covered retailer to restrain such violation by temporary or permanent
35 injunction.
36 5. Affirmative defense. An entity alleged to have committed a violation of this section
37 is not subject to penalties under subsection 4 if the entity establishes by a preponderance
38 of evidence that:
39 A. Any difference in the terms of sale was predominantly attributable to a covered
40 retailer engaging in self-distribution of the covered good at issue or otherwise lowering
41 the overall costs of the covered supplier through genuine efficiencies, such as
42 economies in distribution or manufacturing;
Page 3 - 132LR2187(01)

1 B. A covered retailer voluntarily accepted terms of sale relating to a covered good that
2 were not the same terms of sale as the terms of sale of another covered retailer in
3 exchange for commercially reasonable consideration, as long as the acceptance of the
4 terms of sale was not pretextual, coerced or made under duress; or
5 C. The terms of sale applied only to cases in which there was an actual or imminent
6 deterioration of perishable goods, obsolescence of seasonal goods, distress sales under
7 court process or sales in good faith in discontinuance of the goods concerned.
8 6. Covered supplier immunity. A covered supplier is immune from liability for a
9 violation of this section if the covered supplier establishes by a preponderance of evidence
10 that:
11 A. The violation was imposed on or required of the covered supplier by a dominant
12 covered retailer;
13 B. The covered supplier would have suffered substantial harm to the covered supplier's
14 business were it to refuse the demand of the dominant covered retailer that led to or
15 constituted the violation; and
16 C. The covered supplier made a good faith effort to disclose the dominant covered
17 retailer's conduct to the Attorney General.
18 This subsection does not apply to conduct by a covered supplier that constitutes collusion
19 in violation of federal or state antitrust law.
20 7. Construction. Except as otherwise specifically provided, this chapter may not be
21 construed to limit, impair or supersede any antitrust laws or require an entity to do business
22 with any other entity unless refusal to do so would violate a provision of this section.
23 SUMMARY
2244 This bill establishes laws prohibiting large grocery suppliers and retailers from
2255 engaging in price discrimination or imposing discriminatory terms of sale and extracting
2266 unfair and anticompetitive concessions from wholesalers and suppliers. The bill provides
2277 the Attorney General authority to enforce those provisions.
