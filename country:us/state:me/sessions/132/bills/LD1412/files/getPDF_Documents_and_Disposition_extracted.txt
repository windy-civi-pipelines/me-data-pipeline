1188 supply costs.
19 This bill increases the amount that a consumer-owned transmission and distribution
20 utility may keep in a contingency reserve fund to reflect up to a 50% addition to yearly
21 revenues over the amount required to operate the utility. The bill removes the language that
22 excludes any purchased power supply costs from this formula.
