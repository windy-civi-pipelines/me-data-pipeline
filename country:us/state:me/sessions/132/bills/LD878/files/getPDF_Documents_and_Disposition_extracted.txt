1 Sec. 1. Independent Commission to Study the Effects of 5G and Other Non-
2 ionizing Radio Frequency Radiation-emitting Technology established.
3 Resolved: That the Independent Commission to Study the Effects of 5G and Other Non-
4 ionizing Radio Frequency Radiation-emitting Technology, referred to in this resolve as "the
5 independent commission," is established.
6 Sec. 2. Independent commission membership. Resolved: That,
7 notwithstanding Joint Rule 353, the independent commission consists of 11 members
8 appointed as follows:

10 A. Two members of the Senate, including one member from each of the 2 parties
11 holding the largest number of seats in the Legislature;
12 B. One member with expertise in radio frequency and biomedical engineering and
13 electromagnetics and with experience teaching this subject matter at the university
14 level;
15 C. One member with expertise in wildlife biology and with experience teaching this
16 subject matter at the university level; and
17 D. One member with research experience in electromagnetic field and wireless
18 technology policy;
19 2. Five members appointed by the Speaker of the House as follows:
20 A. Two members of the House of Representatives, including one member from each
21 of the 2 parties holding the largest number of seats in the Legislature;
22 B. One member with expertise in physics and engineering and with experience teaching
23 in the field of occupational health at the university level;
24 C. One member with expertise in public health policy and research experience in
25 disease prevention related to the effects of electromagnetic radiation exposure; and
26 D. One member with expertise in entomology and wildlife biology and experience in
27 the study of the effects of radio frequency radiation exposure; and
28 3. One member representing the public with experience living with a health condition
29 related to electromagnetic radiation exposure, appointed by the Governor.
30 A person may not be appointed to or serve on the independent commission unless that
31 person has certified to the appointing authority that the person has no direct financial
32 interest in wireless communication services, technology companies or wireless industry
33 organizations. For the purposes of this paragraph, "direct financial interest" includes, but is
34 not limited to, receiving funding for research or compensation for consultation services.
35 Sec. 3. Chairs. Resolved: That the first-named Senate member is the Senate chair
36 and the first-named House of Representatives member is the House chair of the
37 independent commission.
38 Sec. 4. Appointments; convening of independent commission. Resolved:
39 That all appointments must be made no later than 30 days following the effective date of
40 this resolve. The appointing authorities shall notify the Executive Director of the
41 Legislative Council once all appointments have been completed. After appointment of all
Page 1 - 132LR2195(01)
412 members, the chairs shall call and convene the first meeting of the independent
423 commission. If 30 days or more after the effective date of this resolve a majority of but not
434 all appointments have been made, the chairs may request authority and the Legislative
445 Council may grant authority for the independent commission to meet and conduct its
456 business.
6 Sec. 5. Duties. Resolved: That the independent commission shall:
7 1. Review federal and state laws and regulations governing wireless communication
8 facilities and the history of the development of those laws and regulations;
9 2. Through briefings provided by independent commission members or nonmembers
10 with relevant expertise, review scientific literature, experimental research and studies, with
11 a focus on peer-reviewed, published studies and other publications by experts who are not
12 compensated by a for-profit entity involved in so-called 5G wireless technology or in other
13 wireless technology or in the utility industry, that have investigated or are intended to
14 understand the effects of so-called 5G wireless technology and other non-ionizing radio
15 frequency radiation-emitting wireless technology. The independent commission shall focus
16 its review on the effects of this technology on the populations, habitats and migrations of:
17 A. Birds;
18 B. Bees and insects; and
19 C. Other wildlife populations, as determined by the independent commission;
20 3. Through briefings provided by independent commission members or nonmembers
21 with relevant expertise, review scientific literature, experimental research and studies, with
22 a focus on peer-reviewed, published studies and other publications by experts who are not
23 compensated by a for-profit entity involved in so-called 5G wireless technology or in other
24 wireless technology or in the utility industry, that have investigated so-called 5G wireless
25 technology and other non-ionizing radio frequency radiation-emitting wireless technology,
26 at nonthermal levels for extended periods of time or in acute doses to children, including
27 animal studies intended to provide information on the risk of cancer, oxidative stress,
28 changes in neurological function and brain development and reproductive function. In
29 conducting its review under this subsection, the independent commission may include a
30 comparison of real-world measurements of the current levels of radio frequency radiation
31 in educational settings to the recommended levels that have been identified in independent
32 research studies, including in vivo, in vitro and epidemiological studies;
33 4. Solicit feedback from individuals with experience in business, law and public policy
34 as needed for the independent commission to complete its duties, and consult with
35 individuals with expertise in environmental health, medicine and occupational health,
36 toxicology and epidemiology;
37 5. Review the findings and recommendations contained in the November 1, 2020 final
38 report of the New Hampshire Commission to Study the Environmental and Health Effects
39 of Evolving 5G Technology that are relevant to and within the scope of the independent
40 commission's duties;
41 6. Identify relevant findings and considerations from the review of scientific literature
42 and experimental research and studies that may be unique to the State, including, but not
43 limited to, possible effects on agriculture, apiculture and tourism; and
Page 2 - 132LR2195(01)
1 7. Develop policy recommendations and questions, if any, for consideration by the
2 Legislature, informed by the independent commission's work studying the effects of so-
3 called 5G wireless technology and other non-ionizing radio frequency radiation-emitting
4 wireless technology on children and bird, bee, insect and other wildlife populations.
5 Sec. 6. Staff assistance. Resolved: That, notwithstanding Joint Rule 353, the
6 Legislative Council shall provide necessary staffing services to the independent
7 commission, except that the Legislative Council staff support is not authorized when the
8 Legislature is in regular or special session.
9 Sec. 7. Report. Resolved: That, no later than December 3, 2025, the independent
10 commission shall submit a report that includes a summary of its activities and
11 recommendations to the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology
12 and the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs.
13 SUMMARY
1144 This resolve creates the Independent Commission to Study the Effects of 5G and Other
1155 Non-ionizing Radio Frequency Radiation-emitting Technology. The independent
1166 commission is directed to review scientific literature related to the effects of so-called 5G
1177 wireless technology and other non-ionizing radio frequency radiation-emitting wireless
1188 technology on bird, bee, insect and other wildlife populations and to study the effects of
1199 long-term and acute exposure to 5G and other non-ionizing radio frequency radiation-
2200 emitting wireless technology and radio frequency radiation on children. The independent
2211 commission is required to report findings to the Joint Standing Committee on Energy,
2222 Utilities and Technology and the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural
2233 Affairs no later than December 3, 2025.
