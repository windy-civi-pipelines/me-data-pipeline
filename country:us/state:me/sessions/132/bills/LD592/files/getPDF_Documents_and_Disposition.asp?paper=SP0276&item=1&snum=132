18 SUMMARY
1199 The current Class D crime of endangering the welfare of a child under the Maine
2200 Revised Statutes, Title 17-A, section 554, subsection 1, paragraph C is established when a
2211 person violates a duty of care or protection to a child and thereby recklessly endangers the
2222 child. This bill amends the provision to describe the crime by attaching the culpable mental
2233 state element of recklessness to the violation of the duty. The bill amends the laws
2244 governing the crime by enacting more serious penalty provisions if a person's reckless
2255 violation of the duty of care or protection results in serious bodily injury to or death of a
2266 child. If the child suffers serious bodily injury as a result, the crime is a Class C crime; if
2277 the child dies, the crime is a Class B crime.
