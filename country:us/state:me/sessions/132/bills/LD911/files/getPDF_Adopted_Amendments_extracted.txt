1199 if a candidate dies or becomes disqualified less than 70 days before a primary election

2222 determined by ranked-choice voting regardless of the number of remaining qualified
2233 candidates. The amendment also specifies that a ranking, which means the number
2244 assigned on a ballot by a voter to a candidate to express the voter's preference for that
2255 candidate, will only be considered a ranking for the purpose of determining whether the
2266 ballot is exhausted for the purposes of the ranked-choice voting count. A candidate who
