22 assigned ranking number one on more than 50% of the ballots cast for that particular office,
23 the ranked‑choice voting count must proceed in rounds. In each round, the number of votes

27 potential outcomes.
28 A. If there are 2 or fewer continuing candidates, the candidate with the most votes is
29 declared the winner of the election.
30 B. If there are more than 2 continuing candidates, the last-place candidate is removed
31 from consideration and a new round begins.
32 Sec. 7. 21-A MRSA §723-A, sub-§2-A is enacted to read:
33 2-A. Excluded candidates. In any round of the ranked-choice voting count, a ballot
34 on which an excluded candidate is the highest-ranked candidate must be counted for the
35 next-highest-ranked continuing candidate.'
36 Amend the amendment by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or
37 section number to read consecutively.
