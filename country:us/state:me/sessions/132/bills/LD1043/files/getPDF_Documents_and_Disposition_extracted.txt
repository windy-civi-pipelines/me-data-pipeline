2277 qualifying veterans and active duty military members as determined by the Department of

2299 immediate family members to hold their own passes, rather than only permitting family
3300 members to use the qualifying veteran's or active duty military member's pass. The bill
3311 defines "immediate family members" as the spouse, domestic partner and dependent
3322 children of a veteran or active duty military member.
