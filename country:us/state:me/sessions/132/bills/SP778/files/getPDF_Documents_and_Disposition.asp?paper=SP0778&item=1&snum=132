JOINT RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY
OF THE LAST UNITED STATES COMBAT MISSION IN
SOUTHEAST ASIA AT THE END OF THE VIETNAM WAR
WHEREAS, United States involvement in the Vietnam War ended 50 years ago with the
Mayaguez Incident at Koh Tang, from May 12-15, 1975, the final United States combat
mission in Southeast Asia during this conflict; and
WHEREAS, in May 1975 the Cambodian Khmer Rouge navy seized the American cargo
ship SS Mayaguez and its crew of 39 in international waters. The Mayaguez was anchored at
Koh Tang Island near the Cambodian coast, and military planners believed the crew was on
the island. Air Force gunships sank 3 Cambodian patrol boats to prevent their taking the
Mayaguez's crew from Koh Tang to the mainland. Soon after, Marines boarded the Mayaguez
and found it abandoned; and
WHEREAS, Marines landed on Koh Tang in Air Force helicopters to rescue the crew, but
incomplete intelligence made the operation a near disaster. Expecting only light opposition, the
Air Force helicopters instead faced heavy fire from a large force. The Cambodians shot down
4 helicopters, damaged 5 more and killed 14 Americans. More United States troops and aircraft
urgently moved to reinforce the 131 Marines and 5 Air Force aircrew trapped on Koh Tang;
and
WHEREAS, as the assault unfolded, the Mayaguez crew appeared in a small boat and
were rescued unharmed. The operation immediately shifted from an offensive to rescuing the
trapped Marines; and
WHEREAS, another 100 Marines moved into Koh Tang to reinforce and extract the
trapped Marines. Coordinated Air Force support by attack aircraft, forward air controllers,
rescue helicopters and gunships pounded Cambodian targets while the Americans on the
ground fought hard to maintain their positions; and
WHEREAS, only 3 Air Force helicopters were left to extract more than 200 troops. They
tried time and again, braving fierce, accurate fire, but were repeatedly driven off. Finally, they
reached the beach and recovered 129 Marines in multiple trips, landing them quickly on Navy
ships and returning to the island for more. On the last trip to the beach, Air Force pararescueman
Tech. Sgt. Wayne Fisk left his helicopter to find 2 missing Marines still laying down covering
fire. He led them to the helicopter, and the 14-hour rescue ended as the aircraft left under fire;
and
WHEREAS, there were 3 Marines who were inadvertently left on the island in the
darkness and confusion and were killed and buried there within a few days by the Khmer
Rouge. Total United States casualties included 18 dead and 50 wounded. Twenty-three more
Air Force personnel died in a support force helicopter crash in Thailand due to mechanical
failure; and

WHEREAS, there were 48,000 men and women from the State of Maine who served in
Vietnam, while an additional 16,000 Mainers were serving worldwide during the Vietnam War
era; and
WHEREAS, the names of 343 Mainers who laid down their lives are etched on the black
granite of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., and 11 of our men are still
missing in Southeast Asia; now, therefore, be it
RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Thirty-second Legislature
now assembled in the First Special Session, on behalf of the people we represent, take this
opportunity to recognize the 50th anniversary of the last United States combat mission in
Southeast Asia at the end of the Vietnam War and to celebrate with the utmost gratitude the
service and sacrifice of every Mainer who fought in Vietnam and Southeast Asia during the
Vietnam War, especially those who paid the ultimate price and cannot be with us here today.
