3 CHAPTER 239
4 REGULATION OF BUSINESS SCREENING SERVICES' HANDLING OF
5 CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORD INFORMATION
6 §1500-AA. Definitions
7 For the purposes of this chapter, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following
8 terms have the following meanings.
9 1. Business screening service. "Business screening service" means a person regularly
10 engaged in the business of collecting, assembling, evaluating or disseminating criminal
11 history record information related to specific individuals for a fee. "Business screening
12 service" does not include a government entity or the news media.
13 2. Conviction. "Conviction" means any of the following accepted and recorded by the
14 court:
15 A. A plea of guilty; or
16 B. A verdict of guilty by a jury or a finding of guilty by the court.
17 3. Criminal history record information. "Criminal history record information" or
18 "record" has the same meaning as in Title 16, section 703, subsection 3.
19 §1500-BB. Criminal records
20 A business screening service may disseminate only criminal history record information
21 that reflects the complete and accurate record provided by the source of the criminal history
22 record information. A complete and accurate record is a record that has been updated within
23 30 days of its receipt or been verified with the source of the criminal history record
24 information within the previous 90 days as being up-to-date.
25 §1500-CC. Correction and deletion of criminal history record information
26 If the completeness or accuracy of criminal history record information maintained by
27 a business screening service is disputed by the individual who is the subject of the record,
28 the business screening service shall, without charge, investigate the disputed record.
29 1. Investigations. In conducting an investigation, the business screening service shall
30 review and consider all relevant information submitted by the subject of the criminal
31 history record information with respect to the disputed record to determine whether the
32 record maintained by the business screening service accurately reflects the content of the
33 official record, as maintained by the Department of Public Safety, Bureau of State Police,
34 State Bureau of Identification.
35 2. Correction and deletion of criminal history record information. If, upon
36 investigation, the business screening service determines that the criminal history record
37 information does not accurately reflect the content of the official record, the business
38 screening service shall correct the disputed record so as to accurately reflect the content of
Page 1 - 132LR2130(01)
319 the official record. If the disputed record is found to be sealed or the subject of a pardon,
420 the business screening service shall promptly delete the record. A business screening
431 service that complies with this subsection has satisfied its obligation to correct or delete
442 records pursuant to this section.
5 3. Terminating frivolous investigations. A business screening service may terminate
6 an investigation of disputed criminal history record information if the business screening
7 agency reasonably determines that the dispute is frivolous, and that determination may be
8 based on the failure of the subject of the record to provide sufficient information to
9 investigate the disputed record. Upon making a determination that the dispute is frivolous,
10 the business screening service shall inform the subject of the record of the specific reasons
11 why it has determined that the dispute is frivolous and provide a description of any
12 information required to investigate the disputed record.
13 4. Notice to subject of criminal history record information. Within 30 days from
14 the date when the business screening service receives notice that the subject of a criminal
15 history record information is disputing the record, the business screening service shall
16 notify the subject of the record of the results of the investigation, including:
17 A. Whether the investigation was completed or terminated; and
18 B. Any records corrected or deleted as a result of the investigation.
19 §1500-DD. Date and notice required
20 A business screening service that disseminates criminal history record information that
21 was collected on or after July 1, 2010, shall include the date when the record was collected
22 by the business screening service and a notice that the information may include criminal
23 history record information that has been sealed or otherwise has become inaccessible to the
24 public since that date.
25 §1500-EE. Effect of Fair Credit Reporting Act; violation; jurisdiction; remedies
26 Violations of this chapter are governed by this section.
27 1. Violation. A business screening service is considered to be in compliance with this
28 chapter if the business screening service is in compliance with those provisions of the
29 federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 United States Code, Chapter 41, Subchapter III that
30 regulate maintaining accuracy of records; investigations of disputed records, including
31 correction and deletion of records; and providing a notice with disseminated records similar
32 to that required in section 1500-DD. If the conduct of a business screening service violates
33 both the federal provisions described in this subsection and the provisions of this chapter,
34 the business screening service is in violation of this chapter and is liable to the individual
35 who is the subject of the criminal history record information in accordance with subsection
36 3.
37 2. Foreign corporations; service of process and jurisdiction. A business screening
38 service, that is a foreign corporation, that disseminates criminal history record information
39 in this State or that obtains a criminal record from a government entity or a court in this
40 State is considered to have consented to service of process in this State for purposes of Title
41 13-B, sections 1212-A and 1213 or any other applicable law and to the jurisdiction of courts
42 in this State for actions involving a violation of this chapter as described in subsection 1 or
43 for the recovery of remedies under this chapter. For the purposes of this subsection,
44 "foreign corporation" has the same meaning as in Title 13-B, section 102, subsection 6.

32 the conclusion of the hearing, if the court determines that the person who filed the motion
33 has established by a preponderance of the evidence each of the statutory prerequisites
34 specified in section 2262 or, 2262‑A or 2262-B, the court shall grant the motion and shall
35 issue a written order sealing the criminal history record information of the eligible criminal
36 conviction that was the subject of the motion. If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the court
37 determines that the person has not established one or more of the statutory prerequisites
38 specified in section 2262 or, 2262‑A or 2262-B, the court shall issue a written order denying
39 the motion. The order must contain written findings of fact supporting the court's
40 determination. A copy of the court's written order must be provided to the person and the
41 prosecutorial office that represented the State pursuant to subsection 3.
42 Sec. 13. 15 MRSA §2264, sub-§7, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 674, §1, is amended
43 to read:
Page 5 - 132LR2130(01)
1 7. Subsequent new criminal conviction; automatic loss of eligibility; person's duty
2 to notify. Notwithstanding a court order sealing the criminal history record information
3 pursuant to subsection 5, if at any time subsequent to the court's order the person is
4 convicted of a new crime in this State or in another jurisdiction, the criminal history record
5 information must be unsealed. This subsection does not apply to records sealed pursuant
6 to section 2262-A or 2262-B.
7 A. In the event of a new criminal conviction, the person shall promptly file a written
8 notice in the underlying criminal proceeding of the person's disqualification from
9 eligibility, identifying the new conviction, including the jurisdiction, court and docket
10 number of the new criminal proceeding. If the person fails to file the required written
11 notice and the court learns of the existence of the new criminal conviction, the court
12 shall notify the person of the apparent existence of the new conviction and offer the
13 person an opportunity to request a hearing to contest the fact of a new conviction.
14 B. If the person requests a hearing under paragraph A, the court shall, after giving
15 notice to the person and the appropriate prosecutorial office, hold a hearing. At the
16 hearing, the person has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that
17 the person has not been convicted of a crime subsequent to issuance of the sealing
18 order. At the conclusion of the hearing, if the court determines that the person has not
19 satisfied the burden of proof, it shall find that the person has been newly convicted of
20 the crime and as a consequence is no longer eligible for the sealing order and shall issue
21 a written order unsealing the criminal history record information, with written findings
22 of fact. If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the court determines that the person has
23 satisfied the burden of proof, it shall find that the person has not been convicted of the
24 new crime and issue a written order certifying this determination. A copy of the court's
25 written order must be provided to the person and the prosecutorial office that
26 represented the State.
27 C. If the person does not request a hearing under paragraph A, the court shall determine
28 that the person has not satisfied the burden of proof and the court shall find that the
29 person has been convicted of the new crime and as a consequence is no longer eligible
30 for the sealing order and shall issue a written order unsealing the criminal history record
31 information, with written findings of fact. A copy of the court's written order must be
32 provided to the person and the prosecutorial office that represented the State.
33 SUMMARY
3344 This bill amends provisions of the law governing post-judgment motions to seal
3355 criminal history record information by creating a new category of criminal conviction for
3366 which a person may file a motion to seal the related criminal history record information.
3377 Under the bill, a person may file a motion to seal criminal history record information for a
3388 criminal conviction for any current or former crime if the person shows by a preponderance
3399 of the evidence that the person has been a victim of sex trafficking or sexual exploitation,
4400 as defined by the bill, and the commission of the crime for which the person was convicted
4411 was a substantial result of sex trafficking or sexual exploitation.
42 The bill also provides that a person who is regularly engaged in the business of
43 collecting, assembling, evaluating or disseminating criminal history record information
44 related to specific individuals for a fee, also called a business screening service, is required
45 to disseminate only complete and accurate records; investigate disputed records; correct or
Page 6 - 132LR2130(01)
416 delete records found to be inaccurate or reflecting a criminal conviction that was sealed or
427 pardoned; and provide a notice with disseminated records including the date the record was
438 collected and a notice that information may include criminal records that have been sealed
449 or otherwise have become inaccessible to the public. A person is considered in violation of
550 these provisions only if the person's conduct violates these provisions and also violates
561 relevant provisions of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act. A person found in violation of
572 both the state and federal law is liable to the subject of the record for a penalty of $1,000
583 and additional remedies.

1 7. Subsequent new criminal conviction; automatic loss of eligibility; person's duty
2 to notify. Notwithstanding a court order sealing the criminal history record information
3 pursuant to subsection 5, if at any time subsequent to the court's order the person is
4 convicted of a new crime in this State or in another jurisdiction, the criminal history record
5 information must be unsealed. This subsection does not apply to records sealed pursuant
6 to section 2262-A or 2262-B.
7 A. In the event of a new criminal conviction, the person shall promptly file a written
8 notice in the underlying criminal proceeding of the person's disqualification from
9 eligibility, identifying the new conviction, including the jurisdiction, court and docket
10 number of the new criminal proceeding. If the person fails to file the required written
11 notice and the court learns of the existence of the new criminal conviction, the court
12 shall notify the person of the apparent existence of the new conviction and offer the
13 person an opportunity to request a hearing to contest the fact of a new conviction.
14 B. If the person requests a hearing under paragraph A, the court shall, after giving
15 notice to the person and the appropriate prosecutorial office, hold a hearing. At the
16 hearing, the person has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that
17 the person has not been convicted of a crime subsequent to issuance of the sealing
18 order. At the conclusion of the hearing, if the court determines that the person has not
19 satisfied the burden of proof, it shall find that the person has been newly convicted of
20 the crime and as a consequence is no longer eligible for the sealing order and shall issue
21 a written order unsealing the criminal history record information, with written findings
22 of fact. If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the court determines that the person has
23 satisfied the burden of proof, it shall find that the person has not been convicted of the
24 new crime and issue a written order certifying this determination. A copy of the court's
25 written order must be provided to the person and the prosecutorial office that
26 represented the State.
27 C. If the person does not request a hearing under paragraph A, the court shall determine
28 that the person has not satisfied the burden of proof and the court shall find that the
29 person has been convicted of the new crime and as a consequence is no longer eligible
30 for the sealing order and shall issue a written order unsealing the criminal history record
31 information, with written findings of fact. A copy of the court's written order must be
32 provided to the person and the prosecutorial office that represented the State.
33 SUMMARY
3344 This bill amends provisions of the law governing post-judgment motions to seal
3355 criminal history record information by creating a new category of criminal conviction for
3366 which a person may file a motion to seal the related criminal history record information.
3377 Under the bill, a person may file a motion to seal criminal history record information for a
3388 criminal conviction for any current or former crime if the person shows by a preponderance
3399 of the evidence that the person has been a victim of sex trafficking or sexual exploitation,
4400 as defined by the bill, and the commission of the crime for which the person was convicted
4411 was a substantial result of sex trafficking or sexual exploitation.
42 The bill also provides that a person who is regularly engaged in the business of
43 collecting, assembling, evaluating or disseminating criminal history record information
44 related to specific individuals for a fee, also called a business screening service, is required
45 to disseminate only complete and accurate records; investigate disputed records; correct or
Page 6 - 132LR2130(01)

416 delete records found to be inaccurate or reflecting a criminal conviction that was sealed or
427 pardoned; and provide a notice with disseminated records including the date the record was
438 collected and a notice that information may include criminal records that have been sealed
449 or otherwise have become inaccessible to the public. A person is considered in violation of
550 these provisions only if the person's conduct violates these provisions and also violates
561 relevant provisions of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act. A person found in violation of
572 both the state and federal law is liable to the subject of the record for a penalty of $1,000
583 and additional remedies.
