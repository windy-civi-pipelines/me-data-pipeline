TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE
_____
2025 AS TARDIVE DYSKINESIA AWARENESS WEEK
WHEREAS, serious mental illnesses like bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and
schizophrenia often require treatment with antipsychotic medications for effective
management, and antipsychotic prescribing rates continue to rise; and
WHEREAS, while prolonged antipsychotic use may be essential for the treatment of
certain conditions, it is associated with tardive dyskinesia, or "TD," a condition marked by
uncontrollable, abnormal and repetitive movements of the face, torso, limbs or extremities; and
WHEREAS, people at higher risk of TD include those older than 55 years, Black
individuals, women, individuals with mood or substance use disorders, intellectual disabilities
or central nervous system injuries and those with high cumulative antipsychotic exposure; and
WHEREAS, approximately 60% of the estimated 800,000 adults in the United States
living with TD remain undiagnosed, and even mild TD symptoms can be stigmatizing and
impair physical, social and emotional well-being, underscoring the urgency of early screening,
detection and intervention; and
WHEREAS, the American Psychiatric Association recommends routine TD screening in
their clinical guidelines for antipsychotic treatment, and individuals treated with antipsychotics
or experiencing abnormal movements should consult their healthcare providers to assess TD
risk, receive TD screenings and determine appropriate treatment together; and
WHEREAS, United States Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments for TD
can provide options for symptom management and improved quality of life for many
individuals living with TD; and
WHEREAS, the Maine Legislature can encourage TD screening education and awareness
for health care providers, patients and care partners to help ensure patients prescribed
antipsychotics receive care and support that aligns with clinical best practice, including regular
TD screenings; now, therefore, be it
RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Thirty-second Legislature
now assembled in the First Regular Session, on behalf of the people we represent, take this
opportunity to designate May 4, 2025 to May 10, 2025 as Tardive Dyskinesia Awareness
Week; acknowledge the importance of early detection and intervention to improve outcomes
for people living with mental health conditions and prescribed antipsychotics; and express our
support for efforts to raise awareness about the causes and symptoms of TD and the importance
of routine TD screening.
