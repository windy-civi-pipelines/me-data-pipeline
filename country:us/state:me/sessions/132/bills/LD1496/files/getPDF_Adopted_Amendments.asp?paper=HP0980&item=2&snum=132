27 condition, the carrier shall honor the prior authorization until the prior authorization expires
28 as long as the enrollee continues to be covered under the same health plan.
29 2. Length of prior authorization for diagnostic procedures or tests related to
30 treatment of chronic conditions. A prior authorization for a diagnostic procedure or test
31 related to the treatment of a chronic condition remains valid for subsequent, necessary

1 3. Coverage restriction prohibition; notice. A carrier may not restrict coverage for
2 a health care service, diagnostic procedure or test used in the treatment of a chronic
3 condition under this section, including coverage for a prescription, that received prior
4 authorization approval under a previous carrier within 90 days of enrollment in the carrier's
5 health plan by an enrollee if that enrollee's health care provider determines that the enrollee
6 should continue receiving that health care service, diagnostic procedure or test as
7 determined by a health care provider. The carrier shall provide the enrollee with at least 90
8 days' notice prior to restricting coverage pursuant to this subsection.
9 4. Chronic condition. For the purposes of this section, "chronic condition" means a
10 medical condition diagnosed by a health care provider that is expected to last 6 months or
11 more and that:
12 A. Requires ongoing medical attention by a health care provider to effectively manage
13 the condition or to prevent an adverse health event; or

20 prescription for the enrollee of its coverage decision within 72 hours or 2 business days,
21 whichever is less, following receipt of the request. A carrier that grants coverage under
22 this paragraph must provide coverage of the drug for the duration of the prescription,
23 including refills. A prior authorization for a prescription is valid for the duration of the
24 prescription, including refills, or for one year, whichever is longer. A carrier may not
25 require the renewal of a prior authorization more frequently than once every 3 years
26 for a prescription that continues for more than one year. The prior authorization
27 approval is valid from the date the enrollee receives notice of the approval and remains
28 valid for a prescription drug prescribed by a provider regardless of a change in dosage.
29 A carrier may rescind the prior authorization approval for prescription drug doses that
30 exceed limitations set by federal or state law, regulation or rule.

6 SUMMARY
77 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, replaces the bill and
88 changes the title. It narrows the scope of the prior authorization process required by health
99 insurance carriers to chronic conditions and removes language related to conditions
1100 requiring long-term care used in the bill. The amendment defines "chronic condition" and
1111 clarifies that the limits placed on carriers related to prior authorizations extend to health
1122 care services for the treatment of a chronic condition and to diagnostic procedures or tests
1133 related to the treatment of a chronic condition. It prohibits a carrier from requiring the
1144 renewal of a prior authorization more frequently than once every 3 years for treatment that
1155 is necessary for more than one year, instead of 5 years as proposed in the bill. Finally, the
1166 amendment removes the provision in the bill that prohibits a health care plan from
1177 restricting coverage for a health care service or a prescription that was approved under a
1188 previous health care plan within 90 days of enrollment in the new health care plan because
1199 it is duplicative of requirements in existing law. The amendment also adds an
2200 appropriations and allocations section.
