6 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
7 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
8 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
9 therefore,
10 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
11 Sec. 1. 22 MRSA ยง4008-B is enacted to read:

1 (1) If the child was not removed from the child's home by the department, 3 years

10 neglect has not been recorded.
11 C. If, during the time a prior substantiated or indicated report is recorded, a subsequent
12 substantiated or indicated report involving the same individual is entered, the records
13 of the prior report may not be sealed until the records of the subsequent report are
14 eligible for sealing under this section.

16 to the contrary, the records of a substantiated report involving the following may not
17 be sealed:
