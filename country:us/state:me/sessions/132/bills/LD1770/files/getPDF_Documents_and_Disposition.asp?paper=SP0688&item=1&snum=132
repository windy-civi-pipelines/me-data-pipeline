1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the Legislature has enacted a series of property tax relief measures in recent
4 years, including expanding the property tax fairness credit, improving the homestead
5 property tax exemption, expanding the property tax deferral program and increasing state-
6 municipal revenue sharing, in an effort to ease the burden on Maine households; and
7 Whereas, despite recent legislative efforts to provide relief, many Maine residents
8 continue to face rising property tax bills and the State remains among the states where
9 households spend a significant share of their income on property taxes, all amid broader
10 increases in the cost of living; and
11 Whereas, the State is facing a statewide housing crisis, and rising property taxes,
12 especially in high-demand areas, are making it harder for first-time home buyers and
13 working families to afford stable housing, further straining the already limited supply of
14 affordable homes; and
15 Whereas, at the same time, older Maine residents who wish to downsize or move
16 closer to services often have no affordable housing options available, forcing them to
17 remain in homes with sharply increased valuations and unaffordable property tax bills,
18 despite living on fixed incomes; and
19 Whereas, municipalities across the State, ranging from small rural towns to larger
20 cities, face varying budget pressures and responsibilities and often lack the resources,
21 staffing or technology needed to ensure accurate, equitable and up-to-date property
22 assessments; and
23 Whereas, the property tax fairness credit remains a vital tool for targeted tax relief,
24 but current benefit levels do not fully reflect today’s economic pressures or cost of living;
25 and
26 Whereas, efforts to reform the property tax system in the State have often been
27 constrained by constitutional requirements, such as the mandate that all real and personal
28 property be assessed equally according to its just value; and
29 Whereas, other states have pursued innovative strategies, including constitutional
30 reforms, to ensure effective and equitable property tax relief; and
31 Whereas, it is imperative that the State deliver immediate property tax relief and
32 launch a comprehensive, data-driven process to develop long-term solutions through a
33 representative task force; and
34 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
35 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
36 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
37 therefore,
38 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
39 Sec. 1. 36 MRSA §5219-KK, sub-§2-D, as amended by PL 2023, c. 412, Pt. S,
40 §4, is repealed and the following enacted in its place:
