S.P. 688 - L.D. 1770
Resolve, to Establish the Real Estate Property Tax Relief Task Force
Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, the Legislature has enacted a series of property tax relief measures in recent
years, including expanding the property tax fairness credit, improving the homestead
property tax exemption, expanding the property tax deferral program and increasing state-
municipal revenue sharing, in an effort to ease the burden on Maine households; and
Whereas, despite recent legislative efforts to provide relief, many Maine residents
continue to face rising property tax bills and the State remains among the states where
households spend a significant share of their income on property taxes, all amid broader
increases in the cost of living; and
Whereas, the State is facing a statewide housing crisis, and rising property taxes,
especially in high-demand areas, are making it harder for first-time home buyers and
working families to afford stable housing, further straining the already limited supply of
affordable homes; and
Whereas, at the same time, older Maine residents who wish to downsize or move
closer to services often have no affordable housing options available, forcing them to
remain in homes with sharply increased valuations and unaffordable property tax bills,
despite living on fixed incomes; and
Whereas, municipalities across the State, ranging from small rural towns to larger
cities, face varying budget pressures and responsibilities and often lack the resources,
staffing or technology needed to ensure accurate, equitable and up-to-date property
assessments; and
Whereas, the property tax fairness credit remains a vital tool for targeted tax relief,
but current benefit levels do not fully reflect todayâ€™s economic pressures or cost of living;
and
Whereas, efforts to reform the property tax system in the State have often been
constrained by constitutional requirements, such as the mandate that all real and personal
property be assessed equally according to its just value; and
Page 1 - 132LR2184(03)

Whereas, other states have pursued innovative strategies, including constitutional
reforms, to ensure effective and equitable property tax relief; and
Whereas, it is imperative that the State deliver immediate property tax relief and
launch a comprehensive, data-driven process to develop long-term solutions through a
representative task force; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore, be it
Sec. 1. Real Estate Property Tax Relief Task Force established. Resolved:
