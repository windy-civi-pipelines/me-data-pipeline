8 FIRST SPECIAL SESSION
9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to S.P. 688, L.D. 1770, “An Act to Provide
10 Immediate and Long-term Property Tax Relief to Maine Households”
11 Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following:
12 'Resolve, to Establish the Real Estate Property Tax Relief Task Force'
13 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the title and inserting the following:
14 'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
15 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
16 Whereas, the Legislature has enacted a series of property tax relief measures in recent
17 years, including expanding the property tax fairness credit, improving the homestead
18 property tax exemption, expanding the property tax deferral program and increasing state-
19 municipal revenue sharing, in an effort to ease the burden on Maine households; and
20 Whereas, despite recent legislative efforts to provide relief, many Maine residents
21 continue to face rising property tax bills and the State remains among the states where
22 households spend a significant share of their income on property taxes, all amid broader
23 increases in the cost of living; and
24 Whereas, the State is facing a statewide housing crisis, and rising property taxes,
25 especially in high-demand areas, are making it harder for first-time home buyers and
26 working families to afford stable housing, further straining the already limited supply of
27 affordable homes; and
28 Whereas, at the same time, older Maine residents who wish to downsize or move
29 closer to services often have no affordable housing options available, forcing them to
30 remain in homes with sharply increased valuations and unaffordable property tax bills,
31 despite living on fixed incomes; and
32 Whereas, municipalities across the State, ranging from small rural towns to larger
33 cities, face varying budget pressures and responsibilities and often lack the resources,

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to S.P. 688, L.D. 1770
314 staffing or technology needed to ensure accurate, equitable and up-to-date property
325 assessments; and
3 Whereas, the property tax fairness credit remains a vital tool for targeted tax relief,
4 but current benefit levels do not fully reflect today’s economic pressures or cost of living;
5 and
6 Whereas, efforts to reform the property tax system in the State have often been
7 constrained by constitutional requirements, such as the mandate that all real and personal
8 property be assessed equally according to its just value; and
9 Whereas, other states have pursued innovative strategies, including constitutional
10 reforms, to ensure effective and equitable property tax relief; and
11 Whereas, it is imperative that the State deliver immediate property tax relief and
12 launch a comprehensive, data-driven process to develop long-term solutions through a
13 representative task force; and
14 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
15 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
16 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
17 therefore, be it
18 Sec. 1. Real Estate Property Tax Relief Task Force established. Resolved:
