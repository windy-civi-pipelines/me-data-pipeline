2200 This bill changes the requirements for a new municipal charter, charter revision, charter

2222 law requires that the total number of votes cast for and against the question equals or
2233 exceeds 30% of the total votes cast in the municipality in the last gubernatorial election.
2244 The bill requires instead that the number of votes cast in favor of the question equals or
2255 exceeds 15% of the total votes cast in the municipality in the last gubernatorial election.
2266 Also, while this bill does not change the requirement that a majority of votes cast for and
2277 against the proposed change be in favor of it in order for that change to go into effect, it
2288 clarifies that blank votes are not counted in that calculation.
