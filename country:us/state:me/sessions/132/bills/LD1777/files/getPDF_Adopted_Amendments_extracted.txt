23 Title 35-A, section 3209-A. The rules must:
24 1. Require that a distributed generation resource providing service to a customer
25 participating in a net energy billing arrangement based upon a shared financial interest in
26 the distributed generation resource establish a subscription size for a customer that is based
27 on historical customer usage, while taking into account anticipated increases in usage, and
28 require a project sponsor to adjust the customer's subscription size as needed to match
29 changes in usage;
30 2. Prohibit project sponsors or operators of distributed generation resources from
31 retaining customer payment for unused kilowatt-hour credits that have expired;
32 3. For a customer participating in net energy billing, require a transmission and

1 SUMMARY
22 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, replaces the bill and
33 changes the title. The amendment does the following.
4 1. It prohibits a distributed generation resource that is interconnected to the distribution
5 grid on the grid side of a customer's meter from being used for the kilowatt-hour credit and
6 commercial and institutional net energy billing programs unless the distributed generation
7 resource reaches mechanical completion by June 1, 2026.
8 2. It requires the Governor's Energy Office to design and submit to the Public Utilities
9 Commission a proposed distributed energy resource program or programs to succeed the
10 net energy billing programs for front-of-the-meter distributed generation resources.
11 3. For both the kilowatt-hour credit and commercial and institutional net energy billing
12 programs, it requires the commission to prohibit a transmission and distribution utility from
13 entering into a net energy billing agreement with a distributed generation resource that is
14 interconnected to the distribution grid on the grid side of a customer's meter beginning on
15 the date the commission implements a distributed energy resource program to succeed the
16 net energy billing programs for front-of-the-meter distributed generation resources
17 pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3209-I.
18 4. It directs the commission to require transmission and distribution utilities to
19 reconcile costs associated with net energy billing in a rate year beginning on January 1,
20 2026.
21 5. It establishes an end date for the tariff rate received by certain distributed generation
22 resources participating in the commercial and institutional net energy billing program
23 effective January 1, 2026 and establishes new tariff rates effective January 1, 2026 that
24 apply to certain distributed generation resources participating in the commercial and
25 institutional net energy billing program.
26 6. It repeals a section of law requiring the commission to conduct competitive
27 solicitations for the procurement of energy or renewable energy credits from distributed
28 generation resources and requires instead that the commission conduct competitive
29 solicitations for the procurement of energy or renewable energy credits or both from
30 distributed generation resources participating in net energy billing for which 75% or less
31 of the bill credits associated with the resource are not allocated to a customer of or
32 subscriber to the resource.
33 7. It requires certain distributed generation resources participating in the kilowatt-hour
34 credit net energy billing program to pay a monthly fee determined by the commission that
35 must be used to offset distribution costs associated with net energy billing arrangements
36 that would otherwise be paid by ratepayers.
37 8. It requires the commission to adopt rules establishing consumer protections related
38 to the kilowatt-hour credit net energy billing program.

22 consumer protection standards for customers participating in net energy billing pursuant to
23 Title 35-A, section 3209-A. The rules must:
24 1. Require that a distributed generation resource providing service to a customer
25 participating in a net energy billing arrangement based upon a shared financial interest in
26 the distributed generation resource establish a subscription size for a customer that is based
27 on historical customer usage, while taking into account anticipated increases in usage, and
28 require a project sponsor to adjust the customer's subscription size as needed to match
29 changes in usage;
30 2. Prohibit project sponsors or operators of distributed generation resources from
31 retaining customer payment for unused kilowatt-hour credits that have expired;
32 3. For a customer participating in net energy billing, require a transmission and

34 generation resource with the customer's usage and billing information, including net energy
35 billing data needed to administer a customer's net energy billing arrangement; and
36 4. Prohibit residential customers from simultaneously participating in more than one
37 net energy billing arrangement pursuant to Title 35-A, section 3209-A, subsection 3.
38 Notwithstanding any provision of Title 35-A, section 3209-A to the contrary, rules
39 adopted by the commission pursuant to this section are routine technical rules as defined

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 1188, L.D. 1777
1 SUMMARY
22 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, replaces the bill and
33 changes the title. The amendment does the following.
4 1. It prohibits a distributed generation resource that is interconnected to the distribution
5 grid on the grid side of a customer's meter from being used for the kilowatt-hour credit and
6 commercial and institutional net energy billing programs unless the distributed generation
7 resource reaches mechanical completion by June 1, 2026.
8 2. It requires the Governor's Energy Office to design and submit to the Public Utilities
9 Commission a proposed distributed energy resource program or programs to succeed the
10 net energy billing programs for front-of-the-meter distributed generation resources.
11 3. For both the kilowatt-hour credit and commercial and institutional net energy billing
12 programs, it requires the commission to prohibit a transmission and distribution utility from
13 entering into a net energy billing agreement with a distributed generation resource that is
14 interconnected to the distribution grid on the grid side of a customer's meter beginning on
15 the date the commission implements a distributed energy resource program to succeed the
16 net energy billing programs for front-of-the-meter distributed generation resources
17 pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3209-I.
18 4. It directs the commission to require transmission and distribution utilities to
19 reconcile costs associated with net energy billing in a rate year beginning on January 1,
20 2026.
21 5. It establishes an end date for the tariff rate received by certain distributed generation
22 resources participating in the commercial and institutional net energy billing program
23 effective January 1, 2026 and establishes new tariff rates effective January 1, 2026 that
24 apply to certain distributed generation resources participating in the commercial and
25 institutional net energy billing program.
26 6. It repeals a section of law requiring the commission to conduct competitive
27 solicitations for the procurement of energy or renewable energy credits from distributed
28 generation resources and requires instead that the commission conduct competitive
29 solicitations for the procurement of energy or renewable energy credits or both from
30 distributed generation resources participating in net energy billing for which 75% or less
31 of the bill credits associated with the resource are not allocated to a customer of or
32 subscriber to the resource.
33 7. It requires certain distributed generation resources participating in the kilowatt-hour
34 credit net energy billing program to pay a monthly fee determined by the commission that
35 must be used to offset distribution costs associated with net energy billing arrangements
36 that would otherwise be paid by ratepayers.
37 8. It requires the commission to adopt rules establishing consumer protections related
38 to the kilowatt-hour credit net energy billing program.
