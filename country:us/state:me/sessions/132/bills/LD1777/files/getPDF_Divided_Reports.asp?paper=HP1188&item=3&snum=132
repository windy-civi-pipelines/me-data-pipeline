17 SUMMARY
1188 This amendment replaces the bill and changes the title. The amendment changes the
1199 limitation on the kilowatt-hour credit net energy billing program to provide that, unless a
2200 distributed generation resource has met the timing requirements established for
2211 participation in the program, after November 1, 2025, only distributed generation resources
2222 with a nameplate capacity of 500 kilowatts or less may be used for net energy billing. It
2233 also changes the definition of "net energy billing" in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title
2244 35-A, section 3209-A, subsection 1, paragraph C to provide that kilowatt-hour credits may
2255 be credited only to a customer's electricity supply charges.
26 The amendment also amends the laws governing the tariff rate and kilowatt-hour credit
27 net energy billing programs to prohibit participation 20 years from the date a net energy
28 billing agreement between the entity proposing the development of the distributed
29 generation resource and the transmission and distribution utility was executed or after
30 December 31, 2045, whichever occurs earlier. The amendment also requires that if a project
31 sponsor, owner of a distributed generation resource or other entity operating a distributed
32 generation resource with a net energy billing arrangement sells renewable energy credits
33 generated by the distributed generation resource, the renewable energy credits must be sold
34 and retired in the State.
35 The amendment clarifies that the limitations on the number of shared financial interest
36 customers or meters and the number of distributed generation resources that have net
37 energy billing arrangements in which a customer may have a financial interest apply to
38 distributed generation resources with a nameplate capacity of 500 kilowatts or less after
39 November 1, 2025.
40 The amendment also allows the Public Utilities Commission to periodically review and
41 by rule alter the amount of compensation that a customer with a financial interest in a
