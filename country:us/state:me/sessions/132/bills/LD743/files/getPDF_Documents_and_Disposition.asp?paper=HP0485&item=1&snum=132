43 subsequent to residence in the community. Any community exempted under Title 22,

414 chapter 103‑A rules adopted by the department is not entitled to and may not seek any
425 reimbursement or financial assistance under the MaineCare program from any state or
436 federal agency and, as a consequence, that community must continue to provide nursing
447 facility services to any person who has been admitted to the facility.
5 Notwithstanding this subsection, a life-care community that holds a final certificate of
6 authority from the superintendent and that was operational on November 18, 2002 and that

25 health care facilities that are directed solely at reducing energy costs through energy
26 efficiency, renewable energy technology or smart grid technology and to certify those
27 projects that are likely to be cost-effective. If a project is certified as likely to be cost-
28 effective by the trust, the review process serves as an alternative to the certificate of need
29 process established pursuant to Title 22, section 329, subsection 3.
30 Sec. 19. 38 MRSA §1310-X, sub-§4, ¶A, as amended by PL 2003, c. 551, §17, is
31 further amended to read:

37 SUMMARY
3388 Under current law, before introducing additional health care services and procedures
3399 in a market area, a person must apply for and receive a certificate of need from the
4400 Department of Health and Human Services. This bill eliminates that requirement by
4411 repealing the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, chapter 103-A, which includes sections 326
Page 9 - 132LR0865(01)

412 to 350-C, and making statutory changes to other provisions of law for consistency with the
423 repeal of chapter 103-A.
