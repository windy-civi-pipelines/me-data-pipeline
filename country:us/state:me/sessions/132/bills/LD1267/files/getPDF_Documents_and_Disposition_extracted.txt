21 compensation more accurately reflects economic output.
22 As part of its study, the task force shall review the laws and policies of other states and
23 the Federal Government and any reports or analyses regarding the effectiveness of laws
24 and policies in other jurisdictions. The study must also include an examination of the

31 3. The need for, or benefit of, requiring that employers operating in the State regularly
32 disclose to each employee the monetary value generated by that employee's labor;
33 4. The need for, or benefit of, developing a set of criteria to determine which businesses
34 will be subject to proposed reporting requirements; and
35 5. The feasibility of creating an enforceable law governing economic output and
36 wages.
