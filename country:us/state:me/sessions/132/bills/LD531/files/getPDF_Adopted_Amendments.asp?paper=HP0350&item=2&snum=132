1 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
2 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
3 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
4 therefore,
5 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
6 Sec. 1. District established; general provisions. The Toddy Pond Watershed
7 Management District, referred to in this Act as "the district," is established as a quasi-
8 municipal corporation, incorporated for the purposes described in this Act.
9 For the purposes of this Act, "participating town" means the Town of Blue Hill, the
10 Town of Orland, the Town of Penobscot or the Town of Surry, except that any town whose
11 legal voters do not approve participation in the district by a majority vote at referendum
12 pursuant to section 8, and any town that has withdrawn from the district pursuant to section
13 6, may not be considered a participating town for the purposes of this Act.
14 1. Tax exemption. The property, both real and personal, rights and franchises of the
15 district held within the boundaries of the Town of Blue Hill, the Town of Orland, the Town
16 of Penobscot and the Town of Surry are forever exempt from taxation.
17 2. Liability. The district is a governmental entity for the purposes of the Maine Tort
18 Claims Act.
19 3. Funding eligibility. The district qualifies for any grants, loans or other funding in
20 the same manner as a municipality.
21 4. Watershed district. The district is eligible for state agency assistance for watershed
22 districts as provided in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 38, section 2012.
23 5. Fiscal year. The fiscal year of the district is from July 1st to June 30th of each year.
24 Sec. 2. Governance. The affairs of the district are managed by a board of trustees,
25 referred to in this Act as "the board," made up of a combination of trustees appointed by
26 the municipal officers of the participating towns and trustees elected by the owners of the
27 waterfront properties abutting Toddy Pond, referred to in this Act as "the waterfront
28 property owners."
29 1. Membership. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the board consists of 9
30 trustees as follows:
31 A. Two trustees appointed by the municipal officers of the Town of Orland;
32 B. One trustee appointed by the municipal officers of the Town of Penobscot;
33 C. One trustee appointed by the municipal officers of the Town of Surry;
34 D. One trustee appointed by the municipal officers of the Town of Blue Hill; and
35 E. Four trustees elected by the waterfront property owners as provided in this section.
36 If the legal voters of any town do not approve participation in the district by a majority vote
37 at referendum pursuant to section 8, the trustees under this section must be adjusted in the
38 same manner as under subsection 7 as if the town was a participating town that had
39 withdrawn from the district in accordance with section 6.
40 2. Nominations for election. Candidates for election by the waterfront property
41 owners must be nominated by a lake or pond association representing at least 20% of the
Page 2 - 132LR2002(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 350, L.D. 531
412 waterfront properties abutting Toddy Pond. If no such association is in existence, the
423 nomination process is as adopted by the board.
3 3. Conduct of elections. Upon the establishment of the district, the trustees appointed
4 by the participating towns shall conduct the initial election of the trustees for the waterfront
5 property owners. The full board shall conduct elections subsequent to the initial election.
6 The election ballot must list the names of each trustee candidate and whether the candidates
7 are seeking a full term or to complete the remaining term for a vacant board seat and must
8 include any write-in candidates. Regardless of the number of actual or beneficial owners
9 of a waterfront property, a duly authorized representative of each waterfront property
10 owner may cast one vote for each open board seat listed on the election ballot. The
11 candidate or, in the event that more than one board seat is listed on the election ballot,
12 candidates who receive the most votes cast must be declared elected.
13 4. Staggered terms. The initial terms of the trustees appointed by the participating
14 towns and the trustees for the waterfront property owners must be staggered, as determined
15 by lot, with as closely as possible equal numbers of trustees serving initial terms of one
16 year, 2 years and 3 years. Subsequently appointed or elected trustees serve 3-year terms.
17 5. Vacancies. In the event a board seat occupied by a trustee appointed by the
18 municipal officers of a participating town under subsection 1 becomes vacant, the
19 municipal officers of the participating town that made the appointment to that seat may
20 appoint a replacement trustee to complete the term for that seat. In the event a board seat
21 occupied by a trustee elected by the waterfront property owners under this section becomes
22 vacant, a lake or pond association representing the greatest percentage of waterfront
23 properties abutting Toddy Pond may appoint an interim trustee to that seat until a
24 replacement trustee is elected at the next regular annual election of trustees. If the
25 association fails to appoint an interim trustee or if no such association is in existence, the
26 seat remains vacant until the next regular annual election.
27 6. Quorum; voting. A majority of the trustees appointed and elected to the board
28 must be present at a meeting of the board to constitute a quorum. The board may take an
29 action requiring a vote only upon the affirmative vote of:
30 A. A majority of the trustees appointed and elected, regardless of the number of
31 trustees present and voting at a meeting; and
32 B. At least one trustee appointed by the participating towns and at least one trustee
33 elected by the waterfront property owners.
34 7. Effect of withdrawal. If a participating town withdraws from the district in
35 accordance with section 6, the trustees appointed to represent that town must be removed
36 from the board, and the number of trustees for the waterfront property owners must be
37 reduced as necessary to ensure that, of the total number of trustees remaining, a majority
38 are town-appointed trustees, except that:
39 A. The number of trustees for the Town of Orland may not be less than one;
40 B. The number of trustees for the waterfront property owners may not be less than 2;
41 and
42 C. If all participating towns have withdrawn from the district, the number of trustees
43 for the waterfront property owners must be 3, with any additional board seats for the
Page 3 - 132LR2002(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 350, L.D. 531
414 waterfront property owners to be filled in the same manner as a vacancy for a board
425 seat for the waterfront property owners under subsection 5.
3 Any required reduction in the number of trustees for the Town of Orland or for the
4 waterfront property owners pursuant to this section must be determined by lot.
5 Sec. 3. Powers; responsibilities. The district may sue; make contracts; apply for
6 and accept grant or loan funds; accept gifts; purchase, lease, devise or otherwise acquire,
7 hold or dispose of real or personal property; disburse money; contract debt; adopt rules;
8 and do such other acts as necessary to carry out the powers and responsibilities described

16 of the district's operating and other costs and establish a lien on a waterfront property
17 in the event the waterfront property owner does not pay in full the assessed amount by
18 the date the payment is due; and
19 D. Enter into cooperative agreements with other watershed management districts,
20 municipalities and entities for the purposes of planning, operations and maintenance
21 and watershed improvement and for other purposes determined by the district.
22 2. Responsibilities. The district is responsible for:
23 A. Acquiring ownership of, owning, maintaining and operating the dam, the land under

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 350, L.D. 531
1 Sec. 4. Annual operating and capital budget. The board shall develop an annual
2 operating budget, which must include proposed appropriations into reserves for any capital
3 expenditure purpose or capital expenditure appropriations as described in this section.
4 1. Budget hearing; board approval. Prior to January 15th of each year and with
5 sufficient time to incorporate any public input, the board shall hold a public budget hearing.
6 At the budget hearing, the board shall explain the proposed budget, and residents of the
7 participating towns and the waterfront property owners must be given an opportunity to be
8 heard. At the budget hearing, only those items concerning the expenses necessary to
9 operate the district, appropriations for a reserve fund and capital expenditure are subject to
10 public input. A proposed annual budget may not be finalized and submitted for
11 appropriation to the participating towns unless approved by the board as follows:
12 A. A proposed annual budget of less than $100,000 may be finalized and approved
13 only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the trustees appointed and elected to the
14 board, regardless of the number of trustees present and voting, if at least one such
15 affirmative vote is provided by a trustee appointed by the participating towns under
16 section 2, subsection 1 and at least one such affirmative vote is provided by a trustee
17 elected by the waterfront property owners under section 2; and
18 B. A proposed annual budget of $100,000 or more may be finalized and approved only
19 by the affirmative vote of 2/3 of the trustees appointed and elected to the board,
20 regardless of the number of trustees present and voting.
21 The $100,000 budget figure in paragraphs A and B must be adjusted annually for
22 cumulative price inflation since December 31, 2024, based on the change in the Consumer
23 Price Index for All Urban Consumers, Annual City Average, for the Northeast Region, as
24 published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics or, if that
25 statistic is no longer published or available, by an alternative measure of price inflation as
26 determined by the board.
27 The board shall ensure that the final annual budget is finalized for approval no later than
28 January 15th.
29 2. Budget approval process. Upon finalization of the annual budget by the board,
30 each participating town, for consideration at a town meeting, shall incorporate a warrant
31 article as described in this section to allow the voters of the town to approve or reject the
32 budget. During the initial funding period for the district, any requests for appropriation
33 from the district may include only those amounts in excess of the amounts already
34 appropriated by a participating town at the time the district was formed.
35 The district shall provide information in print or electronic format regarding the annual
36 budget and appropriation request to each participating town prior to and at the town's
37 annual town meeting, which must include the total amounts proposed by the district for
38 each cost center summary budget category, the amount approved by the board after public
39 input gathered at the budget hearing and a summary of the total authorized expenditures
40 for the district.
41 The board shall prepare the warrant article for this purpose and shall deliver the article to
42 the municipal clerk of each participating town no later than February 1st of each year. The
43 warrant article must be in substantially the following form:
Page 5 - 132LR2002(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 350, L.D. 531
1 "Do you favor the town raising and appropriating from property tax $
2 (insert amount) to pay the town's municipal contribution to the Toddy Pond
3 Watershed Management District?"
4 3. Failure to approve municipal contribution. Each participating town's vote on the
5 warrant article determines that town's obligation to pay the municipal contribution for the
6 budgeted fiscal year. If a town fails to appropriate funds for its municipal contribution, the
7 amount not appropriated must be included in the assessment on the waterfront property
8 owners whose property is located in that town.
9 Sec. 5. Contributions; assessments. The annual budget for the district as
10 described in this Act must reflect all expected expenditures and additions to capital
11 reserves, net of any grants, donations, loans or other anticipated sources of funds. To the
12 extent that additional funds are required to balance the budget, referred to in this Act as
13 "the aggregate funds required," the participating towns and the waterfront property owners
14 shall provide funding for the aggregate funds required as follows.
15 1. Municipal contributions. If approved by the voters of the participating towns
16 pursuant to section 4, the participating towns shall provide funding for 50% of the
17 aggregate funds required, which must be determined by the board in the manner described
18 in section 4 and which must be apportioned amongst the participating towns based on the
19 following percentages: Town of Blue Hill, 6%; Town of Orland, 43%; Town of Penobscot,
20 24%; and Town of Surry, 27%. A participating town's appropriated municipal contribution
21 must be paid to the district prior to August 1st of each year.
22 2. Waterfront property owners. The waterfront property owners shall provide
23 funding for the aggregate funds required that are not provided pursuant to subsection 1,
24 which must be determined by the board as described in section 4. If a participating town,
25 or a town that has not voted to participate in the district or has withdrawn from the district,
26 fails to appropriate funds for its municipal contribution, the amount not appropriated must
27 be included in the assessment on the waterfront property owners whose property is located
28 in that town.
29 A. Each waterfront property owner shall pay an assessment proportionate to the
30 amount of shoreline frontage along Toddy Pond on that waterfront property owner's
31 lot or parcel. For the purposes of calculating this assessment, the shoreline frontage is
32 the amount used for the purposes of property tax assessment, up to a maximum of 250
33 feet of shoreline frontage, and a lot or parcel with more than 250 feet of shoreline
34 frontage must be deemed to have only 250 feet of shoreline frontage.
35 B. The district shall mail an invoice for the assessment amount due to each waterfront
36 property owner on a schedule and with a specified payment due date as determined by
37 the board. Failure to pay the assessment amount by the specified payment due date
38 incurs interest as determined by the board in a manner consistent with the Maine
39 Revised Statutes, Title 36, section 505. The district may place a lien on the lot or parcel
40 of a waterfront property owner that fails to pay the assessment amount by the specified
41 payment due date.
42 Sec. 6. Withdrawal; dissolution. The legislative body of a participating town may
43 by majority vote elect to withdraw from the district, and the board must approve the
44 withdrawal, subject to conditions and requirements reasonably necessary for the continued
45 operation of the district as may be directed by the board. If a participating town fails to
Page 6 - 132LR2002(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 350, L.D. 531
416 appropriate funds for its municipal contribution in accordance with the requirements of this
427 Act for 2 consecutive years, the town is considered to have withdrawn from the district,
438 subject to conditions and requirements reasonably necessary for the continued operation of
449 the district as may be directed by the board. The district may be dissolved upon the
550 disposition of all of its assets and settlement of any liabilities and by an affirmative vote on
561 dissolution by a majority of the trustees of the board.
7 Sec. 7. Authorized activities prior to referendum. Notwithstanding the
8 referendum requirement of section 8, the municipal officers of the Town of Blue Hill, the
9 Town of Orland, the Town of Penobscot and the Town of Surry shall prepare an estimated
10 budget for the district for its first year of operation and shall determine the aggregate funds
11 required for that year. The municipal officers of the Town of Blue Hill, the Town of
12 Orland, the Town of Penobscot and the Town of Surry shall determine the required
13 municipal contributions for each town, which must represent 50% of those aggregate funds
14 required, and which must be apportioned amongst the towns based on the following
15 percentages: Town of Blue Hill, 6%; Town of Orland, 43%; Town of Penobscot, 24%; and
16 Town of Surry, 27%. The municipal contribution amount determined for each town
17 pursuant to this section must be used for the purposes of the referendum required in section
18 8.
19 Sec. 8. Emergency clause; referendum; effective date. In view of the
20 emergency cited in the preamble, this Act takes effect when approved only for the purposes
21 of allowing the municipal officers of the Town of Blue Hill, the Town of Orland, the Town
22 of Penobscot and the Town of Surry to prepare an estimated budget and determine the
23 aggregate funds required and required municipal contribution pursuant to section 7 and for
24 permitting the Act's submission to the legal voters of the Town of Blue Hill, the Town of
25 Orland, the Town of Penobscot and the Town of Surry at a referendum called for that
26 purpose and held after June 1, 2025 but within 2 years after the effective date of this Act.
27 Each referendum must be called by the municipal officers of the respective towns and must
28 be held at the regular voting places. The referendum must be called, advertised and
29 conducted according to the law relating to municipal elections. For the purpose of
30 registration of voters, the registrars of voters must be in session the regular workday
31 preceding the referendum. The subject matter of this Act must be reduced to a question in
32 substantially the following form:
33 "Do you favor the establishment of and the town's participation in the
34 Toddy Pond Watershed Management District and the appropriation of $
35 (insert amount) to provide the town's share of the estimated budget for the
36 first year of operation of the Toddy Pond Watershed Management
37 District?"
38 The voters shall indicate by a cross or check mark placed against the word "Yes" or
39 "No" their opinion of the same.
40 The results must be declared by the municipal officers of the Town of Blue Hill, the
41 Town of Orland, the Town of Penobscot and the Town of Surry and due certificate of the
42 results filed by the clerk with the Secretary of State.
43 This Act takes effect for all other purposes immediately upon its approval by a majority
44 of the legal voters of one or more of the towns voting at the referendum. A town that fails
45 to achieve the necessary approval in any referendum pursuant to this section may not be
Page 7 - 132LR2002(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 350, L.D. 531
416 considered a participating town for the purposes of this Act but is not prohibited from
427 conducting subsequent referenda consistent with this section as long as the referenda are
438 held within 2 years after the effective date of this Act.
4 For any period that a town is not considered a participating town for the purposes of
5 this Act as a result of a failure to achieve the necessary approval in any referendum pursuant
6 to this section, the municipal contribution required for that town must be assessed on the
7 waterfront property owners whose property is located in that town in accordance with
8 section 5, subsection 2.'
9 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section
10 number to read consecutively.
11 SUMMARY
1122 This amendment replaces the bill, which is a concept draft, and changes the title.
1133 Subject to approval by the voters at referendum conducted by at least one of the Town of
1144 Orland, the Town of Penobscot, the Town of Blue Hill and the Town of Surry, the
1155 amendment establishes the Toddy Pond Watershed Management District for the purposes
1166 of acquiring ownership of, owning, maintaining and operating the dam on Toddy Pond and
1177 engaging in other related activities. The costs of operations of the Toddy Pond Watershed
1188 Management District are to be funded as follows: 50% of the costs by municipal
1199 contribution from the Town of Orland, the Town of Penobscot, the Town of Blue Hill and

26 municipality is significantly time-limited to 180 days after the date a petition for release
27 from dam ownership is filed by the dam owner, with the opportunity for one extension of
28 180 days following that initial period; and
29 Whereas, the watershed management district established in this legislation is
30 designed to assume ownership of the dam on Toddy Pond and to subsequently maintain
31 and operate that dam, including coordinating water level management, on Toddy Pond; and
32 Whereas, the watershed management district must therefore be established prior to
33 the expiration of the statutory period in Title 38, section 902 to effectuate and implement
34 the municipal consultation procedure; and

1 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
2 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
3 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
4 therefore,
5 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
6 Sec. 1. District established; general provisions. The Toddy Pond Watershed
7 Management District, referred to in this Act as "the district," is established as a quasi-
8 municipal corporation, incorporated for the purposes described in this Act.
9 For the purposes of this Act, "participating town" means the Town of Blue Hill, the
10 Town of Orland, the Town of Penobscot or the Town of Surry, except that any town whose
11 legal voters do not approve participation in the district by a majority vote at referendum
12 pursuant to section 8, and any town that has withdrawn from the district pursuant to section
13 6, may not be considered a participating town for the purposes of this Act.
14 1. Tax exemption. The property, both real and personal, rights and franchises of the
15 district held within the boundaries of the Town of Blue Hill, the Town of Orland, the Town
16 of Penobscot and the Town of Surry are forever exempt from taxation.
17 2. Liability. The district is a governmental entity for the purposes of the Maine Tort
18 Claims Act.
19 3. Funding eligibility. The district qualifies for any grants, loans or other funding in
20 the same manner as a municipality.
21 4. Watershed district. The district is eligible for state agency assistance for watershed
22 districts as provided in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 38, section 2012.
23 5. Fiscal year. The fiscal year of the district is from July 1st to June 30th of each year.
24 Sec. 2. Governance. The affairs of the district are managed by a board of trustees,
25 referred to in this Act as "the board," made up of a combination of trustees appointed by
26 the municipal officers of the participating towns and trustees elected by the owners of the
27 waterfront properties abutting Toddy Pond, referred to in this Act as "the waterfront
28 property owners."
29 1. Membership. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the board consists of 9
30 trustees as follows:
31 A. Two trustees appointed by the municipal officers of the Town of Orland;
32 B. One trustee appointed by the municipal officers of the Town of Penobscot;
33 C. One trustee appointed by the municipal officers of the Town of Surry;
34 D. One trustee appointed by the municipal officers of the Town of Blue Hill; and
35 E. Four trustees elected by the waterfront property owners as provided in this section.
36 If the legal voters of any town do not approve participation in the district by a majority vote
37 at referendum pursuant to section 8, the trustees under this section must be adjusted in the
38 same manner as under subsection 7 as if the town was a participating town that had
39 withdrawn from the district in accordance with section 6.
40 2. Nominations for election. Candidates for election by the waterfront property
41 owners must be nominated by a lake or pond association representing at least 20% of the
Page 2 - 132LR2002(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 350, L.D. 531
412 waterfront properties abutting Toddy Pond. If no such association is in existence, the
423 nomination process is as adopted by the board.
3 3. Conduct of elections. Upon the establishment of the district, the trustees appointed
4 by the participating towns shall conduct the initial election of the trustees for the waterfront
5 property owners. The full board shall conduct elections subsequent to the initial election.
6 The election ballot must list the names of each trustee candidate and whether the candidates
7 are seeking a full term or to complete the remaining term for a vacant board seat and must
8 include any write-in candidates. Regardless of the number of actual or beneficial owners
9 of a waterfront property, a duly authorized representative of each waterfront property
10 owner may cast one vote for each open board seat listed on the election ballot. The
11 candidate or, in the event that more than one board seat is listed on the election ballot,
12 candidates who receive the most votes cast must be declared elected.
13 4. Staggered terms. The initial terms of the trustees appointed by the participating
14 towns and the trustees for the waterfront property owners must be staggered, as determined
15 by lot, with as closely as possible equal numbers of trustees serving initial terms of one
16 year, 2 years and 3 years. Subsequently appointed or elected trustees serve 3-year terms.
17 5. Vacancies. In the event a board seat occupied by a trustee appointed by the
18 municipal officers of a participating town under subsection 1 becomes vacant, the
19 municipal officers of the participating town that made the appointment to that seat may
20 appoint a replacement trustee to complete the term for that seat. In the event a board seat
21 occupied by a trustee elected by the waterfront property owners under this section becomes
22 vacant, a lake or pond association representing the greatest percentage of waterfront
23 properties abutting Toddy Pond may appoint an interim trustee to that seat until a
24 replacement trustee is elected at the next regular annual election of trustees. If the
25 association fails to appoint an interim trustee or if no such association is in existence, the
26 seat remains vacant until the next regular annual election.
27 6. Quorum; voting. A majority of the trustees appointed and elected to the board
28 must be present at a meeting of the board to constitute a quorum. The board may take an
29 action requiring a vote only upon the affirmative vote of:
30 A. A majority of the trustees appointed and elected, regardless of the number of
31 trustees present and voting at a meeting; and
32 B. At least one trustee appointed by the participating towns and at least one trustee
33 elected by the waterfront property owners.
34 7. Effect of withdrawal. If a participating town withdraws from the district in
35 accordance with section 6, the trustees appointed to represent that town must be removed
36 from the board, and the number of trustees for the waterfront property owners must be
37 reduced as necessary to ensure that, of the total number of trustees remaining, a majority
38 are town-appointed trustees, except that:
39 A. The number of trustees for the Town of Orland may not be less than one;
40 B. The number of trustees for the waterfront property owners may not be less than 2;
41 and
42 C. If all participating towns have withdrawn from the district, the number of trustees
43 for the waterfront property owners must be 3, with any additional board seats for the
Page 3 - 132LR2002(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 350, L.D. 531
414 waterfront property owners to be filled in the same manner as a vacancy for a board
425 seat for the waterfront property owners under subsection 5.
3 Any required reduction in the number of trustees for the Town of Orland or for the
4 waterfront property owners pursuant to this section must be determined by lot.
5 Sec. 3. Powers; responsibilities. The district may sue; make contracts; apply for
6 and accept grant or loan funds; accept gifts; purchase, lease, devise or otherwise acquire,
7 hold or dispose of real or personal property; disburse money; contract debt; adopt rules;
8 and do such other acts as necessary to carry out the powers and responsibilities described

14 fund a portion of the district's operating and other costs;
15 C. Levy and collect an assessment on the waterfront property owners to fund a portion
16 of the district's operating and other costs and establish a lien on a waterfront property
17 in the event the waterfront property owner does not pay in full the assessed amount by
18 the date the payment is due; and
19 D. Enter into cooperative agreements with other watershed management districts,
20 municipalities and entities for the purposes of planning, operations and maintenance
21 and watershed improvement and for other purposes determined by the district.
22 2. Responsibilities. The district is responsible for:
23 A. Acquiring ownership of, owning, maintaining and operating the dam, the land under

1 Sec. 4. Annual operating and capital budget. The board shall develop an annual
2 operating budget, which must include proposed appropriations into reserves for any capital
3 expenditure purpose or capital expenditure appropriations as described in this section.
4 1. Budget hearing; board approval. Prior to January 15th of each year and with
5 sufficient time to incorporate any public input, the board shall hold a public budget hearing.
6 At the budget hearing, the board shall explain the proposed budget, and residents of the
7 participating towns and the waterfront property owners must be given an opportunity to be
8 heard. At the budget hearing, only those items concerning the expenses necessary to
9 operate the district, appropriations for a reserve fund and capital expenditure are subject to
10 public input. A proposed annual budget may not be finalized and submitted for
11 appropriation to the participating towns unless approved by the board as follows:
12 A. A proposed annual budget of less than $100,000 may be finalized and approved
13 only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the trustees appointed and elected to the
14 board, regardless of the number of trustees present and voting, if at least one such
15 affirmative vote is provided by a trustee appointed by the participating towns under
16 section 2, subsection 1 and at least one such affirmative vote is provided by a trustee
17 elected by the waterfront property owners under section 2; and
18 B. A proposed annual budget of $100,000 or more may be finalized and approved only
19 by the affirmative vote of 2/3 of the trustees appointed and elected to the board,
20 regardless of the number of trustees present and voting.
21 The $100,000 budget figure in paragraphs A and B must be adjusted annually for
22 cumulative price inflation since December 31, 2024, based on the change in the Consumer
23 Price Index for All Urban Consumers, Annual City Average, for the Northeast Region, as
24 published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics or, if that
25 statistic is no longer published or available, by an alternative measure of price inflation as
26 determined by the board.
27 The board shall ensure that the final annual budget is finalized for approval no later than
28 January 15th.
29 2. Budget approval process. Upon finalization of the annual budget by the board,
30 each participating town, for consideration at a town meeting, shall incorporate a warrant
31 article as described in this section to allow the voters of the town to approve or reject the
32 budget. During the initial funding period for the district, any requests for appropriation
33 from the district may include only those amounts in excess of the amounts already
34 appropriated by a participating town at the time the district was formed.
35 The district shall provide information in print or electronic format regarding the annual
36 budget and appropriation request to each participating town prior to and at the town's
37 annual town meeting, which must include the total amounts proposed by the district for
38 each cost center summary budget category, the amount approved by the board after public
39 input gathered at the budget hearing and a summary of the total authorized expenditures
40 for the district.
41 The board shall prepare the warrant article for this purpose and shall deliver the article to
42 the municipal clerk of each participating town no later than February 1st of each year. The
43 warrant article must be in substantially the following form:
Page 5 - 132LR2002(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 350, L.D. 531
1 "Do you favor the town raising and appropriating from property tax $
2 (insert amount) to pay the town's municipal contribution to the Toddy Pond
3 Watershed Management District?"
4 3. Failure to approve municipal contribution. Each participating town's vote on the
5 warrant article determines that town's obligation to pay the municipal contribution for the
6 budgeted fiscal year. If a town fails to appropriate funds for its municipal contribution, the
7 amount not appropriated must be included in the assessment on the waterfront property
8 owners whose property is located in that town.
9 Sec. 5. Contributions; assessments. The annual budget for the district as
10 described in this Act must reflect all expected expenditures and additions to capital
11 reserves, net of any grants, donations, loans or other anticipated sources of funds. To the
12 extent that additional funds are required to balance the budget, referred to in this Act as
13 "the aggregate funds required," the participating towns and the waterfront property owners
14 shall provide funding for the aggregate funds required as follows.
15 1. Municipal contributions. If approved by the voters of the participating towns
16 pursuant to section 4, the participating towns shall provide funding for 50% of the
17 aggregate funds required, which must be determined by the board in the manner described
18 in section 4 and which must be apportioned amongst the participating towns based on the
19 following percentages: Town of Blue Hill, 6%; Town of Orland, 43%; Town of Penobscot,
20 24%; and Town of Surry, 27%. A participating town's appropriated municipal contribution
21 must be paid to the district prior to August 1st of each year.
22 2. Waterfront property owners. The waterfront property owners shall provide
23 funding for the aggregate funds required that are not provided pursuant to subsection 1,
24 which must be determined by the board as described in section 4. If a participating town,
25 or a town that has not voted to participate in the district or has withdrawn from the district,
26 fails to appropriate funds for its municipal contribution, the amount not appropriated must
27 be included in the assessment on the waterfront property owners whose property is located
28 in that town.
29 A. Each waterfront property owner shall pay an assessment proportionate to the
30 amount of shoreline frontage along Toddy Pond on that waterfront property owner's
31 lot or parcel. For the purposes of calculating this assessment, the shoreline frontage is
32 the amount used for the purposes of property tax assessment, up to a maximum of 250
33 feet of shoreline frontage, and a lot or parcel with more than 250 feet of shoreline
34 frontage must be deemed to have only 250 feet of shoreline frontage.
35 B. The district shall mail an invoice for the assessment amount due to each waterfront
36 property owner on a schedule and with a specified payment due date as determined by
37 the board. Failure to pay the assessment amount by the specified payment due date
38 incurs interest as determined by the board in a manner consistent with the Maine
39 Revised Statutes, Title 36, section 505. The district may place a lien on the lot or parcel
40 of a waterfront property owner that fails to pay the assessment amount by the specified
41 payment due date.
42 Sec. 6. Withdrawal; dissolution. The legislative body of a participating town may
43 by majority vote elect to withdraw from the district, and the board must approve the
44 withdrawal, subject to conditions and requirements reasonably necessary for the continued
45 operation of the district as may be directed by the board. If a participating town fails to
Page 6 - 132LR2002(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 350, L.D. 531
416 appropriate funds for its municipal contribution in accordance with the requirements of this
427 Act for 2 consecutive years, the town is considered to have withdrawn from the district,
438 subject to conditions and requirements reasonably necessary for the continued operation of
449 the district as may be directed by the board. The district may be dissolved upon the
550 disposition of all of its assets and settlement of any liabilities and by an affirmative vote on
561 dissolution by a majority of the trustees of the board.
7 Sec. 7. Authorized activities prior to referendum. Notwithstanding the
8 referendum requirement of section 8, the municipal officers of the Town of Blue Hill, the
9 Town of Orland, the Town of Penobscot and the Town of Surry shall prepare an estimated
10 budget for the district for its first year of operation and shall determine the aggregate funds
11 required for that year. The municipal officers of the Town of Blue Hill, the Town of
12 Orland, the Town of Penobscot and the Town of Surry shall determine the required
13 municipal contributions for each town, which must represent 50% of those aggregate funds
14 required, and which must be apportioned amongst the towns based on the following
15 percentages: Town of Blue Hill, 6%; Town of Orland, 43%; Town of Penobscot, 24%; and
16 Town of Surry, 27%. The municipal contribution amount determined for each town
17 pursuant to this section must be used for the purposes of the referendum required in section
18 8.
19 Sec. 8. Emergency clause; referendum; effective date. In view of the
20 emergency cited in the preamble, this Act takes effect when approved only for the purposes
21 of allowing the municipal officers of the Town of Blue Hill, the Town of Orland, the Town
22 of Penobscot and the Town of Surry to prepare an estimated budget and determine the
23 aggregate funds required and required municipal contribution pursuant to section 7 and for
24 permitting the Act's submission to the legal voters of the Town of Blue Hill, the Town of
25 Orland, the Town of Penobscot and the Town of Surry at a referendum called for that
26 purpose and held after June 1, 2025 but within 2 years after the effective date of this Act.
27 Each referendum must be called by the municipal officers of the respective towns and must
28 be held at the regular voting places. The referendum must be called, advertised and
29 conducted according to the law relating to municipal elections. For the purpose of
30 registration of voters, the registrars of voters must be in session the regular workday
31 preceding the referendum. The subject matter of this Act must be reduced to a question in
32 substantially the following form:
33 "Do you favor the establishment of and the town's participation in the
34 Toddy Pond Watershed Management District and the appropriation of $
35 (insert amount) to provide the town's share of the estimated budget for the
36 first year of operation of the Toddy Pond Watershed Management
37 District?"
38 The voters shall indicate by a cross or check mark placed against the word "Yes" or
39 "No" their opinion of the same.
40 The results must be declared by the municipal officers of the Town of Blue Hill, the
41 Town of Orland, the Town of Penobscot and the Town of Surry and due certificate of the
42 results filed by the clerk with the Secretary of State.
43 This Act takes effect for all other purposes immediately upon its approval by a majority
44 of the legal voters of one or more of the towns voting at the referendum. A town that fails
45 to achieve the necessary approval in any referendum pursuant to this section may not be
Page 7 - 132LR2002(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 350, L.D. 531
416 considered a participating town for the purposes of this Act but is not prohibited from
427 conducting subsequent referenda consistent with this section as long as the referenda are
438 held within 2 years after the effective date of this Act.
4 For any period that a town is not considered a participating town for the purposes of
5 this Act as a result of a failure to achieve the necessary approval in any referendum pursuant
6 to this section, the municipal contribution required for that town must be assessed on the
7 waterfront property owners whose property is located in that town in accordance with
8 section 5, subsection 2.'
9 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section
10 number to read consecutively.
11 SUMMARY
1122 This amendment replaces the bill, which is a concept draft, and changes the title.
1133 Subject to approval by the voters at referendum conducted by at least one of the Town of
1144 Orland, the Town of Penobscot, the Town of Blue Hill and the Town of Surry, the
1155 amendment establishes the Toddy Pond Watershed Management District for the purposes
1166 of acquiring ownership of, owning, maintaining and operating the dam on Toddy Pond and
