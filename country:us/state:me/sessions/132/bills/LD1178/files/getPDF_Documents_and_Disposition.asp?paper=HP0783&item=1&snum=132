55 This bill decreases from 30 to 15 working days the period for the Department of Health
66 and Human Services to determine if a municipality has illegally moved an individual to
77 avoid responsibility for general assistance support. The bill reduces the appeals period
88 from 30 to 15 days after the determination is made. The bill also provides for interest on
99 unreimbursed amounts to be paid by the offending municipality and a penalty of up to
1100 $10,000 for a repeat violation within a 12-month period and creates the rebuttable
1111 presumption that if a municipality moves a person to another municipality, the municipality
1122 did so to avoid paying general assistance to that person.
