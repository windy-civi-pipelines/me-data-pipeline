the number allowed by law in order to test the ability of the electronic tabulating equipment
to reject those votes. In this test, valid votes must be assigned to each candidate for an
office and for and against each measure. If any error is detected, the cause for the error
must be ascertained and corrected and an errorless count must be made and certified by the
clerk before the polls open on election day. The test ballots, the hand tally and the tapes
generated as a result of the tests must be packed and sealed in a container labeled "Test
Ballots." The container must remain sealed for at least 2 months after the election, unless
needed for recount purposes. The tests provided for in this section must be open to the
public.

that enacts the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 21-A, section 308 to valid requests received
by the Secretary of State after January 1, 2024.
