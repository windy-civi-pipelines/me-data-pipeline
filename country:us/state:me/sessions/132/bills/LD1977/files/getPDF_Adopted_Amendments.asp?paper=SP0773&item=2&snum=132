22 SUMMARY
2233 This amendment makes the following changes to the bill.
24 1. It removes the provision that the digital cast vote record is confidential, except that,
25 in an election determined by ranked-choice voting, the digital cast vote record becomes a
26 public record at the time the Secretary of State completes the tabulation of the vote.
27 2. It adds online voter registration to the types of voter registration methods that do not
28 require notice within the 30 days before an election that the registrar might not receive the
29 application before the closed period, but that the applicant may register in person any time
30 before the close of the polls on election day.
31 3. It removes the provision that authorizes the Secretary of State to provisionally
32 designate additional agencies as voter registration agencies, subject to the requirement that
33 the Secretary of State submit draft legislation to the Legislature adding the provisionally
34 designated agency to the list of designated agencies.
35 4. It adds a reference to the required fee that a person must pay in order to purchase a
36 voter file from the Department of the Secretary of State to evaluate, monitor or seek
37 compliance with the laws relating to voting rights, election administration and voter
38 registration.
39 5. It removes the term "next election cycle," which is not defined, from the provision

411 of the time frame for filing written notice as "by December 31st of the year of the next
422 general election following disqualification."
3 6. It amends the provision allowing a qualified party to voluntarily dissolve to clarify
4 that a written request filed with the Secretary of State and signed by the statewide chair
5 may come only following an affirmative vote by the party's state committee to relinquish
6 its qualified or qualifying status. For a party without a state committee, the written request
7 must be signed by an authorized representative of the party.
8 7. It amends the provision allowing parties to permit unenrolled voters to sign the
9 parties' candidates' primary nomination petitions after filing a notice with the Secretary of
10 State that the notice may be only filed following an affirmative vote by the party's state
11 committee. For a party without a state committee, the determination must be made through
12 an authorized representative of the party.
13 8. It amends, rather than repeals, the provision requiring the Secretary of State to
14 implement a system for collecting and logging concerns from members of the public
15 regarding the conduct of elections to clarify that the system is for collecting and logging
16 reports from residents of this State of alleged violations of the Maine Revised Statutes,
17 Title 21-A related to the conduct of statewide or federal elections. The amendment specifies
18 that the reported alleged violations must be categorized and that the log must include any
19 action taken to address the alleged violations, if applicable. It also adjusts, rather than
20 repeals, the reporting of this information in the report submitted to the joint standing
21 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over elections matters every 2 years.
