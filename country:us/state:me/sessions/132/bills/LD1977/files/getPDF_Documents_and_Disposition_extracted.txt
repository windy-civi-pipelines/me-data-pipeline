13 ruling complained of, a statement of the grounds upon which the decision, order or

24 Justice determines proper.

37 may allow, a specification of errors claimed to have been made by the Secretary of
38 State in the amended decision or order, and the specification of errors must be
39 considered by the court in addition to the errors asserted in the original complaint
40 on appeal. Upon granting a motion to take additional evidence, the court shall
41 establish deadlines that allow for final disposition of the appeal within 35 days of

40 to record a predetermined number of valid votes for each candidate and on each measure.
41 In the presence of one or more witnesses, the clerk shall clearly mark each ballot used for
42 testing with the word "TEST" across the front side of the ballot in black or blue red indelible
43 ink. The test must include one or more ballots that have votes for each office in excess of
Page 20 - 132LR0564(01)
414 the number allowed by law in order to test the ability of the electronic tabulating equipment
425 to reject those votes. In this test, valid votes must be assigned to each candidate for an
436 office and for and against each measure. If any error is detected, the cause for the error
447 must be ascertained and corrected and an errorless count must be made and certified by the
458 clerk before the polls open on election day. The test ballots, the hand tally and the tapes
469 generated as a result of the tests must be packed and sealed in a container labeled "Test
570 Ballots." The container must remain sealed for at least 2 months after the election, unless
581 needed for recount purposes. The tests provided for in this section must be open to the

10 Sec. 60. Retroactivity. The Secretary of State may apply that section of this Act
11 that enacts the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 21-A, section 308 to valid requests received
12 by the Secretary of State after January 1, 2024.
13 SUMMARY
1144 This bill makes the following changes to the election laws.
15 1. It replaces uses of "polling place" in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 21-A with the
16 defined term "voting place."
17 2. It amends the definition of "closed period" to make it consistent with the statutory
18 provision allowing a voter to register to vote in an election through automatic voter
19 registration within a portion of the closed period.
20 3. It provides that the digital cast vote record is confidential, except that, in an election
21 determined by ranked-choice voting, the digital cast vote record becomes a public record
22 at the time the Secretary of State completes the tabulation of the vote.
23 4. It changes the deadline for submitting an online voter registration application from
24 midnight on the 21st day before election day to 5 p.m. on the 21st day before election day.
25 5. It makes nonsubstantive revisions to Title 21-A, sections 121 and 121-A, relating to
26 voter registration procedures, to improve clarity and readability. It also adjusts the
27 deadlines for the Secretary of State to transfer voter registration applications received from
28 outside agencies, imposing differing deadlines depending on how close to election day the
29 application is received.
30 6. It requires registrars to treat changes and withdrawals of enrollment as filed on the
31 15th day before the election if the 15th day before the election is a holiday and the change
32 or withdrawal of enrollment form is filed on the next business day after the holiday.
33 7. It designates new agencies as outside voter registration agencies, clarifies which
34 programs within those agencies must provide voter registration services and authorizes the
35 Secretary of State to provisionally designate additional agencies as voter registration
36 agencies, subject to the requirement that the Secretary of State submit draft legislation to
37 the Legislature adding the provisionally designated agency to the list of designated
38 agencies.
39 8. It amends the provision governing use of central voter registration data by clarifying
40 the permitted uses of voter data for purposes of evaluating, monitoring or seeking
41 compliance with certain laws, designating certain types of data as highly sensitive,
Page 21 - 132LR0564(01)
412 removing certain prohibitions on transfer or publication of central voter registration data
423 and specifying new civil violations for certain misuses of central voter registration data.
3 9. It enacts provisions governing treatment of qualifying and qualified political parties
4 that fail to attain or lose qualified status. The provisions allow for immediate disenrollment
5 of voters who enrolled in an unsuccessful qualifying party while allowing established
6 parties that are disqualified to retain their enrolled voters by filing a notice for up to one
7 full election cycle while they seek to enroll additional voters to reach the enrollment
8 threshold necessary for qualified status.
9 10. It creates a new process allowing a qualified party to voluntarily dissolve by filing
10 a notice with the Secretary of State. It gives this provision retroactive effect to January 1,
11 2024, allowing the Secretary of State to act on notices of dissolution received after that
12 date.
13 11. It permits parties to elect to allow unenrolled voters to sign their candidates' primary
14 nomination petitions by filing a notice with the Secretary of State.
15 12. It requires municipalities to make a municipal officer available to certify names on
16 candidate petitions on the day that primary petitions are due to the Secretary of State.
17 13. It clarifies that the Secretary of State may not accept a candidate consent form
18 unless it contains the required certification by the registrar of the candidate's enrollment.
19 14. It clarifies that the Secretary of State must accept party and nonparty candidate
20 petitions if they contain more than the maximum permitted number of valid signatures, but
21 that the Secretary of State may not validate those signatures above the maximum.
22 15. It provides for direct appeals to the Law Court from a decision by the Secretary of
23 State to validate or invalidate a party or nonparty candidate petition in response to a
24 challenge.
25 16. It enacts a new provision allowing for substitution of party-nominated presidential
26 electors if a nominated elector dies, withdraws or becomes disqualified before the election.
27 17. It creates an exception to the requirement of holding a primary election as part of
28 the process to fill a vacancy in the office of representative to Congress if the United States
29 Speaker of the House of Representatives invokes a federal law requiring expedited election
30 procedures if there are more than 100 vacancies in the United States House of
31 Representatives.
32 18. It requires a candidate wishing for the candidate's name to appear differently on the
33 ballot than it does on their candidate consent form to notify the Secretary of State no later
34 than 70 days prior to the election.
35 19. It allows the Secretary of State to prepare neutral instruction materials and posters
36 for posting at the voting place to the extent the Secretary of State determines them to be
37 necessary to assist voters.
38 20. It repeals requirements that the Secretary of State produce and disseminate a guide
39 to election law and conduct a training program for new municipal clerks.
40 21. It repeals the requirement that the Secretary of State implement a system for
41 collecting and logging concerns from members of the public regarding the conduct of
42 elections.
Page 22 - 132LR0564(01)
1 22. It requires a municipal clerk to post or have posted a notice of election, attested by
2 the clerk, in a conspicuous public place in a municipality at least 21 days immediately
3 before election day and at each voting place in the municipality on election day.
4 23. It changes the deadlines from 60 days before the election to 90 days before the
5 election for a municipality to request approval of a new voting place and for a party to file
6 a complaint concerning the size of an existing voting place.
7 24. It clarifies that the restrictions on certain advertising at the voting place and on
8 public property within 250 feet of the entrance of the voting place on election day include
9 apparel.
10 25. It clarifies that wardens may limit or disallow signature gathering at the voting
11 place as may be necessary to prevent violations of the ban on certain political activities at
12 the polls.
13 26. It prohibits any person other than an authorized municipal official to distribute or
14 collect voter registration applications inside the voting place or on public property within
15 250 feet of the entrance of the voting place on election day.
16 27. It consolidates into one new section several existing provisions regulating activities
17 at the voting place on election day, including pollwatching, signature gathering, charitable
18 activities and election observing.
19 28. It clarifies that a declared write-in candidate for President must file consent forms
20 for each of the presidential electors with the Secretary of State no later than 5 p.m. on the
21 70th day before the election.
22 29. It changes the deadline by which municipal clerks must make absentee ballot
23 applications available for primary elections from 3 months before the election to 2 months
24 before the election.
25 30. It amends the provision identifying the facilities subject to in-facility absentee
26 voting to include mental health residential facilities, residential facilities for individuals
27 with intellectual disabilities and state mental health institutes.
28 31. It allows municipalities that receive multiple requests for public inspection of
29 absentee ballots before processing, either on election day or in the 7 days before election
30 day, to reasonably limit the time and manner of public inspection and give priority to
31 authorized representatives of parties and candidates.
32 32. It clarifies that a vote for a write-in candidate for President is attributable to that
33 candidate's designated presidential electors.
34 33. It makes various changes to the provisions governing the electoral college to
35 conform to the federal Electoral Count Reform Act. It clarifies that the Governor must
36 issue the certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors no later than 6 days before
37 the meeting of electors. It also provides, in accordance with the Electoral Count Reform
38 Act, that the meeting of electors must happen on the Tuesday after the 2nd Wednesday in
39 December following their election. It specifies that the certificate of ascertainment of
40 appointment of electors must contain a security feature selected by the Secretary of State
41 in addition to the state seal.
42 34. It eliminates language governing the use of electronic tabulators providing for
43 secrecy envelopes for ballots.
Page 23 - 132LR0564(01)
1 35. It changes the format and updates certain language of the provision governing
2 closing of voting places that use electronic tabulators.
3 36. It provides that test ballots used to test electronic tabulating equipment must be
4 marked in red ink rather than blue or black ink.

1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 21-A MRSA §1, sub-§10, as enacted by PL 1985, c. 161, §6, is amended
3 to read:
4 10. Closed period. "Closed period" means that time period when the registrar may

7 Sec. 2. 21-A MRSA §22, sub-§8 is enacted to read:
8 8. Digital cast vote record. The digital cast vote record is confidential, except that,
9 in an election determined by ranked-choice voting, the digital cast vote record becomes a
10 public record at the time the Secretary of State completes the tabulation of the vote.
11 Sec. 3. 21-A MRSA §121, sub-§1-A, as amended by PL 2023, c. 291, §1 and

12 observation of the public. The following procedures must be followed.
13 A. The warden shall run the official tally tape from each electronic tabulating device
14 and shall record the total votes from the tape on the tally sheet provided by the
15 Secretary of State. The official tally tape must be signed by the warden and one

19 the tally sheets and the return of votes cast and may run additional copies of the tally
20 tape to post for public review.
21 B. All unused ballots must be packaged and sealed pursuant to section 698, subsection
22 2‑B for return to the municipal clerk.
23 C. The ballot box for the electronic voting device must be opened at the voting place
24 and regular counted ballots placed in the tamper-proof ballot boxes.
25 D. All unread ballots requiring hand counting or ballots containing write-in votes that
26 must be recorded on a tally sheet are counted by the election clerks and the tally sheets
27 must be completed pursuant to section 695. If it appears that any ballot is damaged so
28 that it cannot be properly counted by the electronic tabulating device, the ballot must
29 be counted manually.
30 E. The election officials shall complete and sign the other election forms as provided
31 in this Title and shall return the ballots and other materials to the clerk packed pursuant

35 to read:
36 §854. Test of electronic tabulating equipment
37 The clerk shall have the electronic tabulating equipment tested prior to the polls
38 opening to ascertain that it accurately counts the votes cast for all offices and on all
39 measures. The test must be conducted by processing a preaudited group of ballots marked
40 to record a predetermined number of valid votes for each candidate and on each measure.
41 In the presence of one or more witnesses, the clerk shall clearly mark each ballot used for
42 testing with the word "TEST" across the front side of the ballot in black or blue red indelible
43 ink. The test must include one or more ballots that have votes for each office in excess of
Page 20 - 132LR0564(01)

414 the number allowed by law in order to test the ability of the electronic tabulating equipment
425 to reject those votes. In this test, valid votes must be assigned to each candidate for an
436 office and for and against each measure. If any error is detected, the cause for the error
447 must be ascertained and corrected and an errorless count must be made and certified by the
458 clerk before the polls open on election day. The test ballots, the hand tally and the tapes
469 generated as a result of the tests must be packed and sealed in a container labeled "Test
570 Ballots." The container must remain sealed for at least 2 months after the election, unless
581 needed for recount purposes. The tests provided for in this section must be open to the
592 public.
10 Sec. 60. Retroactivity. The Secretary of State may apply that section of this Act
11 that enacts the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 21-A, section 308 to valid requests received
12 by the Secretary of State after January 1, 2024.
13 SUMMARY
1144 This bill makes the following changes to the election laws.
15 1. It replaces uses of "polling place" in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 21-A with the
16 defined term "voting place."
17 2. It amends the definition of "closed period" to make it consistent with the statutory
18 provision allowing a voter to register to vote in an election through automatic voter
19 registration within a portion of the closed period.
20 3. It provides that the digital cast vote record is confidential, except that, in an election
21 determined by ranked-choice voting, the digital cast vote record becomes a public record
22 at the time the Secretary of State completes the tabulation of the vote.
23 4. It changes the deadline for submitting an online voter registration application from
24 midnight on the 21st day before election day to 5 p.m. on the 21st day before election day.
25 5. It makes nonsubstantive revisions to Title 21-A, sections 121 and 121-A, relating to
26 voter registration procedures, to improve clarity and readability. It also adjusts the
27 deadlines for the Secretary of State to transfer voter registration applications received from
28 outside agencies, imposing differing deadlines depending on how close to election day the
29 application is received.
30 6. It requires registrars to treat changes and withdrawals of enrollment as filed on the
31 15th day before the election if the 15th day before the election is a holiday and the change
32 or withdrawal of enrollment form is filed on the next business day after the holiday.
33 7. It designates new agencies as outside voter registration agencies, clarifies which
34 programs within those agencies must provide voter registration services and authorizes the
35 Secretary of State to provisionally designate additional agencies as voter registration
36 agencies, subject to the requirement that the Secretary of State submit draft legislation to
37 the Legislature adding the provisionally designated agency to the list of designated
38 agencies.
39 8. It amends the provision governing use of central voter registration data by clarifying
40 the permitted uses of voter data for purposes of evaluating, monitoring or seeking
41 compliance with certain laws, designating certain types of data as highly sensitive,
Page 21 - 132LR0564(01)

412 removing certain prohibitions on transfer or publication of central voter registration data
423 and specifying new civil violations for certain misuses of central voter registration data.
3 9. It enacts provisions governing treatment of qualifying and qualified political parties
4 that fail to attain or lose qualified status. The provisions allow for immediate disenrollment
5 of voters who enrolled in an unsuccessful qualifying party while allowing established
6 parties that are disqualified to retain their enrolled voters by filing a notice for up to one
7 full election cycle while they seek to enroll additional voters to reach the enrollment
8 threshold necessary for qualified status.
9 10. It creates a new process allowing a qualified party to voluntarily dissolve by filing
10 a notice with the Secretary of State. It gives this provision retroactive effect to January 1,
11 2024, allowing the Secretary of State to act on notices of dissolution received after that
12 date.
13 11. It permits parties to elect to allow unenrolled voters to sign their candidates' primary
14 nomination petitions by filing a notice with the Secretary of State.
15 12. It requires municipalities to make a municipal officer available to certify names on
16 candidate petitions on the day that primary petitions are due to the Secretary of State.
17 13. It clarifies that the Secretary of State may not accept a candidate consent form
18 unless it contains the required certification by the registrar of the candidate's enrollment.
19 14. It clarifies that the Secretary of State must accept party and nonparty candidate
20 petitions if they contain more than the maximum permitted number of valid signatures, but
21 that the Secretary of State may not validate those signatures above the maximum.
22 15. It provides for direct appeals to the Law Court from a decision by the Secretary of
23 State to validate or invalidate a party or nonparty candidate petition in response to a
24 challenge.
25 16. It enacts a new provision allowing for substitution of party-nominated presidential
26 electors if a nominated elector dies, withdraws or becomes disqualified before the election.
27 17. It creates an exception to the requirement of holding a primary election as part of
28 the process to fill a vacancy in the office of representative to Congress if the United States
29 Speaker of the House of Representatives invokes a federal law requiring expedited election
30 procedures if there are more than 100 vacancies in the United States House of
31 Representatives.
32 18. It requires a candidate wishing for the candidate's name to appear differently on the
33 ballot than it does on their candidate consent form to notify the Secretary of State no later
34 than 70 days prior to the election.
35 19. It allows the Secretary of State to prepare neutral instruction materials and posters
36 for posting at the voting place to the extent the Secretary of State determines them to be
37 necessary to assist voters.
38 20. It repeals requirements that the Secretary of State produce and disseminate a guide
39 to election law and conduct a training program for new municipal clerks.
40 21. It repeals the requirement that the Secretary of State implement a system for
41 collecting and logging concerns from members of the public regarding the conduct of
42 elections.
Page 22 - 132LR0564(01)

1 22. It requires a municipal clerk to post or have posted a notice of election, attested by
2 the clerk, in a conspicuous public place in a municipality at least 21 days immediately
3 before election day and at each voting place in the municipality on election day.
4 23. It changes the deadlines from 60 days before the election to 90 days before the
5 election for a municipality to request approval of a new voting place and for a party to file
6 a complaint concerning the size of an existing voting place.
7 24. It clarifies that the restrictions on certain advertising at the voting place and on
8 public property within 250 feet of the entrance of the voting place on election day include
9 apparel.
10 25. It clarifies that wardens may limit or disallow signature gathering at the voting
11 place as may be necessary to prevent violations of the ban on certain political activities at
12 the polls.
13 26. It prohibits any person other than an authorized municipal official to distribute or
14 collect voter registration applications inside the voting place or on public property within
15 250 feet of the entrance of the voting place on election day.
16 27. It consolidates into one new section several existing provisions regulating activities
17 at the voting place on election day, including pollwatching, signature gathering, charitable
18 activities and election observing.
19 28. It clarifies that a declared write-in candidate for President must file consent forms
20 for each of the presidential electors with the Secretary of State no later than 5 p.m. on the
21 70th day before the election.
22 29. It changes the deadline by which municipal clerks must make absentee ballot
23 applications available for primary elections from 3 months before the election to 2 months
24 before the election.
25 30. It amends the provision identifying the facilities subject to in-facility absentee
26 voting to include mental health residential facilities, residential facilities for individuals
27 with intellectual disabilities and state mental health institutes.
28 31. It allows municipalities that receive multiple requests for public inspection of
29 absentee ballots before processing, either on election day or in the 7 days before election
30 day, to reasonably limit the time and manner of public inspection and give priority to
31 authorized representatives of parties and candidates.
32 32. It clarifies that a vote for a write-in candidate for President is attributable to that
33 candidate's designated presidential electors.
34 33. It makes various changes to the provisions governing the electoral college to
35 conform to the federal Electoral Count Reform Act. It clarifies that the Governor must
36 issue the certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors no later than 6 days before
37 the meeting of electors. It also provides, in accordance with the Electoral Count Reform
38 Act, that the meeting of electors must happen on the Tuesday after the 2nd Wednesday in
39 December following their election. It specifies that the certificate of ascertainment of
40 appointment of electors must contain a security feature selected by the Secretary of State
41 in addition to the state seal.
42 34. It eliminates language governing the use of electronic tabulators providing for
43 secrecy envelopes for ballots.
Page 23 - 132LR0564(01)

1 35. It changes the format and updates certain language of the provision governing
2 closing of voting places that use electronic tabulators.
3 36. It provides that test ballots used to test electronic tabulating equipment must be
4 marked in red ink rather than blue or black ink.
