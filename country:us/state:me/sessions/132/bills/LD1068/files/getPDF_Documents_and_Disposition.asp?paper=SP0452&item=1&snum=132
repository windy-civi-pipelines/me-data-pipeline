22 successfully completed or passed the examination for, a certified public accountant,
23 certified information systems auditor or certified internal auditor at the time of election and
24 fails to become so qualified within 9 months of being sworn into office, as required by
25 section 242, that person may no longer serve as State Auditor and is ineligible for reelection
26 by the same Legislature and the office of State Auditor is deemed vacant.
