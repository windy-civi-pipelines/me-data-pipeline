11 Sec. 7. 35-A MRSA §3210-J, sub-§2, ¶F, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 321, §3, is
12 amended to read:
13 F. In conducting a solicitation and selecting eligible Class IA resources or combined
14 projects for contracts under this section, the commission shall:
15 (1) Consider the expected effect of eligible Class IA resources on other renewable
16 resources, as defined in section 3210, subsection 2, paragraph C, due to congestion
17 and curtailment;
18 (2) Select only those eligible Class IA resources or combined projects for contracts
19 that will benefit ratepayers; and
20 (3) Of those eligible Class IA resources or combined projects that benefit
21 ratepayers, give preference to eligible Class IA resources or combined projects as
22 follows:
23 (a) Primary preference to those eligible Class IA resources or combined
24 projects that are located on contaminated land; and
25 (b) Secondary preference to those eligible Class IA resources or combined
26 projects that minimize use of farmland that is not contaminated land and
27 minimize use of forested land.; and
28 (4) Use grid plans developed by large investor-owned transmission and
29 distribution utilities in accordance with the requirements set forth in section 3147,
30 subsection 6.
31 Sec. 8. 35-A MRSA §3804, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 328, §1, is amended to read:

23 132nd Legislature.
24 SUMMARY
2255 This bill requires the Public Utilities Commission and the Efficiency Maine Trust to
2266 use an energy forecasting method for energy supply and demand forecasting that is
2277 consistent with the energy forecasting method used by the Governor's Energy Office in
2288 preparing the comprehensive state energy plan. It requires the commission, in developing
2299 requests for proposals, conducting procurements and negotiating agreements for energy
3300 and energy storage systems, to consider the grid plans developed by large investor-owned
3311 transmission and distribution utilities to seek to optimize grid capacity and minimize the
3322 need for capital investment in the transmission or distribution system.
33 It also requires the commission to, when engaging in transmission and energy planning,
34 establish mechanisms to integrate grid plans filed by large investor-owned transmission
35 and distribution utilities, seek to improve efficiency and reliability of and reduce congestion
36 on the grid through the consideration of grid-enhancing technologies and advanced
37 conductors and incentivize the incorporation of low-voltage sensors to improve grid
38 monitoring capacity. The bill also requires the commission, in consultation with the
39 Efficiency Maine Trust and the Office of the Public Advocate, to conduct a review of the
40 nonwires alternative investigation and recommendation process established in the Maine
41 Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3132-C. By January 1, 2026, the commission must
42 provide a report of its recommendations to the Joint Standing Committee on Energy,
43 Utilities and Technology. The committee may report out a bill related to the commission's
44 recommendations to the Second Regular Session of the 132nd Legislature.
