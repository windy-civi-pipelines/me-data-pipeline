2. Time for requesting hearing; written request required. A person who receives
notification pursuant to this section is deemed to have waived the right to a hearing unless,
within 15 days of service of the notice, the person requests a hearing in writing.
3. Waiver of right to hearing; final administrative penalty by default. If a person
waives the right to a hearing, the commissioner shall by default issue a final administrative
penalty under section 2751-A against the person for the violations alleged and imposing
the penalty and any required corrective action, abatement or mitigation. A copy of the final
administrative penalty must be served upon the person by personal service or by certified
mail, return receipt requested.

penalty stays the collection of the penalty.
