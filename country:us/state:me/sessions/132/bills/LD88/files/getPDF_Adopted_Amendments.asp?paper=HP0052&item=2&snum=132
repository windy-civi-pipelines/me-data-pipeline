19 and Measures Law relating to the sale of firewood commits a civil violation for which a
20 fine must be adjudged in an amount not less than $50 nor more than $2,000, which is the
21 penalty under current law applicable to violations for which there is no specific penalty.
22 The amendment provides that administrative penalties do not apply to violations of the
23 Maine Weights and Measures Law relating to the sale of firewood under Title 10,
24 subchapter 7-A or the sale of commodities under Title 10, subchapter 2-A and that the civil
25 penalties for a violation of those provisions under current law are unchanged.
