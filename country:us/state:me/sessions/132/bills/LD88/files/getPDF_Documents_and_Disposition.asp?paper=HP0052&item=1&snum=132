18 subsection 4 and Title 7, section 16-D, which may include, but are not limited to, a

21 SUMMARY
2222 This bill authorizes the Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to
2233 assess administrative penalties for violations of the laws governing agriculture and animals
2244 and certain provisions of the Maine Weights and Measures Law. Under the bill, penalties
2255 may not exceed $5,000 for each occurrence and may not exceed $50,000 in total. The bill
2266 requires that a person be given notice of the penalties assessed and be given an opportunity
2277 to request a hearing before the penalty is imposed.
28 The bill establishes procedures for providing notice, holding hearings and remedies
29 that the commissioner may use when a person fails to pay a penalty imposed. These
30 remedies include allowing the commissioner to file a civil action to enforce penalties and,
31 in cases when the Maine Weights and Measures Law has been violated, allowing the
32 department to require a person to pay any unpaid penalties before renewing a license issued
33 by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and allowing enforcement by
34 the Superior Court in cases when the person does not have a license issued by the
35 department.
