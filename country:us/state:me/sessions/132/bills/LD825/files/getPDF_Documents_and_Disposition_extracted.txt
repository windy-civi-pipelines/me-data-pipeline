1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 38 MRSA §579-A is enacted to read:
3 §579-A. Geoengineering prohibited
4 1. Definitions. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the
5 following terms have the following meanings.
6 A. "Excessive electromagnetic, radio frequency or microwave radiation emissions"
7 means:
8 (1) With respect to electromagnetic emissions:
9 (a) A low-frequency alternating current electric field in excess of one volt per
10 meter;
11 (b) A magnetic field in excess of one milligauss;
12 (c) So-called dirty electricity caused by transients in electrical wiring that must
13 be filtered for safety;
14 (d) Ionizing radiation in excess of 0.02 millisievert per hour;
15 (e) A laser or other light with harmful effects; or
16 (f) Any vibration, noise, sound amplification by stimulated emissions
17 radiation, sonic weapon or other physical agent exceeding established
18 guidelines or standards; and
19 (2) With respect to radio frequency or microwave radiation emissions, emissions
20 of a signal strength in excess of -85 decibel-milliwatt for any frequency or channel
21 band specified by a transmitting entity's transmission license.
22 B. "Geoengineering" means any intentional, large-scale intervention in Earth's natural
23 systems, including, but not limited to, stratospheric aerosol injection; weather
24 modification techniques; excessive electromagnetic, radio frequency or microwave
25 radiation emissions; harmful nuclear, biological or chemical emissions; or other
26 polluting atmospheric activity.
27 C. "Harmful nuclear, biological or chemical emissions" means any nuclear, biological
28 or chemical emission that is xenobiotic and would otherwise not exist in the natural
29 environment or that is otherwise found at xenobiotic levels or levels beyond the limit
30 allowed under state or federal law.
31 D. "Solar radiation management" means any technique designed to reflect a portion of
32 the sun's radiation back into space.
33 E. "Stratospheric aerosol injection" means the release of reflective sulfate or other
34 aerosol particles into the stratosphere by high-altitude planes or blimps, tethered
35 balloons, artillery or other means for the purpose of solar radiation management.
36 F. "Weather modification technique" means any technique designed to alter or attempt
37 to alter Earth's natural weather patterns, including, but not limited to, cloud seeding.
38 2. Prohibition. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a person may
39 not engage in any activity that constitutes or involves geoengineering.
Page 1 - 132LR1237(01)
1 3. Enforcement; investigations; violations. The department shall enforce the
2 prohibition in this section. If the department discovers or is otherwise made aware of an
3 activity that may constitute or involve geoengineering, the department shall immediately
4 initiate appropriate investigative measures to determine whether a violation of this section
5 is occurring or has occurred and shall issue to any person engaging in the activity a notice
6 directing the person to cease all such activity that may be occurring in violation of this
7 section.
8 Notwithstanding section 349, Title 17-A, section 1704, subsection 3 or any other provision
9 of law to the contrary, a person that violates this section commits a Class C crime and is
10 subject to a fine of $500,000 for each day the violation continues and any other applicable
11 penalties under this Title or other provision of law or rule.
12 4. Activities involving Federal Government or other state or country. If the
13 department determines that an activity that constitutes or involves geoengineering
14 occurring or that had occurred within the State involves, directly or indirectly, the Federal
15 Government, another state or another country, the department shall issue to the Federal
16 Government or other state or country a notice that:
17 A. The activity is prohibited by law from occurring in or above the State; and
18 B. The Federal Government or other state or country is prohibited from engaging in
19 any future atmospheric activities in or above the State, regardless of whether such
20 activities involve or constitute geoengineering.
21 5. Reporting of violations. The department shall post on its publicly accessible
22 website information regarding the prohibition under this section and encouraging the public
23 to monitor, measure, document and report to the department incidents that may constitute
24 or involve geoengineering. Upon receipt of any such report, the department shall
25 immediately initiate appropriate investigative measures to determine whether a violation
26 of this section is occurring or has occurred.
27 SUMMARY
2288 This bill prohibits a person from engaging in any activity that constitutes or involves
2299 geoengineering. "Geoengineering" is defined in the bill as any intentional, large-scale
3300 intervention in Earth's natural systems and includes stratospheric aerosol injection; weather
3311 modification techniques; excessive electromagnetic, radio frequency or microwave
3322 radiation emissions; harmful nuclear, biological or chemical emissions; or other polluting
3333 atmospheric activity. The Department of Environmental Protection is charged with
3344 enforcing the prohibition, and a person that violates the prohibition commits a Class C
3355 crime and is subject to a fine of $500,000 for each day the violation continues and any other
3366 applicable penalties under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 38 or other provision of law
3377 or rule.
