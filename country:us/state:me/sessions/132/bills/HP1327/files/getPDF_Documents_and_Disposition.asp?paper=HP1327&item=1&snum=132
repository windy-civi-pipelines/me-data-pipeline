JOINT RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING MEMORIAL DAY
WHEREAS, Memorial Day, originally known as Decoration Day, began in the aftermath
of the Civil War and has grown into a solemn national observance honoring the men and
women of the United States Armed Forces who gave their lives in service to the nation; and
WHEREAS, thousands of Maine citizens have proudly served in the United States military
throughout the nation's history, many of whom made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our
freedoms and democratic ideals; and
WHEREAS, Memorial Day is observed each year on the last Monday in May and provides
a time for all Mainers and Americans to reflect, remember and honor the service members who
died in defense of our country; and
WHEREAS, it is fitting for the State to recognize the courage, dedication and selflessness
of these fallen heroes and to express gratitude to the families and communities who have borne
this profound loss; and
WHEREAS, the people of Maine continue to uphold the enduring tradition of Memorial
Day through local ceremonies, parades and flags placed on graves; now, therefore, be it
RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Thirty-second Legislature
now assembled in the First Special Session, on behalf of the people we represent, take this
opportunity to recognize Memorial Day as a day of solemn reflection and heartfelt gratitude
for those who gave their lives in defense of our country; and be it further
RESOLVED: That We encourage all citizens of the State to observe Memorial Day with
appropriate ceremonies and acts of remembrance in honor of our fallen service members and
their enduring legacy.
