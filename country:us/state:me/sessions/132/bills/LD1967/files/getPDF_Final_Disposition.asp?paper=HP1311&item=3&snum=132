Sec. 1. Maine home energy navigator and coaching pilot program.
Resolved: That the Governor's Energy Office and the Office of Policy Innovation and the
Future, referred to in this resolve as "the offices," in consultation with the Efficiency Maine
Trust, the Maine State Housing Authority and the Maine Office of Community Affairs,
shall design a Maine home energy navigator and coaching pilot program, referred to in this
resolve as "the pilot program." The pilot program must be designed to:

Section 2:
1. Provide community-based energy coaching services to residential consumers;

Section 3:
2. Provide guidance to residential consumers, particularly those in low-income and
underserved communities, to understand and navigate energy efficiency and clean energy
investment options to affordably meet their home energy needs;

Section 4:
3. Advise residential consumers on accessing available grants, rebates, financing and
other assistance programs and incentives to meet their home energy needs;

Section 5:
4. Assist residential consumers in prioritizing identified energy-saving opportunities,
including through the integration of weatherization strategies to reduce heating and cooling
loads that could minimize the need for the installation of new equipment and lower future
electric demands on the grid;

Section 6:
5. Help residential consumers review and analyze contractor recommendations
regarding cost, payment and other relevant factors;

Section 7:
6. Minimize potential liability risks for the pilot program; and

Section 8:
7. Use grant funds and private partnerships to support pilot program implementation.
For the purposes of this resolve, "residential consumers" includes homeowners and
renters.
The offices shall consult with community-based organizations and tribal governments
regarding pilot program design and implementation considerations.
Sec. 2. Report. Resolved: That the offices shall submit a report on the pilot program
design to the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology by February
Page 1 - 132LR2211(03)
1, 2026. The report must include a description of the design of the pilot program, a
description of the technical assistance and educational materials to be developed as part of
the pilot program, an estimate of pilot program costs, a target number of residential
consumers to be served by the pilot program and a proposed timeline for implementation
of the pilot program. The committee may report out a bill based on the report to the Second
Regular Session of the 132nd Legislature.
