19 Services provided by a veterans' facility must be reimbursed by the MaineCare program

1 3. Rate calculations. Different rates must be established for nursing home services
2 and residential care facility services provided by a veterans' facility.
3 A. For nursing homes, rate calculations under this section must follow the process and
4 principles established in section 3173-J to determine a daily rate that is reasonable and
5 adequate to cover the MaineCare allowable costs of operating a nursing home operated
6 by the Maine Veterans' Homes to reflect any meaningful cost differences between
7 veterans' and nonveterans' nursing home costs for the direct care and routine care cost
8 components of the daily rate. Adjustments to rates and reimbursement for purposes
9 that include, but are not limited to, audit procedures, quality and case mix must be made
10 in the same manner as those adjustments are made for all other nursing homes as
11 established in department rule.
12 B. For residential care facilities, rate calculations under this section must include an
13 add-on per diem rate that is reasonable and adequate to cover the demonstrated
14 MaineCare allowable costs of operating veterans' facilities that are residential care
15 facilities when provided in addition to the per diem rates already established under
16 MaineCare rules for reimbursement of residential care facilities. The add-on amounts
17 are subject to cost settlement so that total reimbursement does not exceed MaineCare
18 allowable costs for each facility.
19 4. Annual adjustments for inflation. The per diem rates must be annually adjusted
20 for inflation to the same extent that MaineCare reimbursement rates for other nursing
21 homes and residential care facilities that are not operated by the Maine Veterans' Homes
22 are adjusted.
23 Sec. 2. Supplemental payments previously appropriated. Upon
24 implementation of the rate calculations process established in the Maine Revised Statutes,
25 Title 22, section 1708-A, any supplemental funding allocated or appropriated for the Maine
26 Veterans' Homes in Public Law 2023, chapter 412 that has not been expended may not be
27 used as supplemental payments but may be used for the purposes of this Act.
