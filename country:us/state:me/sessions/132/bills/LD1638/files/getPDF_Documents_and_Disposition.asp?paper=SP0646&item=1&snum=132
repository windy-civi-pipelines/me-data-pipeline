17 A. The amount of any disability retirement benefit payable under this article must be

20 (1) The workers' compensation or similar laws, except amounts that may be paid

26 Sec. 5. Retroactivity; payment of benefits and interest. This Act applies
27 retroactively to a person who was receiving disability retirement benefits under the Maine
28 Public Employees Retirement System as of December 31, 2024 if those disability
29 retirement benefits were reduced because the person received disability retirement benefits
30 under the United States Social Security Act. A person affected by this Act must be paid
31 the difference between:
32 1. The amount of disability retirement benefits, including any cost-of-living
33 adjustments, the person should have received absent any reduction to such benefits due to
34 the receipt of disability retirement benefits under the United States Social Security Act; and
35 2. The amount of disability retirement benefits the person actually received.
36 The person must be paid the difference with interest accruing from the date the person's
37 disability retirement benefits were reduced to the date of the payment made pursuant to this
38 section. The rate of interest must be calculated pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes,
39 Title 36, section 186.

1 SUMMARY
22 Under current law, the disability retirement benefits paid by the Maine Public
33 Employees Retirement System to a person who is disabled are reduced if that person
44 receives benefits from the United States Social Security Act. This bill removes that
55 reduction for persons who are disabled and were receiving disability retirement benefits
66 from the Maine Public Employees Retirement System as of December 31, 2024. The
77 provisions of the bill retroactively apply to the date that person began receiving reduced
88 disability retirement benefits and requires that the person be paid the withheld benefits,
99 including any cost-of-living adjustments and interest. The bill also removes the
1100 requirement that such a person include in the application for disability retirement benefits
1111 proof that the person has made application for benefits under the United States Social
1122 Security Act.
