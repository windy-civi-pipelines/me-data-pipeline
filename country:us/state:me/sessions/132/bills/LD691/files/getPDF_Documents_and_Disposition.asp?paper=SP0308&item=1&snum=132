6 direction of the Governor, to issue bonds in the name and on behalf of the State in an
7 amount not exceeding $25,000,000 for the purposes described in section 5 of this Act. The
8 bonds are a pledge of the full faith and credit of the State. The bonds may not run for a
9 period longer than 10 years from the date of the original issue of the bonds.

17 bonds, which must be held by the Treasurer of State and paid by the Treasurer of State
18 upon warrants drawn by the State Controller, are appropriated solely for the purposes set
19 forth in this Act. Any unencumbered balances remaining at the completion of the project
20 in this Act lapse to the Office of the Treasurer of State to be used for the retirement of
21 general obligation bonds.
22 Sec. 4. Interest and debt retirement. The Treasurer of State shall pay interest
23 due or accruing on any bonds issued under this Act and all sums coming due for payment
24 of bonds at maturity.
