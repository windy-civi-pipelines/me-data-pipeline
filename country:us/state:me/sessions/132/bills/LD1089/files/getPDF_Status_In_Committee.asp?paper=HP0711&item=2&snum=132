1 SUMMARY
22 This amendment replaces the bill and changes the title. The amendment imposes an
33 income tax surcharge of 2% on that portion of a taxpayer's Maine taxable income in excess
44 of $1,000,000 for single filers and married persons filing separate returns, $1,500,000 for
55 heads of households and $2,000,000 for married persons filing jointly or surviving spouses
66 to fund public prekindergarten to grade 12 education and exempts the revenue from the
77 surcharge from the calculation of state-municipal revenue sharing. The amendment

99 Treasurer of State, beginning January 1, 2026, to deposit monthly into the fund 8.333% of
1100 the estimated annual total revenue from the surcharge. Revenue transferred into the fund
1111 must be used to ensure the State meets or exceeds the target for education funding, which
1122 is currently 55%. The amendment also adds an appropriations and allocations section.
