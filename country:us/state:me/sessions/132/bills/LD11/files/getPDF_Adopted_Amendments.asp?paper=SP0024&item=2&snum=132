9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to S.P. 24, L.D. 11, “An Act Regarding
10 Temperature Standards for School Buildings”
11 Amend the bill by incorporating the attached fiscal note.
12 SUMMARY
1133 This amendment incorporates a fiscal note. The preliminary fiscal impact statement
1144 provided that, because the bill requires school boards to adopt and implement a policy
1155 establishing maximum and minimum temperature standards for school buildings and post
1166 that policy on their publicly accessible websites, expenditure of local revenue may be
1177 required and, as a result, the preliminary fiscal impact statement identified the bill
1188 requirements as a potential state mandate. The committee reviewed the preliminary fiscal
1199 impact statement and determined that the requirements of the bill do not amount to a
2200 mandate. The Maine Revised Statutes, Title 20-A, section 1001, subsection 1-A provides
2211 that a duty of a school board is the adoption of policies that govern the school administrative
2222 unit under the school board’s jurisdiction. This duty may result in minor administrative
2233 costs that may be incurred to draft and post the policy. A school board may choose to adopt
2244 a temperature policy that incurs additional costs to the school administrative unit; however,
2255 the adoption of such a policy is ultimately voluntary and not required under this bill as the
2266 bill does not provide any specific parameters for the temperature policy. A school board
2277 may choose to adopt a policy that does not incur any expenditures. As such, the committee
2288 believes that this bill does not constitute a mandate.
