1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 35-A MRSA §301, sub-§7 is enacted to read:
3 7. Administrative charge limitations and transparency. The following provisions
4 govern administrative charges.
5 A. For purposes of this subsection, "administrative charge" means a fee or charge for
6 services that is added to the actual cost of materials or supplies provided or labor
7 performed by or on behalf of a public utility with over 50,000 customers and charged
8 to a public utility customer through a proposal, estimate, invoice or final accounting
9 for the cost of interconnection, line extensions or work other than monthly electrical
10 service. "Administrative charge" includes, but is not limited to, administrative service
11 charges, indirect overhead costs and cost adders. "Administrative charge" does not
12 include:
13 (1) Expenses for a public utility employee's labor while directly engaged in the
14 work for which a customer is billed; or
15 (2) Expenses related to the purchase, storage or delivery of materials or supplies
16 incorporated into the work if the customer bill states that those expenses are
17 included in the cost of materials and supplies.
18 B. The commission shall conduct one or more proceedings beginning in 2025 and every
19 5 years thereafter to review and investigate administrative charges demanded or
20 collected by a public utility with over 50,000 customers under paragraph A to ensure
21 that such administrative charges comply with the provisions of this section. The initial
22 investigation by the commission must review administrative charges demanded or
23 collected in the prior 5 years. If the commission finds that a public utility has
24 overcollected administrative charges from one or more customers or ratepayers, the
25 commission may:
26 (1) Order the utility to refund to the customer any excess administrative charges
27 paid by the customer; or
28 (2) If paid by ratepayers, order the utility to refund excess administrative charges
29 in future rates.
30 C. By September 1, 2026, the commission shall adopt rules requiring that a public
31 utility described in paragraph B disclose all administrative charges on any proposal,
32 estimate or invoice for work charged to a customer or to ratepayers. If any line item in
33 a proposal, estimate or invoice includes an administrative charge, the proposal,
34 estimate or invoice must disclose the amount of the administrative charge for that line
35 item and the activities the administrative charge covers. Rules adopted pursuant to this
36 paragraph are routine technical rules as described in Title 5, chapter 375, subsection
37 2-A.
38 D. The commission shall submit a report to the joint standing committee of the
39 Legislature having jurisdiction over utilities matters and the Governor's Energy Office
40 following an investigation under paragraph B by July 1st of the following year.
41 Sec. 2. 35-A MRSA §1714, sub-§2, ¶C, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 623, §2, is

8 reallocated by RR 2019, c. 1, Pt. A, §49, is amended to read:
9 2. Consumer assistance. Require a customer bill issued by an investor-owned
10 transmission and distribution utility to display clearly and prominently the toll-free
11 telephone number for the commission's consumer assistance and safety division and a
12 statement of the consumer assistance services available by calling the division; and
13 Sec. 5. 35-A MRSA §3107, sub-§3, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 88, §1 and
14 reallocated by RR 2019, c. 1, Pt. A, §49, is amended to read:
15 3. Correction of misleading information. Establish a process by which, if the
16 commission finds that an investor-owned transmission and distribution utility has included
17 on customer bills, or inserts or attachments to customer bills, information that is
18 misleading, deceptive or inaccurate, the transmission and distribution utility is required to
19 provide to customers a statement that corrects the misleading, deceptive or inaccurate
20 information that was disseminated. Upon request of the Public Advocate, the commission
21 shall investigate the truth and accuracy of information included on customer bills, or inserts
22 or attachments to customer bills.; and
23 Sec. 6. 35-A MRSA §3107, sub-§4 is enacted to read:

28 programs and low-income energy assistance programs.
29 Sec. 7. 35-A MRSA §3209-A, sub-§1, ¶B-1 is enacted to read:
30 B-1. "Net crediting" means a manner of consolidated billing for distributed generation
31 resources in which the transmission and distribution utility applies the net value of the
32 bill credit on the participating customer's bills and provides payment for the
33 subscription fee directly to the project sponsor no later than 30 days after the final day
34 of the billing period in which the energy was generated, regardless of the payment
35 made by the customer. The net value of the bill credit must be calculated as the
36 participating customer's total kilowatt-hour credit for the billing period multiplied by
37 the customer's savings rate, as provided by the project sponsor.
38 Sec. 8. 35-A MRSA §3209-A, sub-§10 is enacted to read:
39 10. Consolidated billing. By June 1, 2026, the commission shall provide by rule that

Page 2 - 132LR1838(01)
413 transmission and distribution utility may require a fee for a project sponsor or distributed
424 generation resource that uses net crediting. Such a fee may not exceed 1% of the
435 subscription fee. In implementing net crediting, the commission shall require a project
446 sponsor to provide the applicable transmission and distribution utility with each customer's
457 savings rate. The project sponsor shall set a residential customer's savings rate higher than
468 zero. A distributed generation resource may include different savings rates for customers
479 participating under the same distributed generation resource. Each transmission and
580 distribution utility shall use the same net crediting format for customers on payment plans
591 or participating in budget billing programs. A transmission and distribution utility shall
1502 implement net crediting so it may be used by distributed generation resources by January
1513 1, 2027.
12 Sec. 9. 35-A MRSA §3209-A, sub-§11 is enacted to read:
13 11. Data access. For a customer participating in net energy billing, a transmission and
14 distribution utility shall provide the relevant project sponsor with the customer's usage and
15 billing information, including net energy billing data needed to administer a customer's net
16 energy billing arrangement, as long as the project sponsor has received the customer's
17 authorization.
18 Sec. 10. 35-A MRSA §3209-B, sub-§1, ¶C-1 is enacted to read:
19 C-1. "Net crediting" has the same meaning as in section 3209-A, subsection 1,
20 paragraph B-1.
21 Sec. 11. 35-A MRSA §3209-B, sub-§9 is enacted to read:
22 9. Consolidated billing. By June 1, 2026, the commission shall provide by rule that
23 a transmission and distribution utility must offer consolidated billing to a distributed
24 generation resource at the distributed generation resource's request. The consolidated
25 billing method must use net crediting. The commission shall consider whether a
26 transmission and distribution utility may require a fee for a project sponsor or distributed
27 generation resource that uses net crediting. Such a fee may not exceed 1% of the
28 subscription fee. In implementing net crediting, the commission shall require a project
29 sponsor to provide the applicable transmission and distribution utility with each customer's
30 savings rate. The project sponsor shall set a customer's savings rate higher than zero. A
31 distributed generation resource may include different savings rates for customers
32 participating under the same distributed generation resource. Each transmission and
33 distribution utility shall use the same net crediting format for customers on payment plans
34 or participating in budget billing programs. A transmission and distribution utility shall
35 implement net crediting so it may be used by distributed generation resources by January
36 1, 2027.
37 Sec. 12. Public Utilities Commission to conduct proceeding. The Public
38 Utilities Commission shall conduct, by December 31, 2025, a proceeding pursuant to the
39 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3209-E, subsection 2, paragraph A to examine
40 and evaluate opt-in program designs to reduce net energy billing costs. The commission

22 This bill directs the Public Utilities Commission to conduct one or more proceedings
33 beginning in 2025 and every 5 years thereafter to review and investigate administrative
