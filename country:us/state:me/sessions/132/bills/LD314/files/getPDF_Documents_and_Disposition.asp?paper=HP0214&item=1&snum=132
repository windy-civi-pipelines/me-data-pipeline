24 SUMMARY
2255 This bill establishes the Maine Small Dollar Consumer Protection Act. It establishes
2266 the required process for supervised lenders to offer small dollar loans, which are defined
2277 as loans not exceeding $2,500 that are unsecured and paid in substantially equal
2288 installments and that mature not less than 90 days or more than 365 days after the date of
2299 the agreement, and the rights that consumers have when entering into small dollar loan
3300 agreements.
31 It also repeals the provision that provides that a person is a lender subject to the
32 requirements of the Maine Consumer Credit Code governing finance charges and related
33 provisions notwithstanding the fact that the person purports to act as an agent or service
34 provider or in another capacity for another entity that is exempt from the requirements of
35 the Maine Consumer Credit Code governing finance charges and related provisions if
36 certain conditions are met.
37 It provides that the requirements of the Maine Consumer Credit Code governing
38 finance charges and related provisions do not apply to a person doing business pursuant to
39 any law of this State or of the United States relating to banks, national banking associations,
40 savings banks, trust companies, savings and loan associations, credit unions or mortgage
41 companies, including without limitation any affiliate, subsidiary or service provider of such
42 a person, irrespective of whether or not such an affiliate, subsidiary or service provider is
43 a bank.
