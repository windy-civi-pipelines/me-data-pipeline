12 E. Notwithstanding paragraph D and except as provided in section 9607, a controller
13 is not required to authenticate an opt-out request.
14 F. A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other
15 than the consumer is in compliance with a request to delete that data pursuant to
16 subsection 1, paragraph D by retaining a record of the deletion request and the
17 minimum data necessary for the purpose of ensuring that the consumer's personal data:
18 (1) Remains deleted from the controller's records; and
19 (2) Is not used for any other purpose.
20 6. Appeals. A controller shall establish a process in accordance with the requirements
21 of this subsection for a consumer or other person authorized to exercise the consumer's
22 rights to appeal the controller's inaction on a request within a reasonable period of time
23 after the consumer's receipt of the decision.
24 A. The appeal process must be conspicuously available and similar to the process for
25 submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to this section.
26 B. Not later than the 60th day after receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the
27 consumer or other person authorized to exercise the consumer's rights in writing of
28 action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of
29 the reasons for the decisions.
30 C. If a controller denies an appeal, the controller shall provide the consumer with an
31 online mechanism, if available, through which the consumer or other person authorized
32 to exercise the consumer's rights may contact the Attorney General to submit a
33 complaint.
34 §9607. Authorized agent
35 1. Authority to designate agent to opt out of processing. A consumer may designate
36 another person to serve as the consumer's authorized agent, and act on the consumer's
37 behalf, to exercise the consumer's right under section 9606, subsection 1, paragraph G to
38 opt out of the processing of personal data.
39 2. Method of designating agent. The consumer may designate an authorized agent
40 by way of, among other methods, a technology, including, but not limited to, an Internet
41 link or a browser setting, browser extension or global device setting, indicating the
42 consumer's intent to opt out of certain processing of the consumer's data.
Page 11 - 132LR0014(01)
1 3. Authentication of agent's opt-out request. A controller shall comply with a
2 request received from an authorized agent to exercise the consumer's right under section
3 9606, subsection 1, paragraph G to opt out of the processing of personal data if, using
4 commercially reasonable efforts, the controller is able to authenticate:
5 A. The identity of the consumer; and
6 B. The authorized agent's authority to act on the consumer's behalf.
7 §9608. Actions of controllers
8 1. Prohibitions. A controller may not:
9 A. Collect, process or share sensitive data concerning a consumer, unless the collection
10 or processing is strictly necessary to provide or maintain a specific product or service
11 requested by the consumer;
12 B. Sell sensitive data;
13 C. Process personal data in violation of state or federal laws that prohibit unlawful
14 discrimination;
15 D. If the controller knows or reasonably should know that the consumer is a minor:
16 (1) Process personal data of the consumer for the purpose of targeted advertising;
17 or
18 (2) Sell the personal data of the consumer;
19 E. Retaliate against a consumer for exercising a consumer right granted in this chapter,
20 including by denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or
21 services or providing a different level of quality of goods or services to the consumer;
22 F. Collect, process or disclose personal data or publicly available information in a
23 manner that unlawfully discriminates in or otherwise unlawfully makes unavailable the
24 equal enjoyment of goods or services on the basis of an individual's actual or perceived
25 race, color, sex, sexual orientation or gender identity, physical or mental disability,
26 religion, ancestry, national origin, age or familial status. This paragraph does not apply
27 to the collection, processing or disclosure of personal data for:
28 (1) The purpose of self-testing to prevent or mitigate unlawful discrimination;
29 (2) The purpose of diversifying an applicant, participant or customer pool; or
30 (3) A private establishment described in 42 United States Code, Section 2000a(e);
31 or
32 G. Unless the controller obtains the consumer's consent, process personal data for a
33 purpose that is neither reasonably necessary to nor compatible with the disclosed
34 purposes for which the personal data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer.
35 2. Duties. A controller shall:
36 A. Limit the collection of personal data to what is reasonably necessary and
37 proportionate to provide or maintain a specific product or service requested by the
38 consumer to whom the data pertains;
39 B. Establish, implement and maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical
40 data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of
Page 12 - 132LR0014(01)
411 personal data appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data at issue. These
422 processes must include the disposal of personal data in accordance with a retention
433 schedule that requires the disposal of personal data by the controller when the data is
444 required to be deleted by law or when the data is no longer necessary for the purpose
455 for which the data was processed unless the consumer has consented to the retention
466 of the data for a longer period of time or retention of the data is required by law. For
477 purposes of this paragraph, "disposal of personal data" means the destruction or
488 permanent deletion of the data or other modification of the data to make the data
499 unreadable and unrecoverable; and
10 C. Provide an effective mechanism for a consumer to revoke the consumer's consent to
11 processing personal data under this section that is at least as easy to use as the
12 mechanism by which the consumer provided the consumer's consent and, upon
13 revocation of the consent, shall cease to process the data as soon as practicable, but not
14 later than 30 days after the receipt of the request.
15 3. Exceptions; loyalty programs. Subsection 1 and 2 may not be construed to:
16 A. Require a controller to provide a product or service that requires the processing of
17 personal data of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain; or
18 B. Prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality or selection
19 of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if
20 the offering is in connection with a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide
21 loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts or club card program, as long as the sale
22 of personal data is not a condition of participation in the program.
23 4. Privacy notice. A controller shall provide consumers with a reasonably accessible,
24 clear and meaningful privacy notice that includes the following information:
25 A. The categories of personal data, including sensitive data, processed by the
26 controller;
27 B. The controller's purpose for processing personal data;
28 C. How consumers may exercise their consumer rights under this chapter, including
29 how a consumer may appeal a controller's decision regarding the consumer's request
30 and how a consumer may revoke consent;
31 D. The categories of 3rd parties with which the controller shares personal data, with a
32 level of detail that enables a consumer to understand the type of, business model of or
33 processing conducted by each category of 3rd party;
34 E. The categories of personal data, including sensitive data, the controller shares with
35 any 3rd party;
36 F. The length of time the controller intends to retain each category of personal data or,
37 if it is not possible to identify the length of time, the criteria used to determine the
38 length of time the controller intends to retain each category of personal data; and
39 G. An active e-mail address or other online mechanism that a consumer may use to
40 contact the controller.
41 5. Notice of sale of personal data, targeted advertising or profiling; opt-out
42 mechanism. If a controller sells personal data to 3rd parties, processes personal data for
Page 13 - 132LR0014(01)
413 the purposes of targeted advertising or processes personal data for the purposes of profiling
424 the consumer in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects
435 concerning the consumer, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose the sale
446 or processing, as well as the manner in which a consumer may exercise the right to opt out
457 of the sale or processing. The disclosure required under this subsection must be
468 prominently displayed on the controller's publicly accessible website and the language used
479 must be clear, easy to understand and unambiguous.
8 6. Method for exercising consumer rights. A controller shall establish, and shall
9 describe in the privacy notice as required by subsection 4, paragraph C, one or more secure
10 and reliable mechanisms for a consumer to submit a request to exercise each consumer
11 right under this chapter.
12 A. The design of the secure and reliable mechanism for a consumer to submit a request
13 must take into account:
14 (1) The ways in which consumers normally interact with the controller;
15 (2) The need for secure and reliable communication of consumer requests; and
16 (3) The ability of the controller to verify the identity of a consumer making the
17 request.
18 B. A controller may not require a consumer to create a new account to exercise a
19 consumer right. A controller may require a consumer to use an existing account to
20 exercise a consumer right.
21 C. A controller may satisfy the controller's obligation under this subsection to establish
22 a secure and reliable mechanism for a consumer to exercise the right to opt out under
23 subsection 5 by:
24 (1) Providing a clear and conspicuous link on the controller's publicly accessible
25 website to a webpage that allows a consumer, an authorized agent of the consumer
26 or a person authorized by section 9606, subsection 4 to exercise the consumer's
27 rights, to opt out of any processing of the consumer's personal data for the purposes
28 of targeted advertising or profiling or any sale of personal data; or
29 (2) No later than July 1, 2026, allowing a consumer to opt out of any processing of
30 the consumer's personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising or profiling
31 or any sale of personal data through an opt-out preference signal sent, with the
32 consumer's consent, by a platform, technology or mechanism to the controller
33 indicating the consumer's intent to opt out of the processing or sale. The platform,
34 technology or mechanism:
35 (a) Must be consumer-friendly and easy to use by the average consumer;
36 (b) Must use clear, easy to understand and unambiguous language;
37 (c) Must be as consistent as possible with any other similar platform,
38 technology or mechanism required by federal or state law, rule or regulation;
39 (d) Must enable the controller to reasonably determine whether the consumer
40 is a resident of the State, which reasonable determination may be based on the
41 location associated with the consumer's Internet protocol address, and whether
Page 14 - 132LR0014(01)
412 the consumer has made a legitimate request to opt out of any such processing
423 or sale of the consumer's personal data;
3 (e) May not unfairly disadvantage another controller; and
4 (f) May not make use of a default setting but must require the consumer to
5 make an affirmative, freely given and unambiguous choice to opt out of any
6 such processing or sale of the consumer's personal data.
7 A controller that recognizes an opt-out preference signal that has been approved by the
8 laws of another state is considered to be in compliance with this paragraph.
9 D. If a consumer's decision to opt out of any processing of the consumer's personal data
10 for the purposes of targeted advertising or profiling or any sale of personal data through
11 an opt-out preference signal sent in accordance with paragraph C, subparagraph (2)
12 conflicts with the consumer's existing controller-specific privacy setting or the
13 consumer's voluntary participation in a controller's bona fide loyalty, rewards,
14 premium features, discounts or club card program, the controller may notify the
15 consumer of the conflict and provide the consumer a choice to confirm the controller-
16 specific privacy setting or participation that program.
17 §9609. Responsibilities of processors and controllers
18 1. Contract required. If a controller uses a processor to process personal data of a
19 consumer, the controller and the processor shall enter into a contract in accordance with
20 the requirements of this section that governs the processor's data processing procedures
21 with respect to processing performed on behalf of the controller.
22 A. The contract must be binding and must clearly set forth:
23 (1) Instructions for processing personal data;
24 (2) The nature and purpose of the processing;
25 (3) The type of personal data subject to processing;
26 (4) The duration of the processing; and
27 (5) The rights and obligations of the processor and the controller.
28 B. The contract must require that the processor:
29 (1) Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of
30 confidentiality with respect to the data;
31 (2) Establish, implement and maintain reasonable administrative, technical and
32 physical data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity and
33 accessibility of personal data, considering the volume and nature of the personal
34 data;
35 (3) Stop processing personal data on request by the controller made in accordance
36 with a consumer's authenticated request;
37 (4) At the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller
38 as requested at the end of the provision of service, unless retention of the personal
39 data is required by law;
Page 15 - 132LR0014(01)
1 (5) On the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all
2 information in the processor's possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's
3 compliance with the obligations in this chapter;
4 (6) After providing the controller an opportunity to object, engage a subcontractor
5 to assist with processing personal data on the controller's behalf only in accordance
6 with a written contract that requires the subcontractor to meet the processor's
7 obligations regarding the personal data under the processor's contract with the
8 controller;
9 (7) Allow and cooperate with reasonable assessments by the controller, the
10 controller's designated assessor or a qualified and independent assessor arranged
11 for by the processor to assess the processor's policies and technical and
12 organizational measures in support of the obligations under this chapter. An
13 assessment conducted under this subparagraph must be conducted using an
14 appropriate and accepted control standard framework and assessment procedure;
15 and
16 (8) On request of the controller, provide the controller with a report of an
17 assessment conducted under subparagraph (7).
18 2. Processor responsibilities. A processor shall:
19 A. Adhere to a contract with a controller and the instructions of the controller;
20 B. Assist the controller in meeting the controller's obligations under this chapter,
21 including:
22 (1) By employing appropriate technical and organizational measures as much as
23 reasonably practicable to fulfill the controller's obligation to respond to requests to
24 exercise consumer rights, considering the nature of processing and the information
25 available to the processor; and
26 (2) By assisting the controller in meeting the controller's obligations in relation to
27 the security of processing the personal data under this chapter and in relation to the
28 notification of a breach of the security of a system, as required by chapter 210-B;
29 and
30 C. Provide necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document
31 data protection assessments as required by section 9611.
32 3. Processing relationship liability. This section may not be construed to relieve a
33 controller or a processor from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by virtue
34 of the controller's or processor's role in the processing relationship in accordance with this
35 section.
36 4. Fact-based determination of role. The determination of whether a person is acting
37 as a controller or a processor with respect to a specific processing of personal data is a fact-
38 based determination that depends on the context in which the personal data is being
39 processed as described in this subsection.
40 A. A person is considered to be a controller if:
41 (1) The person is not limited in the person's processing of specific personal data in
42 accordance with a controller's instructions; or
Page 16 - 132LR0014(01)
1 (2) The person fails to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific
2 processing of personal data.
3 B. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a
4 specific processing of personal data remains a processor.
5 C. If a processor or 3rd party begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the
6 purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor is a controller
7 with respect to the processing and may be subject to an enforcement action under
8 section 9614.
9 5. Controller's duties unaffected. This section may not be construed to alter a
10 controller's obligation to limit a person's processing of personal data or to take steps to
11 ensure that a processor adheres to the controller's instructions.
12 §9610. Third-party responsibilities
13 1. Notice required. If a 3rd party intends to use or share a consumer's personal data
14 in a manner inconsistent with the disclosures made to the consumer at the time that the
15 personal data was collected, the 3rd party shall provide an affected consumer with notice
16 of the new or changed use or sharing of personal data before implementing the new or
17 changed use or sharing.
18 2. Method of notification. The 3rd party shall provide the notice required by
19 subsection 1 in a manner and at a time reasonably calculated to allow a consumer to
20 exercise the consumer's rights under this chapter.
21 §9611. Data protection assessments
22 1. Definition. For the purposes of this section, "processing activities that present a
23 heightened risk of harm to a consumer" means:
24 A. The processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising;
25 B. The sale of personal data;
26 C. The processing of sensitive data; and
27 D. The processing of personal data for the purposes of profiling, in which the profiling
28 presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:
29 (1) Unfair, abusive or deceptive treatment of a consumer;
30 (2) Having an unlawful disparate impact on a consumer;
31 (3) Financial, physical or reputational injury to a consumer;
32 (4) A physical or other intrusion on the solitude or seclusion, or the private affairs
33 or concerns, of a consumer, when the intrusion would be offensive to a reasonable
34 person; or
35 (5) Other substantial injury to a consumer.
36 2. Data protection assessments required. A controller shall conduct and document a
37 data protection assessment for each of the controller's processing activities that present a
38 heightened risk of harm to a consumer, including an assessment for each algorithm that is
39 used. A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing
40 operations that include similar activities.
Page 17 - 132LR0014(01)
1 3. Required elements. A data protection assessment required by subsection 2 must be
2 conducted in accordance with the requirements of this subsection.
3 A. The data protection assessment must identify and weigh the benefits that may flow
4 directly and indirectly from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other
5 interested parties and the public against:
6 (1) The potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with the processing
7 as mitigated by safeguards that may be employed by the controller to reduce these
8 risks; and
9 (2) The necessity and proportionality of processing in relation to the stated purpose
10 of the processing.
11 B. The controller shall factor into a data protection assessment:
12 (1) The use of de-identified data;
13 (2) The reasonable expectations of consumers;
14 (3) The context of the processing; and
15 (4) The relationship between the controller and the consumer whose personal data
16 will be processed.
17 4. Disclosure to Attorney General. The Attorney General may require that a
18 controller disclose to the Attorney General a data protection assessment that is relevant to
19 an investigation conducted by the Attorney General. The Attorney General may evaluate
20 the data protection assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in this
21 chapter.
22 5. Confidentiality. A data protection assessment is confidential and exempt from
23 disclosure under Title 1, chapter 13 but may be used by the Attorney General in an action
24 to enforce this chapter. To the extent that any information contained in a data protection
25 assessment disclosed to the Attorney General pursuant to this section includes information
26 subject to attorney-client privilege or work product protection, the disclosure does not
27 constitute a waiver of that privilege or protection.
28 6. Reciprocity. If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose
29 of complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection assessment
30 satisfies the requirements established in this section if the data protection assessment is
31 reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data protection assessment that would
32 otherwise be conducted in accordance with this section.
33 7. Deadlines for performing data protection assessments. A controller shall conduct
34 and document a data protection assessment as required by this section:
35 A. Within 6 months of the date that the controller first engages in a processing activity
36 that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer; and
37 B. Within 6 months of making a material change to any processing activity that presents
38 a heightened risk of harm to a consumer.
39 8. Application. The requirement to conduct a data protection assessment under this
40 section applies only to processing activities that occur on or after July 1, 2026.
41 §9612. De-identified data
Page 18 - 132LR0014(01)
1 1. Re-identification not required. This chapter may not be construed to require a
2 controller or processor to:
3 A. Re-identify de-identified data;
4 B. Maintain data in an identifiable form; or
5 C. Collect, obtain, retain or access any data or technology in order to be capable of
6 associating an authenticated consumer request with personal data.
7 2. Consumer requests. This chapter may not be construed to require a controller or
8 processor to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request if the controller:
9 A. Is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal data, or it
10 would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request with the
11 personal data;
12 B. Does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the consumer who is the
13 subject of the personal data, or associate the personal data with other personal data
14 about the same consumer; and
15 C. Does not sell the personal data to a 3rd party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the
16 personal data to a 3rd party other than a processor, except as otherwise allowed in this
17 chapter.
18 3. Contractual oversight. A controller that discloses de-identified data shall exercise
19 reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with contractual commitments to which the
20 de-identified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to address breaches of those
21 contractual commitments. Whether oversight is reasonable and whether steps taken to
22 address breaches of contractual commitments are appropriate depends in part on whether
23 the disclosed de-identified data would be considered sensitive data if the data were re-
24 identified.
25 §9613. Exemptions
26 1. Exempt activities. This chapter may not be construed to restrict a controller's or
27 processor's ability to:
28 A. Comply with federal laws or regulations, the laws and rules of the State or local
29 laws and ordinances;
30 B. Comply with a civil, criminal or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena or
31 summons by a federal or Maine governmental authority, including a governmental
32 authority of a federally recognized Indian tribe in the State;
33 C. Cooperate with federal, tribal or Maine law enforcement agencies concerning
34 conduct or activity that the controller or processor reasonably and in good faith believes
35 may violate federal laws or regulations, the laws and rules of the State or local laws
36 and ordinances;
37 D. Investigate, establish, exercise, prepare for or defend legal claims;
38 E. Provide a product or service specifically requested by a consumer;
39 F. Perform under a contract to which a consumer is a party, including fulfilling the
40 terms of a written warranty;
41 G. Take steps at the request of a consumer prior to entering into a contract;
Page 19 - 132LR0014(01)
1 H. Take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life or physical
2 safety of the consumer or another individual and when the processing cannot be
3 manifestly based on another legal basis;
4 I. Prevent, detect, protect against, investigate, prosecute those responsible for or
5 respond to security incidents, identity theft, fraud, harassment, malicious or deceptive
6 activities or any other type of illegal activity;
7 J. Preserve the integrity or security of systems; or
8 K. Assist another controller or processor or a 3rd party with an obligation under this
9 chapter.
10 2. Internal use. The obligations imposed on a controller or processor under this chapter
11 do not restrict a controller's or processor's ability to collect, use or retain personal data for
12 internal use to:
13 A. Effectuate a product recall;
14 B. Identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality; or
15 C. Perform internal operations that:
16 (1) Are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer or can be
17 reasonably anticipated based on the consumer's existing relationship with the
18 controller; or
19 (2) Are otherwise compatible with processing data to provide a product or service
20 specifically requested by a consumer or performing under a contract to which the
21 consumer is a party.
22 3. Evidentiary privilege. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under
23 this chapter do not apply when compliance with this chapter by the controller or processor
24 would violate an evidentiary privilege under state law. This chapter may not be construed
25 to prevent a controller or processor from providing personal data concerning a consumer
26 to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under state law as part of a privileged
27 communication.
28 4. Exceptions to liability. This subsection limits the liability of a controller, processor
29 or 3rd-party controller for violations of this chapter by other persons.
30 A. A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a processor or a 3rd-party
31 controller in compliance with this chapter has not violated this chapter if the processor
32 or 3rd-party controller that receives the personal data violates this chapter as long as:
33 (1) At the time the disclosing controller or processor disclosed the personal data,
34 the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual knowledge that the
35 receiving processor or 3rd-party controller would violate this chapter; and
36 (2) At the time the disclosing controller or processor disclosed the personal data,
37 the disclosing controller or processor was, and remained, in compliance with its
38 obligations as the discloser of the personal data.
39 B. A 3rd-party controller or processor that receives personal data from a controller or
40 processor in compliance with this chapter is not in violation of this chapter for the
41 independent misconduct of the controller or processor from which the 3rd-party
42 controller or processor received the personal data.
Page 20 - 132LR0014(01)
1 5. Freedom of speech; freedom of the press; personal or household use. This
2 chapter may not be construed to:
3 A. Impose an obligation on a controller or processor that adversely affects the rights
4 or freedoms of any person, including, but not limited to, the rights of any person to
5 freedom of speech or freedom to engage in political activity or the right of freedom of
6 the press guaranteed in the United States Constitution, Amendment I; or
7 B. Apply to an individual's processing of personal data in the course of the individual's
8 purely personal or household activities.
9 6. Burden of proof. If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an exemption
10 in this section, the controller bears the burden of demonstrating that the processing qualifies
11 for the exemption and complies with the limitations in subsection 7.
12 7. Limitations. Personal data processed by a controller or processor pursuant to an
13 exemption in this section may be processed only to the extent that the processing is:
14 A. Subject to reasonable administrative, technical and physical measures to protect the
15 confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of the personal data and reduce reasonably
16 foreseeable risks of harm to consumers relating to the collection, use or retention of
17 personal data;
18 B. Reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section; and
19 C. Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the specific
20 purposes listed in this section.
21 8. Processing personal data pursuant to an exemption. A person that processes
22 personal data pursuant to an exemption in this section may not be considered a controller
23 solely based on that processing of personal data.
24 §9614. Enforcement
25 1. Violation as unfair trade practice; exclusive Attorney General enforcement. A
26 violation of this chapter constitutes an unfair trade practice under the Maine Unfair Trade
27 Practices Act, except that the provisions of Title 5, section 213 do not apply to this chapter
28 and except as provided in subsection 2. The Attorney General has the exclusive authority
29 to enforce violations of this chapter under the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act.
30 2. Discretionary notice and right to cure. Notwithstanding any provision of the
31 Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act to the contrary, before initiating any action under
32 subsection 1 for an alleged violation that occurs on or before April 1, 2027, if the Attorney
33 General believes that it is possible to cure the alleged violation, the Attorney General may
34 issue a notice of violation to the controller or processor that is allegedly violating this

23 SUMMARY
2244 This bill enacts the Maine Online Data Privacy Act, which takes effect July 1, 2026.
2255 The Act regulates the collection, use, processing, disclosure, sale and deletion of
2266 nonpublicly available personal data by a person that conducts business in this State or that
2277 produces products or services targeted to residents of this State, referred to in the Act as a
2288 "controller," if the personal data is linked or can be reasonably linked to an identified or
2299 identifiable individual who is a resident of this State, referred to in the Act as a "consumer,"
3300 or is linked or reasonably can be linked to a device that is linked or reasonably can be linked
3311 to an identified or identifiable consumer. Under the Act, a controller must limit the
3322 collection and processing of personal data to what is reasonably necessary and
3333 proportionate to provide or maintain a specific product or service requested by the
3344 consumer, except that the controller must limit the collection and processing of certain
3355 sensitive data to what is strictly necessary to provide or maintain a specific product or
3366 service requested by the consumer. Under the Act, "sensitive data" includes data revealing
3377 a consumer's race or ethnic origins, religious beliefs, mental or physical health conditions
3388 or diagnoses, sexual orientation, gender identity, citizenship or immigration status; genetic
3399 or biometric data; precise geolocation data; social security, driver's license or nondriver
4400 identification card numbers; specific financial or account access information; data of a
4411 minor under 18 years of age; or data concerning the consumer's status as the victim of a
4422 crime.
Page 22 - 132LR0014(01)
1 The Act establishes that consumers have the right to confirm whether a controller is
2 processing their data; correct inaccuracies in their personal data; require the controller to
3 delete any portion of their personal data that the controller is not required to maintain by
4 law; obtain a copy of their personal data in a format that can be readily transferred to
5 another controller; obtain a list of the 3rd parties to which the controller has sold personal
6 data; and opt out of the processing of their personal data for purposes of targeted
7 advertising, sale or consumer profiling. The Act also prohibits a controller from selling
8 any sensitive data; processing the personal data of a minor for purposes of targeted
9 advertising or sale; processing personal data in a manner that discriminates against a person
10 in violation of state or federal law; and retaliating against a consumer for exercising a
11 consumer's rights under the Act, except that a controller may offer different prices or
12 selection of goods in connection with a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide
13 loyalty or discount program.
14 The Act also requires a controller to provide consumers with a privacy notice
15 specifying how a consumer may exercise the consumer's rights under the Act; the
16 categories of personal data processed by the controller; the purposes for processing the
17 personal data; the categories of personal data transferred to 3rd parties; and the categories
18 of 3rd parties to whom personal data is shared. The controller must establish, implement
19 and maintain reasonable data security practices and a retention schedule that requires the
20 disposal of personal data by the controller either when deletion is required by law or when
21 the data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was processed and retention of
22 the data is not required by law. The controller must also require, by contract, that any
23 person who processes a consumer's personal data on behalf of the controller treats the
24 personal data confidentially and deletes or returns all personal data to the controller at the
25 end of the processing, unless retention of the data is required by law. If a controller engages
26 in a data processing activity that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer,
27 including processing any data for targeted advertising, sale or profiling or any processing
28 of sensitive data, the controller must conduct and document a data protection assessment
29 identifying and weighing the benefits and potential risks of the processing activity. The
30 controller may be required to disclose the data protection assessment to the Attorney
31 General, who must keep it confidential, when the assessment is relevant to an investigation
32 conducted by the Attorney General.
33 The Act further prohibits any person from establishing a geofence within 1,750 feet of
34 any in-person health care facility in the State, other than the operator of the facility, for the
35 purpose of identifying, tracking, collecting data from or sending a notification regarding
36 consumer health data to consumers who enter that area.
37 The provisions of the Act do not apply to specifically enumerated persons, including
38 the State, political subdivisions of the State and federally recognized Indian tribes in the
39 State; nonprofit organizations; institutions of higher education; federally registered national
40 securities associations; supervised financial organizations and service corporations; health
41 care facilities and health care practitioners as well as their affiliates that both qualify as
42 business associates and provide services only to covered entitites; state-licensed and
43 authorized insurers that are in compliance with applicable Maine laws governing insurer
44 data security and data privacy; and broadband Internet service providers to the extent those
45 providers are subject to the data privacy requirements of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title
46 35-A, section 9301. In addition, the provisions of the Act do not apply to specifically
Page 23 - 132LR0014(01)
417 enumerated types of data, including, for example: nonpublic personal information
428 regulated under the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; protected health information under
439 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996; personal data
540 regulated by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974; data processed and
551 maintained by the controller regarding an applicant for employment or employee to the
562 extent the data is collected and used within the context of that role; and data necessary for
573 the controller to administer benefits.
8 The Act also does not prohibit controllers from engaging in specifically enumerated
9 activities, including, for example: complying with state or federal law; complying with
10 investigations or subpoenas from federal, state or tribal governmental authorities;
11 cooperating with federal, tribal or Maine law enforcement agencies; providing a product or
12 service specifically requested by the consumer; protecting life and physical safety of
13 consumers; and preventing or responding to security incidents. The Act also does not
14 prohibit a controller from using personal data collected in a lawful manner to effectuate a
15 product recall, identify and repair technical errors and perform internal operations that are
16 reasonably aligned with a consumer's expectations or otherwise compatible with providing
17 the product or service specifically requested by the consumer.
18 Violations of the Act may be enforced exclusively by the Attorney General under the
19 Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act. If the violation occurs on or before April 1, 2027, the
20 Attorney General may provide a potential defendant with a notice of violation at least 60
21 days prior to initiating an enforcement action, during which time the potential defendant
22 may cure the violation to avoid the enforcement action. The Act further requires the
23 Attorney General to submit a report by February 1, 2027 to the joint standing committee of
24 the Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary matters regarding the implementation and
25 operation of the Act. The committee may report out legislation related to the report to the
26 133rd Legislature in 2027.

433 schedule that requires the disposal of personal data by the controller when the data is
444 required to be deleted by law or when the data is no longer necessary for the purpose

435 concerning the consumer, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose the sale
446 or processing, as well as the manner in which a consumer may exercise the right to opt out
457 of the sale or processing. The disclosure required under this subsection must be
468 prominently displayed on the controller's publicly accessible website and the language used

10 and reliable mechanisms for a consumer to submit a request to exercise each consumer
11 right under this chapter.

13 must take into account:
14 (1) The ways in which consumers normally interact with the controller;
15 (2) The need for secure and reliable communication of consumer requests; and
16 (3) The ability of the controller to verify the identity of a consumer making the
17 request.

22 a secure and reliable mechanism for a consumer to exercise the right to opt out under

25 website to a webpage that allows a consumer, an authorized agent of the consumer
26 or a person authorized by section 9606, subsection 4 to exercise the consumer's
27 rights, to opt out of any processing of the consumer's personal data for the purposes
28 of targeted advertising or profiling or any sale of personal data; or
29 (2) No later than July 1, 2026, allowing a consumer to opt out of any processing of
30 the consumer's personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising or profiling
31 or any sale of personal data through an opt-out preference signal sent, with the
32 consumer's consent, by a platform, technology or mechanism to the controller
33 indicating the consumer's intent to opt out of the processing or sale. The platform,
34 technology or mechanism:
35 (a) Must be consumer-friendly and easy to use by the average consumer;
36 (b) Must use clear, easy to understand and unambiguous language;
37 (c) Must be as consistent as possible with any other similar platform,
38 technology or mechanism required by federal or state law, rule or regulation;
39 (d) Must enable the controller to reasonably determine whether the consumer
40 is a resident of the State, which reasonable determination may be based on the
41 location associated with the consumer's Internet protocol address, and whether
Page 14 - 132LR0014(01)

412 the consumer has made a legitimate request to opt out of any such processing
423 or sale of the consumer's personal data;
3 (e) May not unfairly disadvantage another controller; and
4 (f) May not make use of a default setting but must require the consumer to
5 make an affirmative, freely given and unambiguous choice to opt out of any
6 such processing or sale of the consumer's personal data.
7 A controller that recognizes an opt-out preference signal that has been approved by the
8 laws of another state is considered to be in compliance with this paragraph.
9 D. If a consumer's decision to opt out of any processing of the consumer's personal data
10 for the purposes of targeted advertising or profiling or any sale of personal data through
11 an opt-out preference signal sent in accordance with paragraph C, subparagraph (2)
12 conflicts with the consumer's existing controller-specific privacy setting or the
13 consumer's voluntary participation in a controller's bona fide loyalty, rewards,
14 premium features, discounts or club card program, the controller may notify the
15 consumer of the conflict and provide the consumer a choice to confirm the controller-
16 specific privacy setting or participation that program.
17 §9609. Responsibilities of processors and controllers
18 1. Contract required. If a controller uses a processor to process personal data of a
19 consumer, the controller and the processor shall enter into a contract in accordance with
20 the requirements of this section that governs the processor's data processing procedures
21 with respect to processing performed on behalf of the controller.
22 A. The contract must be binding and must clearly set forth:
23 (1) Instructions for processing personal data;
24 (2) The nature and purpose of the processing;
25 (3) The type of personal data subject to processing;
26 (4) The duration of the processing; and
27 (5) The rights and obligations of the processor and the controller.
28 B. The contract must require that the processor:
29 (1) Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of
30 confidentiality with respect to the data;
31 (2) Establish, implement and maintain reasonable administrative, technical and
32 physical data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity and
33 accessibility of personal data, considering the volume and nature of the personal
34 data;
35 (3) Stop processing personal data on request by the controller made in accordance
36 with a consumer's authenticated request;
37 (4) At the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller
38 as requested at the end of the provision of service, unless retention of the personal
39 data is required by law;
Page 15 - 132LR0014(01)

1 (5) On the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all
2 information in the processor's possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's
3 compliance with the obligations in this chapter;
4 (6) After providing the controller an opportunity to object, engage a subcontractor
5 to assist with processing personal data on the controller's behalf only in accordance
6 with a written contract that requires the subcontractor to meet the processor's
7 obligations regarding the personal data under the processor's contract with the
8 controller;
9 (7) Allow and cooperate with reasonable assessments by the controller, the
10 controller's designated assessor or a qualified and independent assessor arranged
11 for by the processor to assess the processor's policies and technical and
12 organizational measures in support of the obligations under this chapter. An
13 assessment conducted under this subparagraph must be conducted using an
14 appropriate and accepted control standard framework and assessment procedure;
15 and
16 (8) On request of the controller, provide the controller with a report of an
17 assessment conducted under subparagraph (7).
18 2. Processor responsibilities. A processor shall:
19 A. Adhere to a contract with a controller and the instructions of the controller;
20 B. Assist the controller in meeting the controller's obligations under this chapter,
21 including:
22 (1) By employing appropriate technical and organizational measures as much as
23 reasonably practicable to fulfill the controller's obligation to respond to requests to
24 exercise consumer rights, considering the nature of processing and the information
25 available to the processor; and
26 (2) By assisting the controller in meeting the controller's obligations in relation to
27 the security of processing the personal data under this chapter and in relation to the
28 notification of a breach of the security of a system, as required by chapter 210-B;
29 and
30 C. Provide necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document
31 data protection assessments as required by section 9611.
32 3. Processing relationship liability. This section may not be construed to relieve a
33 controller or a processor from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by virtue
34 of the controller's or processor's role in the processing relationship in accordance with this
35 section.
36 4. Fact-based determination of role. The determination of whether a person is acting
37 as a controller or a processor with respect to a specific processing of personal data is a fact-
38 based determination that depends on the context in which the personal data is being
39 processed as described in this subsection.
40 A. A person is considered to be a controller if:
41 (1) The person is not limited in the person's processing of specific personal data in
42 accordance with a controller's instructions; or
Page 16 - 132LR0014(01)

1 (2) The person fails to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific
2 processing of personal data.
3 B. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a
4 specific processing of personal data remains a processor.
5 C. If a processor or 3rd party begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the
6 purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor is a controller
7 with respect to the processing and may be subject to an enforcement action under
8 section 9614.
9 5. Controller's duties unaffected. This section may not be construed to alter a
10 controller's obligation to limit a person's processing of personal data or to take steps to
11 ensure that a processor adheres to the controller's instructions.
12 §9610. Third-party responsibilities
13 1. Notice required. If a 3rd party intends to use or share a consumer's personal data
14 in a manner inconsistent with the disclosures made to the consumer at the time that the
15 personal data was collected, the 3rd party shall provide an affected consumer with notice
16 of the new or changed use or sharing of personal data before implementing the new or
17 changed use or sharing.
18 2. Method of notification. The 3rd party shall provide the notice required by
19 subsection 1 in a manner and at a time reasonably calculated to allow a consumer to
20 exercise the consumer's rights under this chapter.
21 §9611. Data protection assessments
22 1. Definition. For the purposes of this section, "processing activities that present a
23 heightened risk of harm to a consumer" means:
24 A. The processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising;
25 B. The sale of personal data;
26 C. The processing of sensitive data; and
27 D. The processing of personal data for the purposes of profiling, in which the profiling
28 presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:
29 (1) Unfair, abusive or deceptive treatment of a consumer;
30 (2) Having an unlawful disparate impact on a consumer;
31 (3) Financial, physical or reputational injury to a consumer;
32 (4) A physical or other intrusion on the solitude or seclusion, or the private affairs
33 or concerns, of a consumer, when the intrusion would be offensive to a reasonable
34 person; or
35 (5) Other substantial injury to a consumer.
36 2. Data protection assessments required. A controller shall conduct and document a
37 data protection assessment for each of the controller's processing activities that present a
38 heightened risk of harm to a consumer, including an assessment for each algorithm that is
39 used. A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing
40 operations that include similar activities.
Page 17 - 132LR0014(01)

1 3. Required elements. A data protection assessment required by subsection 2 must be
2 conducted in accordance with the requirements of this subsection.
3 A. The data protection assessment must identify and weigh the benefits that may flow
4 directly and indirectly from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other
5 interested parties and the public against:
6 (1) The potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with the processing
7 as mitigated by safeguards that may be employed by the controller to reduce these
8 risks; and
9 (2) The necessity and proportionality of processing in relation to the stated purpose
10 of the processing.
11 B. The controller shall factor into a data protection assessment:
12 (1) The use of de-identified data;
13 (2) The reasonable expectations of consumers;
14 (3) The context of the processing; and
15 (4) The relationship between the controller and the consumer whose personal data
16 will be processed.
17 4. Disclosure to Attorney General. The Attorney General may require that a
18 controller disclose to the Attorney General a data protection assessment that is relevant to
19 an investigation conducted by the Attorney General. The Attorney General may evaluate
20 the data protection assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in this
21 chapter.
22 5. Confidentiality. A data protection assessment is confidential and exempt from
23 disclosure under Title 1, chapter 13 but may be used by the Attorney General in an action
24 to enforce this chapter. To the extent that any information contained in a data protection
25 assessment disclosed to the Attorney General pursuant to this section includes information
26 subject to attorney-client privilege or work product protection, the disclosure does not
27 constitute a waiver of that privilege or protection.
28 6. Reciprocity. If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose
29 of complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection assessment
30 satisfies the requirements established in this section if the data protection assessment is
31 reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data protection assessment that would
32 otherwise be conducted in accordance with this section.
33 7. Deadlines for performing data protection assessments. A controller shall conduct
34 and document a data protection assessment as required by this section:
35 A. Within 6 months of the date that the controller first engages in a processing activity
36 that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer; and
37 B. Within 6 months of making a material change to any processing activity that presents
38 a heightened risk of harm to a consumer.
39 8. Application. The requirement to conduct a data protection assessment under this
40 section applies only to processing activities that occur on or after July 1, 2026.
41 §9612. De-identified data
Page 18 - 132LR0014(01)

1 1. Re-identification not required. This chapter may not be construed to require a
2 controller or processor to:
3 A. Re-identify de-identified data;
4 B. Maintain data in an identifiable form; or
5 C. Collect, obtain, retain or access any data or technology in order to be capable of
6 associating an authenticated consumer request with personal data.
7 2. Consumer requests. This chapter may not be construed to require a controller or
8 processor to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request if the controller:
9 A. Is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal data, or it
10 would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request with the
11 personal data;
12 B. Does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the consumer who is the
13 subject of the personal data, or associate the personal data with other personal data
14 about the same consumer; and
15 C. Does not sell the personal data to a 3rd party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the
16 personal data to a 3rd party other than a processor, except as otherwise allowed in this
17 chapter.
18 3. Contractual oversight. A controller that discloses de-identified data shall exercise
19 reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with contractual commitments to which the
20 de-identified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to address breaches of those
21 contractual commitments. Whether oversight is reasonable and whether steps taken to
22 address breaches of contractual commitments are appropriate depends in part on whether
23 the disclosed de-identified data would be considered sensitive data if the data were re-
24 identified.
25 §9613. Exemptions
26 1. Exempt activities. This chapter may not be construed to restrict a controller's or
27 processor's ability to:
28 A. Comply with federal laws or regulations, the laws and rules of the State or local
29 laws and ordinances;
30 B. Comply with a civil, criminal or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena or
31 summons by a federal or Maine governmental authority, including a governmental
32 authority of a federally recognized Indian tribe in the State;
33 C. Cooperate with federal, tribal or Maine law enforcement agencies concerning
34 conduct or activity that the controller or processor reasonably and in good faith believes
35 may violate federal laws or regulations, the laws and rules of the State or local laws
36 and ordinances;
37 D. Investigate, establish, exercise, prepare for or defend legal claims;
38 E. Provide a product or service specifically requested by a consumer;
39 F. Perform under a contract to which a consumer is a party, including fulfilling the
40 terms of a written warranty;
41 G. Take steps at the request of a consumer prior to entering into a contract;
Page 19 - 132LR0014(01)

1 H. Take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life or physical
2 safety of the consumer or another individual and when the processing cannot be
3 manifestly based on another legal basis;
4 I. Prevent, detect, protect against, investigate, prosecute those responsible for or
5 respond to security incidents, identity theft, fraud, harassment, malicious or deceptive
6 activities or any other type of illegal activity;
7 J. Preserve the integrity or security of systems; or
8 K. Assist another controller or processor or a 3rd party with an obligation under this
9 chapter.
10 2. Internal use. The obligations imposed on a controller or processor under this chapter
11 do not restrict a controller's or processor's ability to collect, use or retain personal data for
12 internal use to:
13 A. Effectuate a product recall;
14 B. Identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality; or
15 C. Perform internal operations that:
16 (1) Are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer or can be
17 reasonably anticipated based on the consumer's existing relationship with the
18 controller; or
19 (2) Are otherwise compatible with processing data to provide a product or service
20 specifically requested by a consumer or performing under a contract to which the
21 consumer is a party.
22 3. Evidentiary privilege. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under
23 this chapter do not apply when compliance with this chapter by the controller or processor
24 would violate an evidentiary privilege under state law. This chapter may not be construed
25 to prevent a controller or processor from providing personal data concerning a consumer
26 to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under state law as part of a privileged
27 communication.
28 4. Exceptions to liability. This subsection limits the liability of a controller, processor
29 or 3rd-party controller for violations of this chapter by other persons.
30 A. A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a processor or a 3rd-party
31 controller in compliance with this chapter has not violated this chapter if the processor
32 or 3rd-party controller that receives the personal data violates this chapter as long as:
33 (1) At the time the disclosing controller or processor disclosed the personal data,
34 the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual knowledge that the
35 receiving processor or 3rd-party controller would violate this chapter; and
36 (2) At the time the disclosing controller or processor disclosed the personal data,
37 the disclosing controller or processor was, and remained, in compliance with its
38 obligations as the discloser of the personal data.
39 B. A 3rd-party controller or processor that receives personal data from a controller or
40 processor in compliance with this chapter is not in violation of this chapter for the
41 independent misconduct of the controller or processor from which the 3rd-party
42 controller or processor received the personal data.
Page 20 - 132LR0014(01)

1 5. Freedom of speech; freedom of the press; personal or household use. This
2 chapter may not be construed to:
3 A. Impose an obligation on a controller or processor that adversely affects the rights
4 or freedoms of any person, including, but not limited to, the rights of any person to
5 freedom of speech or freedom to engage in political activity or the right of freedom of
6 the press guaranteed in the United States Constitution, Amendment I; or
7 B. Apply to an individual's processing of personal data in the course of the individual's
8 purely personal or household activities.
9 6. Burden of proof. If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an exemption
10 in this section, the controller bears the burden of demonstrating that the processing qualifies
11 for the exemption and complies with the limitations in subsection 7.
12 7. Limitations. Personal data processed by a controller or processor pursuant to an
13 exemption in this section may be processed only to the extent that the processing is:
14 A. Subject to reasonable administrative, technical and physical measures to protect the
15 confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of the personal data and reduce reasonably
16 foreseeable risks of harm to consumers relating to the collection, use or retention of
17 personal data;
18 B. Reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section; and
19 C. Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the specific
20 purposes listed in this section.
21 8. Processing personal data pursuant to an exemption. A person that processes
22 personal data pursuant to an exemption in this section may not be considered a controller
23 solely based on that processing of personal data.
24 §9614. Enforcement
25 1. Violation as unfair trade practice; exclusive Attorney General enforcement. A
26 violation of this chapter constitutes an unfair trade practice under the Maine Unfair Trade
27 Practices Act, except that the provisions of Title 5, section 213 do not apply to this chapter
28 and except as provided in subsection 2. The Attorney General has the exclusive authority
29 to enforce violations of this chapter under the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act.
30 2. Discretionary notice and right to cure. Notwithstanding any provision of the
31 Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act to the contrary, before initiating any action under
32 subsection 1 for an alleged violation that occurs on or before April 1, 2027, if the Attorney
33 General believes that it is possible to cure the alleged violation, the Attorney General may
34 issue a notice of violation to the controller or processor that is allegedly violating this
35 chapter. If the Attorney General issues a notice of violation to a controller or processor
36 under this subsection, the Attorney General may not bring an action to enforce the violation
37 unless the controller or processor fails to cure the violation within 60 days of receiving the
38 notice of violation. The Attorney General shall consider the following factors in deciding
39 whether to issue a notice of violation under this subsection:
40 A. The number of alleged violations;
41 B. The size and complexity of the controller or processor;
42 C. The nature and extent of the controller's or processor's processing activities;
Page 21 - 132LR0014(01)

1 D. The likelihood of injury to the public;
2 E. The degree to which the alleged violations affect the safety of persons and property;
3 F. Whether the alleged violation was likely caused by a human or technical error; and
4 G. The extent to which the controller or processor has previously violated this chapter
5 or similar laws.
6 Sec. 2. Report. By February 1, 2027, the Attorney General shall submit a report to
7 the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary matters
8 regarding the implementation and operation of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 10,
9 chapter 1057. The report must include, at a minimum, the following information:
10 1. The number of notices the Attorney General has issued under Title 10, section 9614,
11 subsection 2 and the nature of the violations alleged in the notices;
12 2. The number of persons sent a notice described in subsection 1 that conferred with
13 the Attorney General during the notice period described in Title 10, section 9614,
14 subsection 2 in a manner that alleviated the need for a civil action under the Maine Unfair
15 Trade Practices Act;
16 3. The number of civil actions brought by the Attorney General under the Maine Unfair
17 Trade Practices Act to enforce violations of Title 10, chapter 1057; and
18 4. Any recommendations the Attorney General has for improving the operation of Title
19 10, chapter 1057.
20 The joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary
21 matters may report out legislation related to the report to the 133rd Legislature in 2027.
22 Sec. 3. Effective date. This Act takes effect July 1, 2026.
23 SUMMARY
2244 This bill enacts the Maine Online Data Privacy Act, which takes effect July 1, 2026.
2255 The Act regulates the collection, use, processing, disclosure, sale and deletion of
2266 nonpublicly available personal data by a person that conducts business in this State or that
2277 produces products or services targeted to residents of this State, referred to in the Act as a
2288 "controller," if the personal data is linked or can be reasonably linked to an identified or
2299 identifiable individual who is a resident of this State, referred to in the Act as a "consumer,"
3300 or is linked or reasonably can be linked to a device that is linked or reasonably can be linked
3311 to an identified or identifiable consumer. Under the Act, a controller must limit the
3322 collection and processing of personal data to what is reasonably necessary and
3333 proportionate to provide or maintain a specific product or service requested by the
3344 consumer, except that the controller must limit the collection and processing of certain
3355 sensitive data to what is strictly necessary to provide or maintain a specific product or
3366 service requested by the consumer. Under the Act, "sensitive data" includes data revealing
3377 a consumer's race or ethnic origins, religious beliefs, mental or physical health conditions
3388 or diagnoses, sexual orientation, gender identity, citizenship or immigration status; genetic
3399 or biometric data; precise geolocation data; social security, driver's license or nondriver
4400 identification card numbers; specific financial or account access information; data of a
4411 minor under 18 years of age; or data concerning the consumer's status as the victim of a
4422 crime.
Page 22 - 132LR0014(01)

1 The Act establishes that consumers have the right to confirm whether a controller is
2 processing their data; correct inaccuracies in their personal data; require the controller to
3 delete any portion of their personal data that the controller is not required to maintain by
4 law; obtain a copy of their personal data in a format that can be readily transferred to
5 another controller; obtain a list of the 3rd parties to which the controller has sold personal
6 data; and opt out of the processing of their personal data for purposes of targeted
7 advertising, sale or consumer profiling. The Act also prohibits a controller from selling
8 any sensitive data; processing the personal data of a minor for purposes of targeted
9 advertising or sale; processing personal data in a manner that discriminates against a person
10 in violation of state or federal law; and retaliating against a consumer for exercising a
11 consumer's rights under the Act, except that a controller may offer different prices or
12 selection of goods in connection with a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide
13 loyalty or discount program.
14 The Act also requires a controller to provide consumers with a privacy notice
15 specifying how a consumer may exercise the consumer's rights under the Act; the
16 categories of personal data processed by the controller; the purposes for processing the
17 personal data; the categories of personal data transferred to 3rd parties; and the categories
18 of 3rd parties to whom personal data is shared. The controller must establish, implement
19 and maintain reasonable data security practices and a retention schedule that requires the
20 disposal of personal data by the controller either when deletion is required by law or when
21 the data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was processed and retention of
22 the data is not required by law. The controller must also require, by contract, that any
23 person who processes a consumer's personal data on behalf of the controller treats the
24 personal data confidentially and deletes or returns all personal data to the controller at the
25 end of the processing, unless retention of the data is required by law. If a controller engages
26 in a data processing activity that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer,
27 including processing any data for targeted advertising, sale or profiling or any processing
28 of sensitive data, the controller must conduct and document a data protection assessment
29 identifying and weighing the benefits and potential risks of the processing activity. The
30 controller may be required to disclose the data protection assessment to the Attorney
31 General, who must keep it confidential, when the assessment is relevant to an investigation
32 conducted by the Attorney General.
33 The Act further prohibits any person from establishing a geofence within 1,750 feet of
34 any in-person health care facility in the State, other than the operator of the facility, for the
35 purpose of identifying, tracking, collecting data from or sending a notification regarding
36 consumer health data to consumers who enter that area.
37 The provisions of the Act do not apply to specifically enumerated persons, including
38 the State, political subdivisions of the State and federally recognized Indian tribes in the
39 State; nonprofit organizations; institutions of higher education; federally registered national
40 securities associations; supervised financial organizations and service corporations; health
41 care facilities and health care practitioners as well as their affiliates that both qualify as
42 business associates and provide services only to covered entitites; state-licensed and
43 authorized insurers that are in compliance with applicable Maine laws governing insurer
44 data security and data privacy; and broadband Internet service providers to the extent those
45 providers are subject to the data privacy requirements of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title
46 35-A, section 9301. In addition, the provisions of the Act do not apply to specifically
Page 23 - 132LR0014(01)

417 enumerated types of data, including, for example: nonpublic personal information
428 regulated under the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; protected health information under
439 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996; personal data
540 regulated by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974; data processed and
551 maintained by the controller regarding an applicant for employment or employee to the
562 extent the data is collected and used within the context of that role; and data necessary for
573 the controller to administer benefits.
8 The Act also does not prohibit controllers from engaging in specifically enumerated
9 activities, including, for example: complying with state or federal law; complying with
10 investigations or subpoenas from federal, state or tribal governmental authorities;
11 cooperating with federal, tribal or Maine law enforcement agencies; providing a product or
12 service specifically requested by the consumer; protecting life and physical safety of
13 consumers; and preventing or responding to security incidents. The Act also does not
14 prohibit a controller from using personal data collected in a lawful manner to effectuate a
15 product recall, identify and repair technical errors and perform internal operations that are
16 reasonably aligned with a consumer's expectations or otherwise compatible with providing
17 the product or service specifically requested by the consumer.
18 Violations of the Act may be enforced exclusively by the Attorney General under the
19 Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act. If the violation occurs on or before April 1, 2027, the
20 Attorney General may provide a potential defendant with a notice of violation at least 60
21 days prior to initiating an enforcement action, during which time the potential defendant
22 may cure the violation to avoid the enforcement action. The Act further requires the
23 Attorney General to submit a report by February 1, 2027 to the joint standing committee of
24 the Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary matters regarding the implementation and
25 operation of the Act. The committee may report out legislation related to the report to the
26 133rd Legislature in 2027.
