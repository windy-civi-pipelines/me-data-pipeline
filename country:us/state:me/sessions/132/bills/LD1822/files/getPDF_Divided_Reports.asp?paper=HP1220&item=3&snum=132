39 C. When the controller, under the circumstances, has actual knowledge or willfully
40 disregards that the consumer is at least 13 years of age but has not attained 16 years of
41 age:
Page 10 - 132LR0014(03)

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 1220, L.D. 1822
1 (1) Process the personal data of the consumer for purposes of targeted advertising;
2 or
3 (2) Sell the consumer's personal data without the consumer's consent; or
4 D. Retaliate against a consumer for exercising a consumer right in this chapter or for
5 not agreeing to the collection or processing of personal data for a separate product or
6 service, including by denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for
7 goods or services or providing a different level of quality of goods or services to the
8 consumer.
9 4. Loyalty and rewards programs. Subsection 3 may not be construed to require a
10 controller to provide a product or service that requires the personal data of a consumer that
11 the controller does not collect or maintain or prohibit a controller from offering a different
12 rate, level, quality or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods
13 or services for no fee, if the offering is in connection with a consumer's voluntary
14 participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts or club card
15 program.
16 5. Privacy notice. A controller shall provide consumers with an accessible, clear and
17 meaningful privacy notice in plain language that is understandable by a reasonable
18 consumer that includes:
19 A. The categories of personal data processed by the controller;
20 B. The purpose for processing personal data;
21 C. How consumers may exercise their consumer rights, including how a consumer
22 may appeal a controller's decision with regard to the consumer's request;
23 D. The categories of personal data that the controller shares with 3rd parties, if any;
24 E. The categories of 3rd parties, if any, with which the controller shares personal data;
25 and
26 F. An active e-mail address or other mechanism that the consumer may use to contact
27 the controller.
28 6. Consumer rights request mechanism. A controller shall establish, and shall
29 describe in a privacy notice, one or more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit
30 a request to exercise a consumer right pursuant to this chapter. The design of the secure
31 and reliable means must take into account the ways in which consumers normally interact
32 with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication of requests and the
33 ability of the controller to verify the identity of the consumer making the request. A
34 controller may not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise a
35 consumer right, but may require a consumer to use an existing account.
36 7. Notice of sale and targeted advertising; opt-out mechanism. If a controller sells
37 personal data to a 3rd party or processes personal data for targeted advertising, the
38 controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose such processing, as well as the manner
39 in which a consumer may exercise the right to opt out of such processing. The disclosure
40 required under this section must include:
41 A. A clear and conspicuous link titled "Do Not Sell My Personal Data" or bearing a
42 substantially similar title on the controller's publicly accessible website that directs the
Page 11 - 132LR0014(03)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 1220, L.D. 1822
413 consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to a publicly accessible website that enables
424 the consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to opt out of the sale of the consumer's
435 personal data; and
4 B. A clear and conspicuous link titled "Opt Me Out of Targeted Advertising" or
5 bearing a substantially similar title on the controller's publicly accessible website that
6 directs the consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to a publicly accessible website that
7 enables the consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to opt out of processing of the
8 consumer's personal data for targeted advertising.
9 In lieu of providing the 2 links described in paragraphs A and B, a controller may satisfy
10 the requirements of this subsection by providing a single conspicuous and clearly labeled
11 link on the controller's publicly accessible website that allows a consumer, or an agent of
12 the consumer, both to opt out of the sale of the consumer's personal data and to opt out of
13 the processing of the consumer's personal data for targeted advertising. If the controller
14 maintains a specific section or page of its publicly accessible website that allows a
15 consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to opt out of the sale of the consumer's data or the
16 processing of the consumer's data for targeted advertising and to select additional privacy
17 controls, the controller may satisfy the requirements of this subsection by providing a single
18 conspicuous and clearly labeled link on the controller's publicly accessible website titled
19 "Your Privacy Choices" or bearing a substantially similar title that directs the consumer, or
20 an agent of the consumer, to that specific section or page of its publicly accessible website.
21 8. Universal opt-out mechanism. No later than December 1, 2027, a controller shall
22 allow a consumer to opt out of any processing of the consumer's personal data for the
23 purposes of targeted advertising or any sale of personal data through an opt-out preference
24 signal sent, with the consumer's consent, by a platform, technology or mechanism to the
25 controller indicating the consumer's intent to opt out of any such processing or sale. The
26 platform, technology or mechanism:
27 A. Must be consumer-friendly and easy to use by the average consumer;
28 B. May not unfairly disadvantage another controller;
29 C. May not make use of a default setting but must require the consumer to make an
30 affirmative, freely given and unambiguous choice to opt out of any such processing or
31 sale of the consumer's personal data;
32 D. Must be as consistent as possible with another similar platform, technology or
33 mechanism required by federal or state law; and
34 E. Must enable the controller to reasonably determine whether the consumer is a
35 resident of this State and whether the consumer has made a legitimate request to opt
36 out of to the sale of the consumer's personal data or targeted advertising.
37 A controller that recognizes an opt-out preference signal that has been approved by the
38 laws or regulations of another state is in compliance with this subsection.
39 §9607. Responsibilities of processors and controllers
40 1. Processor responsibilities. A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a
41 controller and shall assist the controller in meeting the controller's obligations under this
42 chapter. Assistance provided under this section must include:
Page 12 - 132LR0014(03)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 1220, L.D. 1822
1 A. Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the
2 processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, so far as is reasonably
3 practicable, to fulfill the controller's obligation to respond to a consumer rights request;
4 B. Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the
5 processor, by assisting the controller in meeting the controller's obligations in relation
6 to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to the notification of a
7 breach of security, as required by chapter 210-B, of the system of the processor, in
8 order to meet the controller's obligations; and
9 C. Providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document
10 data protection assessments.
11 2. Contractual requirements. A contract between a controller and a processor must
12 govern the processor's data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on
13 behalf of the controller. The contract must clearly set forth instructions for processing data,
14 the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of
15 processing and the rights and obligations of both parties. The contract must require that
16 the processor:
17 A. Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of
18 confidentiality with respect to the data;
19 B. At the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller as
20 requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data
21 is required by law;
22 C. On the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all
23 information in the processor's possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's
24 compliance with the obligations in this chapter;
25 D. Allow and cooperate with reasonable assessments by the controller or the
26 controller's designated assessor or arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to
27 conduct an assessment of the processor's policies and technical and organizational
28 measures in support of the obligations in this chapter, using an appropriate and
29 accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for the assessment.
30 The processor shall provide a report of the assessment to the controller upon request;
31 and
32 E. Engage a subcontractor pursuant to a written contract that requires the subcontractor
33 to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data.
34 3. Processing relationship liability. This section may not be construed to relieve a
35 controller or processor from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by virtue
36 of the controller's or processor's role in the processing relationship as described in this
37 chapter.
38 4. Fact-based determination. Determining whether a person is acting as a controller
39 or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that
40 depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed. A person who is not
41 limited in the person's processing of personal data pursuant to a controller's instructions, or
42 who fails to adhere to the instructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to a
43 specific processing of data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's
44 instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If
Page 13 - 132LR0014(03)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 1220, L.D. 1822
415 a processor begins, alone or jointly with other persons, determining the purposes and means
426 of the processing of personal data, the processor acts as a controller with respect to the
437 processing and may be subject to an enforcement action under section 9611.
4 §9608. Data protection assessments
5 1. Documentation. A controller shall conduct and document a data protection
6 assessment for each of the controller's processing activities that presents a heightened risk
7 of harm to a consumer. For the purposes of this section, "processing activity that presents
8 a heightened risk of harm to a consumer" includes:
9 A. The processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising;
10 B. The sale of personal data;
11 C. The processing of personal data for the purposes of profiling, when profiling
12 presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:
13 (1) Unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on, consumers;
14 (2) Financial, physical or reputational injury to consumers;
15 (3) A physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the private
16 affairs or concerns, of consumers, when the intrusion would be offensive to a
17 reasonable person; or
18 (4) Other substantial injury to consumers; and
19 D. The processing of sensitive data.
20 2. Required elements. Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection
21 1 must identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and indirectly, from the
22 processing to the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders and the public against the
23 potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with the processing, as mitigated by
24 safeguards that can be employed by the controller to reduce the risks. The controller shall
25 factor into the data protection assessment the use of de-identified data and the reasonable
26 expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the processing and the relationship
27 between the controller and the consumer whose personal data will be processed.
28 3. Attorney General disclosure; exemption from public records. The Attorney
29 General may require that a controller disclose a data protection assessment that is relevant
30 to an investigation conducted by the Attorney General, and the controller shall make the
31 data protection assessment available to the Attorney General. The Attorney General may
32 evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in
33 this chapter. A data protection assessment is confidential and exempt from disclosure under
34 Title 1, chapter 13. To the extent information contained in a data protection assessment
35 disclosed to the Attorney General includes information subject to attorney-client privilege
36 or work product protection, the disclosure does not constitute a waiver of that privilege or
37 protection.
38 4. Processing activity. A single data protection assessment may address a comparable
39 set of processing operations that include similar activities.
40 5. Reciprocity. If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose
41 of complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection assessment
42 satisfies the requirements established in this section if the data protection assessment is
Page 14 - 132LR0014(03)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 1220, L.D. 1822
413 reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data protection assessment that would
424 otherwise be conducted pursuant to this section.
3 6. Application. A controller is not required to conduct a data protection assessment
4 under this section for any processing activity created or initiated before July 1, 2026.
5 §9609. De-identified and pseudonymous data
6 1. De-identified data requirements. A controller in possession of de-identified data
7 shall:
8 A. Take reasonable measures to ensure that the data cannot be associated with an
9 individual;
10 B. Publicly commit to maintaining and using de-identified data without attempting to
11 re-identify the data; and
12 C. Contractually obligate recipients of the de-identified data to comply with all
13 provisions of this chapter.
14 2. De-identified data and pseudonymous re-identification of data. This chapter
15 may not be construed to require a controller or processor to:
16 A. Re-identify de-identified data or pseudonymous data; or
17 B. Maintain data in identifiable form, or collect, obtain, retain or access data or
18 technology, in order to be capable of associating an authenticated consumer request
19 with personal data.
20 3. Consumer requests. This chapter may not be construed to require a controller or
21 processor to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request if the controller:
22 A. Is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal data, or it
23 would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request with the
24 personal data;
25 B. Does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the consumer who is the
26 subject of the personal data, or associate the personal data with other personal data
27 about the same consumer; and
28 C. Does not sell the personal data to a 3rd party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the
29 personal data to a 3rd party other than a processor, except as otherwise permitted in
30 this section.
31 4. Pseudonymous data requirements. The rights afforded under section 9604,
32 subsection 1 do not apply to pseudonymous data in cases when the controller is able to
33 demonstrate that information necessary to identify the consumer is kept separately and is
34 subject to effective technical and organizational controls that prevent the controller from
35 accessing the information.
36 5. Contractual oversight. A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or de-
37 identified data shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with contractual
38 commitments to which the pseudonymous data or de-identified data is subject and shall
39 take appropriate steps to address breaches of those contractual commitments.

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 1220, L.D. 1822
1 1. Exempt controller and processor activities. This chapter may not be construed
2 to restrict a controller's or processor's ability to:
3 A. Comply with federal laws or regulations or the laws or rules of a state;
4 B. Comply with a civil, criminal or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena or
5 summons by federal or state governmental authorities or governmental authorities of a
6 federally recognized Indian tribe in this State;
7 C. Cooperate with federal, tribal or state law enforcement agencies concerning conduct
8 or activity that the controller or processor reasonably and in good faith believes may
9 violate federal laws or regulations or the laws and rules of a state;

11 E. Provide a product or service specifically requested by a consumer;
12 F. Perform under a contract to which a consumer is a party, including fulfilling the
13 terms of a written warranty;
14 G. Take steps at the request of a consumer prior to entering into a contract;
15 H. Take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life or physical
16 safety of the consumer or another individual and when the processing cannot be
17 manifestly based on another legal basis;
18 I. Prevent, detect, protect against or respond to security incidents, identity theft, fraud,
19 harassment, malicious or deceptive activities or illegal activity or preserve the integrity
20 or security of systems or investigate, report or prosecute those responsible for an action
21 described in this paragraph;
22 J. Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific or statistical research in the public
23 interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws and is approved,
24 monitored and governed by an institutional review board that determines, or similar
25 independent oversight entities that determine:
26 (1) Whether the deletion of the information is likely to provide substantial benefits
27 that do not exclusively accrue to the controller;
28 (2) Whether the expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks; and
29 (3) Whether the controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate
30 privacy risks associated with research, including risks associated with
31 re-identification;
32 K. Assist another controller, processor or 3rd party with obligations under this chapter;
33 or
34 L. Process personal data for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, but
35 solely to the extent that the processing is:
36 (1) Subject to suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights of the
37 consumer whose personal data is being processed; and
38 (2) Under the responsibility of a professional subject to confidentiality obligations
39 under federal or state laws or local ordinances.
Page 16 - 132LR0014(03)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 1220, L.D. 1822
1 2. Internal use. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this
2 chapter do not restrict a controller's or processor's ability to collect, use or retain data for
3 internal use to:
4 A. Conduct internal research to develop, improve or repair products, services or
5 technology;
6 B. Effectuate a product recall;
7 C. Identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality;
8 or
9 D. Perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the
10 consumer or reasonably anticipated based on the consumer's existing relationship with
11 the controller, or are otherwise compatible with processing data in furtherance of the
12 provision of a product or service specifically requested by a consumer or the
13 performance of a contract to which the consumer is a party.
14 3. Evidentiary privilege. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under
15 this chapter do not apply when compliance with this chapter by the controller or processor
16 would violate an evidentiary privilege under the laws of this State. This chapter may not
17 be construed to prevent a controller or processor from providing personal data concerning
18 a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of this State as
19 part of a privileged communication.
20 4. Liability. A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a 3rd-party
21 processor or 3rd-party controller in accordance with this chapter has not violated this
22 chapter if the 3rd-party processor or 3rd-party controller that receives and processes the
23 personal data violates this chapter, as long as, at the time the disclosing controller or
24 processor disclosed the personal data, the disclosing controller or processor did not have
25 actual knowledge that the receiving 3rd-party processor or 3rd-party controller would
26 violate this chapter. A 3rd-party controller or 3rd-party processor receiving personal data
27 from a controller or processor in compliance with this chapter is likewise not in violation
28 of this chapter for the transgressions of the controller or processor from which the 3rd-party
29 controller or 3rd-party processor receives the personal data.
30 5. Exemptions. This chapter may not be construed to:
31 A. Impose an obligation on a controller or processor that adversely affects the rights
32 or freedoms of a person, including, but not limited to, the rights of a person:
33 (1) To freedom of speech or freedom of the press guaranteed in the United States
34 Constitution, Amendment I; or
35 (2) Under Title 16, section 61; or
36 B. Apply to a person's processing of personal data in the course of the person's purely
37 personal or household activities.
38 6. Limitations. Personal data processed by a controller or processor pursuant to this
39 section may be processed only to the extent that the processing is:
40 A. Reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section; and
41 B. Adequate, relevant and limited to what is reasonably necessary in relation to the
42 specific purposes listed in this section. Personal data collected, used or retained
Page 17 - 132LR0014(03)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 1220, L.D. 1822
413 pursuant to subsection 2 must, when applicable, take into account the nature and
424 purpose of the collection, use or retention. The data must be subject to reasonable
435 administrative, technical and physical measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity
446 and accessibility of the personal data and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of
457 harm to consumers relating to the collection, use or retention of personal data.
6 7. Controller burden. If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an
7 exemption in this section, the controller bears the burden of demonstrating that the
8 processing qualifies for the exemption and complies with the limitations in subsection 6.
9 8. Clarification of roles. Processing personal data for the purposes expressly
10 identified in this section does not solely make a legal entity a controller with respect to the
11 processing.
12 §9611. Enforcement
13 1. Violation as unfair trade practice; exclusive Attorney General enforcement. A
14 violation of this chapter constitutes an unfair trade practice under the Maine Unfair Trade
15 Practices Act, except that the rulemaking provisions of Title 5, section 207, subsection 2
16 do not apply to this chapter and except as provided in subsections 2 and 3. The Attorney
17 General has the exclusive authority to enforce violations of this chapter under the Maine
18 Unfair Trade Practices Act.
19 2. Notice. Notwithstanding any provision of Title 5, section 209 to the contrary, at
20 least 30 days prior to commencement of any action under the Maine Unfair Trade Practices
21 Act to enforce this chapter, the Attorney General shall notify the person against whom an
22 action may be brought of the intended action and give the person an opportunity to cure the
23 alleged violation or violations. The Attorney General may bring an action pursuant to this
24 section only if the controller fails to cure one or more of the alleged violations described in
25 the notice within 30 days of receiving the notice.
26 3. No private right of action. Notwithstanding Title 5, section 213, this chapter may
27 not be construed as creating a private right of action under this chapter or any other
28 provision of law against any person based on a violation of any provision of this chapter or
29 any other law.
30 4. Preemption. This chapter supersedes and preempts any ordinance, resolution, rule
31 or other regulation adopted by a political subdivision of the State regarding the processing
32 of personal data by a controller or processor.
33 §9612. Maine Privacy Fund established
34 1. Establishment; purpose. The Maine Privacy Fund, referred to in this section as
35 the "fund," is established within the Department of the Attorney General as a nonlapsing
36 fund to providing funding for the staff and activities of the department necessary to enforce
37 the provisions of this chapter.
38 2. Administration. The Department of the Attorney General shall administer the
39 fund. The fund must be established and held separate and apart from any other funds or
40 money of the State or the department and must be used and administered exclusively for
41 purposes authorized in this section. The fund consists of:
42 A. Any civil penalties, attorney's fees or costs awarded to the State in an action brought
43 by the Attorney General to enforce a violation of this chapter;

4 D. Other funds received from any public or private source, including grants, gifts,
5 bequests and donations.
6 Sec. 2. 35-A MRSA c. 94, as amended, is repealed.
7 Sec. 3. Report. By February 1, 2027, the Attorney General shall submit a report to
8 the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary matters
9 regarding the operation and implementation of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 10,
10 chapter 1057. The report must include, at a minimum, the following information:

16 Trade Practices Act;
17 3. The number of civil actions brought by the Attorney General under the Maine Unfair

13 SUMMARY
1144 This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, replaces the bill and
1155 changes the title.
16 The amendment enacts the Maine Consumer Data Privacy Act, which takes effect July
17 1, 2026. The Act regulates the collection, use, processing, disclosure, sale and deletion of
18 nonpublicly available personal data that is linked or reasonably linkable to an individual
19 who is a resident of the State, referred to in the Act as a "consumer," or that is linked or
20 reasonably linkable to an identifiable consumer's device, by a person that conducts business
21 in this State or that produces products or services targeted to residents of this State, referred
22 to in the Act as a "controller." Under the Act, a controller must limit the collection of
23 personal data to what is adequate, relevant and reasonably necessary in relation to the
24 purposes for which the controller processes that data, as disclosed in a privacy notice
25 specifying the categories of personal data processed by the controller, the purposes for
26 processing the personal data, the categories of personal data transferred to 3rd parties and
27 the categories of 3rd parties to whom personal data is shared. The controller must also
28 process the minimum amount of personal data reasonably necessary, adequate or relevant
29 for each disclosed processing purpose.
30 A consumer has the right, under the Act, to confirm whether a controller is processing
31 the consumer's personal data; to require the controller to correct inaccuracies in or delete
32 the consumer's personal data; to obtain a copy of the consumer's personal data; and to opt
33 out of the processing of the consumer's personal data for purposes of targeted advertising,
34 sale or profiling in furtherance of decisions about the consumer's access to financial or
35 lending services, housing, insurance, education, criminal justice, employment
36 opportunities, health care services and essential goods and services. The privacy notice
37 must describe how a consumer may exercise these rights. The controller must obtain the
38 affirmative, informed consent of a consumer before processing the consumer's sensitive
39 data, including data revealing the consumer's race or ethnic origins, religious beliefs,
40 medical history or mental or physical health conditions or diagnoses, sexual orientation or
41 citizenship or immigration status; genetic or biometric data; precise geolocation data; data
42 of a known child who has not attained 13 years of age; social security, driver's license or
43 nondriver identification card number; information that permits access to a consumer's
44 financial account; or data concerning the consumer's status as the victim of a crime. If the

415 controller knows that the consumer has not attained 13 years of age, the controller may not
426 process the consumer's data for any purpose without parental consent. If the controller
437 knows or willfully disregards that the consumer is at least 13 years of age but has not
448 attained 16 years of age, the controller may not process the consumer's data for targeted
459 advertising and must obtain the consumer's consent before processing the consumer's data
560 for sale.
7 The Act prohibits a controller from processing data in a manner that discriminates
8 against a person in violation of state or federal law. A controller is also prohibited from
9 retaliating against a consumer for exercising the consumer's rights under the Act, except
10 that a controller may offer different prices or selection of goods in connection with a
11 consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty or discount program. A controller
12 must establish, implement and maintain reasonable data security practices. Beginning July
13 1, 2026, if a controller engages in a data processing activity that presents a heightened risk
14 of harm to a consumer, including processing any data for targeted advertising, sale or
15 profiling or any processing of sensitive data, the controller must conduct and document a
16 data protection assessment to identify and weigh the benefits and potential risks of the
17 processing activity. The controller may be required to disclose the data protection
18 assessment to the Attorney General, who must keep it confidential, when the assessment is
19 relevant to an investigation conducted by the Attorney General.
20 The provisions of the Act do not apply to specifically enumerated persons, including
21 the State, political subdivisions of the State and federally recognized Indian tribes in the
22 State; financial institutions or their affiliates subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley
23 Act; state-licensed and authorized insurers; covered entities and business associates subject
24 to the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996; motor vehicle
25 dealer franchisees; nonprofits that do not receive any revenue from the sale of personal data
26 or that detect and prevent fraudulent insurance acts; and persons that both processed the
27 personal data of fewer than 25,000 consumers in the preceding calendar year and derived
28 no more than 25% of gross revenue from the sale of personal data. The Act also does not
29 apply to persons that controlled or processed the personal data for purposes other than
30 completing payment transactions of fewer than 100,000 consumers in the preceding
31 calendar year, except that, beginning January 1, 2028, this exception applies only to persons
32 that controlled or processed the personal data for purposes other than completing payment
33 transactions of fewer than 50,000 consumers in the preceding calendar year.
34 In addition, the provisions of the Act do not apply to specifically enumerated types of
35 data, including: nonpublic personal information regulated under the federal Gramm-Leach-
36 Bliley Act; health care information protected under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22,
37 section 1711-C; protected health information under the federal Health Insurance Portability
38 and Accountability Act of 1996; personal data regulated by the Family Educational Rights
39 and Privacy Act of 1974; data processed and maintained by the controller regarding an
40 applicant for employment or employee to the extent the data is collected and used within
41 the context of that role; and data necessary for the controller to administer benefits. The
42 Maine Consumer Data Privacy Act also does not prohibit controllers from engaging in
43 specifically enumerated activities, including complying with state or federal law;
44 complying with investigations or subpoenas from governmental authorities including the
45 Federal Government and the government of a state or a federally recognized Indian tribe
46 in the State; cooperating with federal, state or tribal law enforcement agencies; providing

417 a product or service specifically requested by the consumer; protecting life and physical
428 safety of consumers and preventing or responding to security incidents; and conducting
439 internal product research, effectuating a product recall or performing other internal
540 operations aligned with the expectations of a consumer.
5 Violations of the Act may be enforced exclusively by the Attorney General under the
6 Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act. The Attorney General is required to provide a potential
7 defendant with at least 30 days' notice prior to initiating an enforcement action, during
8 which time the potential defendant may cure any violation alleged in the notice. Any civil
9 penalties, attorney's fees or costs awarded to the State for a violation of the Act must be
10 deposited in the Maine Privacy Fund, which is established to provide funding for the
11 enforcement staff and activities of the Department of the Attorney General. The Act further
12 requires the Attorney General to submit a report by February 1, 2027 to the joint standing
13 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary matters regarding the
14 operation and implementation of the Act. The committee may report out legislation related
15 to the report to the 133rd Legislature in 2027.
16 The amendment also repeals the current law governing the privacy of broadband
17 Internet access service customer personal information because broadband Internet access
18 service providers are subject to the provisions of the Act.
