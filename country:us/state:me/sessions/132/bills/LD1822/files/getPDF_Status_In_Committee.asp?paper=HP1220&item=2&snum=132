5 SUMMARY
66 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, makes the following
77 changes to the bill.
8 1. It changes the effective date of the Maine Online Data Privacy Act from July 1, 2026
9 to September 1, 2026.
10 2. It clarifies that the term "process" does not include the collection of personal data
11 and makes technical changes throughout the bill to address the difference between
12 collection and processing of personal data and sensitive data.
13 3. It amends the definition of "publicly available information" to exclude any
14 information used to create a consumer profile, any information made available for sale and
15 inferences derived from these types of information.
16 4. It clarifies the types of consumer financial information that are considered "sensitive
17 data" under the Act.
18 5. It provides that the Act does not prohibit the transfer of personal data as part of the
19 transfer of assets to a 3rd party in the context of a merger, acquisition or bankruptcy as long
20 as the controller provides an affected consumer with a notice describing the transfer,
21 including the name of the entity acquiring the personal data and the entity's privacy policies
22 as well as a reasonable opportunity for the consumer to withdraw any previous consent
23 related to the consumer's personal data and to request deletion of the consumer's personal
24 data.
25 6. It exempts personal data collected and used pursuant to the federal Controlled
26 Substances Act, 21 United States Code, Section 830, from the scope of the Act.
27 7. It provides that, although a controller must limit the collection of personal data to
28 what is reasonably necessary and proportionate to provide or maintain a specific product
29 or service requested by the consumer, such services include routine administrative,
30 operational, website or account-servicing activities that are consistent with the reasonable
31 expectations of the consumer under the circumstances, including collection of the
32 consumer's personal data to provide advertising to the consumer based on the consumer's
33 activities within the controller's own websites or online applications.
34 8. It removes the provision of the bill that requires a processor to provide a controller
35 an opportunity to object to the processor's engaging of a subcontractor, but retains the
36 provision of the bill requiring the processor to require any subcontractor to assist with
37 processing only in accordance with a written contract that requires the subcontractor to
38 meet the processor's obligations regarding the personal data under the processor's contract
39 with the controller.
40 9. It removes the provision of the bill requiring 3rd parties to provide specific notices
41 to consumers.

5 standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary matters regarding

5 SUMMARY
66 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, makes the following
77 changes to the bill.
8 1. It changes the effective date of the Maine Online Data Privacy Act from July 1, 2026
9 to September 1, 2026.
10 2. It clarifies that the term "process" does not include the collection of personal data
11 and makes technical changes throughout the bill to address the difference between
12 collection and processing of personal data and sensitive data.
13 3. It amends the definition of "publicly available information" to exclude any
14 information used to create a consumer profile, any information made available for sale and
15 inferences derived from these types of information.
16 4. It clarifies the types of consumer financial information that are considered "sensitive
17 data" under the Act.
18 5. It provides that the Act does not prohibit the transfer of personal data as part of the
19 transfer of assets to a 3rd party in the context of a merger, acquisition or bankruptcy as long
20 as the controller provides an affected consumer with a notice describing the transfer,
21 including the name of the entity acquiring the personal data and the entity's privacy policies
22 as well as a reasonable opportunity for the consumer to withdraw any previous consent
23 related to the consumer's personal data and to request deletion of the consumer's personal
24 data.
25 6. It exempts personal data collected and used pursuant to the federal Controlled
26 Substances Act, 21 United States Code, Section 830, from the scope of the Act.
27 7. It provides that, although a controller must limit the collection of personal data to
28 what is reasonably necessary and proportionate to provide or maintain a specific product
29 or service requested by the consumer, such services include routine administrative,
30 operational, website or account-servicing activities that are consistent with the reasonable
31 expectations of the consumer under the circumstances, including collection of the
32 consumer's personal data to provide advertising to the consumer based on the consumer's
33 activities within the controller's own websites or online applications.
34 8. It removes the provision of the bill that requires a processor to provide a controller
35 an opportunity to object to the processor's engaging of a subcontractor, but retains the
36 provision of the bill requiring the processor to require any subcontractor to assist with
37 processing only in accordance with a written contract that requires the subcontractor to
38 meet the processor's obligations regarding the personal data under the processor's contract
39 with the controller.
40 9. It removes the provision of the bill requiring 3rd parties to provide specific notices
41 to consumers.

1 10. It removes the requirement that controllers conduct data protection assessments for
2 each algorithm used on personal data.

5 standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary matters regarding
6 the implementing and operation of the Act.
