for Measuring Gaps in Home and Community-based Services
Preamble. Whereas, continuing workforce challenges have contributed to a gap
between home and community-based services that are authorized and those that are
delivered under the MaineCare program and state-funded programs; and
Whereas, consistent measurement of this care gap is critical to understanding whether
the gap is expanding or contracting and whether policy interventions are needed; and
Whereas, the federal Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services have published Medicaid home and community-based
services gap measures that states will be required to submit to the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services; and
Whereas, the Maine Health Data Organization has expertise that uniquely qualifies it
to calculate valid and complex health care measures; now, therefore, be it
Sec. 1. Maine Health Data Organization to develop measurement plan.
Resolved: That the Maine Health Data Organization shall develop a plan for annual
measurement of the State's home and community-based services care gap, using claims and
care authorization data that currently exist. The plan must ensure that the measures meet
federal Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services data requirements and are therefore comparable to measures submitted by other
states. As used in this resolve, "care gap" means the difference between the home and
community-based services individuals are authorized to receive and the services they
actually receive under the following MaineCare provisions and state-funded programs: the
Department of Health and Human Services rule Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits Manual,

Chapter 5, Office of Aging and Disability Services Policy Manual, Sections 61, 63, 68 and
69 as well as any rules that are adopted to provide services under the lifespan program
pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 34-B, section 5003-B.
Sec. 2. Department of Health and Human Services to provide sample data.
Resolved: That the Department of Health and Human Services shall provide sample data

related to care gap measurement to the Maine Health Data Organization on request for use
in developing the measurement plan in section 1.
Sec. 3. Report. Resolved: That the Maine Health Data Organization shall submit
a report to the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services by January 15,
2026 outlining available data, data gaps and the estimated cost of creating and
implementing an annual measurement of the care gap that meets federal reporting
requirements pursuant to section 1. The report may include recommendations regarding
responsibilities for ongoing data collection, tracking and reporting.
