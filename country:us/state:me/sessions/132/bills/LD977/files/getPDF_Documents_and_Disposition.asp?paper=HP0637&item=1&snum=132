1 Preamble. Whereas, continuing workforce challenges have contributed to a gap
2 between home and community-based services that are authorized and those that are
3 delivered under the MaineCare program and state-funded programs; and
4 Whereas, consistent measurement of this care gap is critical to understanding whether
5 the gap is expanding or contracting and whether policy interventions are needed; and
6 Whereas, the federal Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for
7 Medicare and Medicaid Services have published Medicaid home and community-based
8 services gap measures that states will be required to submit to the Centers for Medicare and
9 Medicaid Services; and
10 Whereas, the Maine Health Data Organization has expertise that uniquely qualifies it
11 to calculate valid and complex health care measures; now, therefore, be it
12 Sec. 1. Maine Health Data Organization to develop measurement plan.
13 Resolved: That the Maine Health Data Organization shall develop a plan for annual
14 measurement of the State's home and community-based services care gap, using claims and
15 care authorization data that currently exist. The plan must ensure that the measures meet
16 federal Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
17 Services data requirements and are therefore comparable to measures submitted by other
18 states. As used in this resolve, "care gap" means the difference between the home and
19 community-based services individuals are authorized to receive and the services they
20 actually receive under the following MaineCare provisions and state-funded programs: the
21 Department of Health and Human Services rule Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits Manual,
22 Sections 12, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 26, 28, 29, 40, 65, 92 and 96; and 10-149 C.M.R.
23 Chapter 5, Office of Aging and Disability Services Policy Manual, Sections 61, 63, 68 and
24 69 as well as any rules that are adopted to provide services under the lifespan program
25 pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 34-B, section 5003-B.
26 Sec. 2. Department of Health and Human Services to provide sample data.
27 Resolved: That the Department of Health and Human Services shall provide sample data
28 related to care gap measurement to the Maine Health Data Organization on request for use
29 in developing the measurement plan in section 1.
30 Sec. 3. Report. Resolved: That the Maine Health Data Organization shall submit
31 a report to the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services by January 15,
32 2026 outlining available data, data gaps and the estimated cost of creating and
33 implementing an annual measurement of the care gap that meets federal reporting
34 requirements pursuant to section 1. The report may include recommendations regarding
35 responsibilities for ongoing data collection, tracking and reporting.
36 SUMMARY
3377 This resolve requires the Maine Health Data Organization to develop a plan for annual
3388 measurements of the gap between authorized care and the services actually provided for
3399 home and community-based services under the MaineCare program, state-funded programs
4400 and the forthcoming lifespan program using existing data. The Department of Health and
4411 Human Services is required to provide data to the Maine Health Data Organization upon
4422 request. The Maine Health Data Organization must submit a report to the Joint Standing
4433 Committee on Health and Human Services no later than January 15, 2026.
