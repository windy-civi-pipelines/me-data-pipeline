16 a ballot, except for the unique identifier printed on each ballot. Each box must meet the
17 requirements of this section. Once approved by the Secretary of State, each box becomes

19 Sec. 4. 21-A MRSA §809-B is enacted to read:
20 §809-B. Voting device to record votes by unique identifier
21 1. Record votes by unique identifier. A voting device used in the conduct of state
22 elections must be able to record the unique identifier assigned to each ballot and any votes
23 cast for any person, or on any question, on that ballot. It must record this information in a
24 way that prevents any association between the identity of the voter and the ballot.
25 2. Public list. As soon as practicable after an election return is prepared under section
26 711, the clerk shall make public on the municipality's publicly accessible website a list of
27 votes for each ballot cast using a voting device in that municipality, organized by unique
28 identifier. This subsection does not apply to paper ballots counted using other methods.
29 Nothing in this section authorizes public disclosure of an official ballot, which is not a
30 public record pursuant to section 22.
31 SUMMARY
3322 This bill requires each ballot prepared by the Secretary of State to contain a unique
3333 identifier, except for sample ballots. Voting devices used in the conduct of state elections
3344 must be able to record the unique identifier assigned to each ballot and any votes cast for
3355 any person, or any question, on that ballot. The clerk of a municipality is required to post
3366 on the municipality's publicly accessible website, as soon as practicable after the election
3377 return is prepared, a list of votes cast, organized by unique identifier. This provision does
3388 not apply to paper ballots counted using other methods.
