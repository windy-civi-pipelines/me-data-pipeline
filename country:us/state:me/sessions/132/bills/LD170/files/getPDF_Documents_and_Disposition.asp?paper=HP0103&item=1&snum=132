16 Sec. 2. Personal electronic device policy exemptions. Resolved: That a
17 personal electronic device policy developed pursuant to section 1 must include a provision
18 that exempts a student from the personal electronic device policy if a licensed physician
19 determines that the use of a personal electronic device is necessary for the health or well-
20 being of the student or if an individualized education plan requires the possession or use of
21 a personal electronic device by the student.
22 Sec. 3. Maine Education Policy Research Institute; support and evaluation.
23 Resolved: That the Maine Education Policy Research Institute shall support the
24 department in developing an application form for the pilot program under section 1 and
25 provide the department by October 1, 2025 a list of possible evidence-based technology
26 solutions and a pilot program evaluation plan that a school administrative unit participating
27 in the pilot program shall use to collect and report data. The pilot program evaluation plan
28 must include, but is not limited to, changes in school climate or student mental health,
29 behavioral incidences, overall academic performance and teacher, student, administrator
30 and other stakeholder perceptions on the effect of the personal electronic device policy
31 developed pursuant to section 1.
32 Sec. 4. Reports. Resolved: That the Maine Education Policy Research Institute
33 shall, within existing resources, evaluate the pilot program results based on the data
