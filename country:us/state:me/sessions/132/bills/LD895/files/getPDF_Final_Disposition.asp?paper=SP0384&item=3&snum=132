Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, this legislation establishes an immersive outdoor education program that
provides interdisciplinary and experiential education in an outdoor setting, and this
legislation creates equitable opportunities for students across this State to have outdoor
experiences; and
Whereas, many children in this State lack opportunities to enjoy and learn about the
outdoors because of home circumstances, lack of access or transportation or a deficiency
of suitable school or community-based programs; and
Whereas, the Outdoor School for All Maine Students Program will prepare children
in this State for future success, will build self-awareness and confidence and will be an
opportunity to instill the importance of the State's natural resources industries by
encouraging future generations of farmers, foresters, persons who fish commercially and
others working outdoors or as stewards of the State's natural resources; and
Whereas, the Outdoor School for All Maine Students Program will begin in school
year 2025-2026; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore,
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
