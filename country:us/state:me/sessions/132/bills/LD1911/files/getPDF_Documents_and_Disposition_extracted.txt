12 years have passed since the date of conviction, and the person who is the subject of the
13 criminal history record information has completed the person's sentence, including any
14 period of supervised release;
15 2. Other convictions in this State. Since the time at which the person who is the
16 subject of the criminal history record information fully satisfied each of the sentencing
17 alternatives imposed under Title 17-A, section 1502, subsection 2 for the person's most
18 recent eligible criminal conviction up until the time the bureau submits the criminal history
19 record information related to that eligible criminal conviction to the Administrative Office
20 of the Courts under section 2403, subsection 2, the person has not been convicted of a crime
21 in this State and has not had a criminal charge dismissed as a result of a deferred disposition
22 pursuant to Title 17-A, former chapter 54-F or Title 17-A, chapter 67, subchapter 4; and
23 3. Pending criminal charges. The person who is the subject of the criminal history
24 record information does not have any pending criminal charges in this State.
25 §2403. Automatic sealing of criminal history record information
26 Criminal history record information for an eligible criminal conviction must be sealed
27 in accordance with this section if the eligible criminal conviction and the conduct of the
28 person who is the subject of the criminal history record information satisfy the requirements
29 of section 2402.
30 1. Monthly examination of records. Beginning January 1, 2027, the Administrative
31 Office of the Courts shall examine electronic case records at least once per month and
32 compile a list of criminal history record information that meets the requirements of section
33 2402.
34 2. Sealing orders. The Administrative Office of the Courts shall forward the list
35 compiled under subsection 1 to the court with jurisdiction over the underlying criminal
36 proceedings. The courts within that judicial district shall promptly issue sealing orders
37 based on the received list.
38 3. Notice to bureau. Upon issuing a sealing order under subsection 2, the court shall
39 electronically transmit notice of the order to the bureau. Within 14 days of receipt, the
40 bureau shall update its records to reflect that the criminal history record information related

9 and other entities that are authorized to obtain the sealed criminal history record
10 information under section 2265 by not disclosing the existence of the eligible criminal
11 conviction without being subject to any sanctions under the laws of this State. Other than
12 when responding to criminal justice agencies or when under oath while being prosecuted
13 for a subsequent crime, a person whose eligible criminal conviction is the subject of a
14 sealing order does not violate Title 17-A, section 451, 452 or 453 by failing to disclose the
15 eligible criminal conviction.
16 §2405. Motion to seal criminal history record information
17 This chapter may not be construed to prevent a person from filing a written motion
18 seeking a court order to seal the person's criminal history record information relating to a
19 specific criminal conviction in accordance with section 2263.
20 SUMMARY
2211 This bill establishes a system for automatically sealing criminal history record
2222 information associated with criminal convictions for certain crimes, provided that certain
2233 conditions are met. Automatic sealing refers to the process established by the bill by which
2244 criminal history record information related to qualifying convictions must be sealed and
2255 the dissemination of that information limited consistent with the requirements of the Maine
2266 Revised Statutes, Title 15, section 2265, without the need to file a petition to seal the
2277 information. Under the bill, the Administrative Office of the Courts must routinely
2288 examine electronic case records and compile a list of criminal history record information
2299 that qualifies for automatic sealing under this legislation and provide that list to the
3300 appropriate courts to issue a sealing order.
31 The bill provides a list of criminal convictions for which automatic sealing may be
32 available. The underlying crimes include all Class E crimes except for sexual offenses; all
33 Class D crimes except for certain crimes, such as certain violent crimes or certain offenses
34 against a family member; certain Class D or Class E drug crimes committed prior to
35 January 30, 2017; and other specified drug crimes.
36 The bill provides that for an eligible criminal conviction to be automatically sealed, 5
37 years must have passed since the date of conviction for a Class D or Class E crime. For a
38 Class A, Class B or Class C crime, 10 years must have passed since the date of conviction
39 and the person who is the subject of the criminal history record information must have
40 completed the person's sentence, including any period of supervised release. The criminal
41 history record information is not eligible for sealing if the person who is the subject of the
42 criminal history record information has been convicted of any other crimes in the time
43 elapsed since the person satisfied the sentencing requirements of the eligible criminal
44 conviction.
