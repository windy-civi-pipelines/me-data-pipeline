30 service that are directly incurred by the governmental entity or seller in a sales
31 transaction or assessed by an authorized 3rd-party payment service provider for a credit

5 SUMMARY
66 Current law permits a governmental entity to impose and prohibits a seller in a sales
77 transaction from imposing a surcharge on a credit card or debit card transaction. This bill
88 permits a seller in a sales transaction to impose a surcharge on a credit card or debit card
99 transaction. It also repeals a chapter of law governing credit card practices involving
1100 providers of travel services, as the law prohibits providers of travel services from imposing
1111 a surcharge on credit card transactions.
