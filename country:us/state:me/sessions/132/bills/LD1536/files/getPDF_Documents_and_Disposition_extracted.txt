2 Sec. 1. 15 MRSA §1023, sub-§5, as amended by PL 2021, c. 397, §1, is further
3 amended to read:
4 5. Fees. A bail commissioner is entitled to receive a fee not to exceed $60 for the
5 charges pursuant to which the defendant is presently in custody, unless the defendant lacks
6 the present financial ability to pay the fee. A defendant presently in custody who is
7 qualified to be released upon personal recognizance or upon execution of an unsecured
8 appearance bond, whether or not accompanied by one or more conditions of bail that have
9 been set by a judicial officer, but who in fact lacks the present financial ability to pay a bail
10 commissioner fee, must nonetheless be released upon personal recognizance or upon
11 execution of an unsecured appearance bond. A bail commissioner may not refuse to
12 examine a person to determine the person's eligibility for bail, set bail, prepare the personal
13 recognizance or bond or take acknowledgement of the person in custody because the person
14 in custody lacks the present financial ability to pay a bail commissioner fee. The bail
15 commissioner shall submit such forms as the Judicial Department directs to verify the
16 amount of fees received under this subsection. The sheriff of the county in which the
17 defendant is detained may create a fund for the distribution by the sheriff or the sheriff's
18 designee for the payment in whole or in part of the $60 bail commissioner fee for those
19 defendants who do not have the financial ability to pay that fee.

26 under subparagraph (8) or (9); or

29 docket under Title 4, chapter 8, 8‑A or 8‑B, or any other specialty docket
30 established by the Judicial Department, or by agreement of the parties as part
31 of a deferred disposition under Title 17‑A, section 1902; or
32 (b) A search upon articulable suspicion for possession or use prohibited by a
33 condition imposed under subparagraph (8) or (9);

32 Sec. 6. 15 MRSA §1026, sub-§5, ¶A, as amended by PL 2021, c. 608, Pt. C, §1,
