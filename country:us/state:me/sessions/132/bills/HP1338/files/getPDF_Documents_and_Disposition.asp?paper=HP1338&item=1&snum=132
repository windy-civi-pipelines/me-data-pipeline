WHEREAS, during these riots, LGBTQ citizens, led by transgender women of color, rose
up and resisted police harassment that arose out of discriminatory criminal laws that have since
been declared unconstitutional; and
WHEREAS, in the decades since the Stonewall riots, Pride celebrations have taken place

WHEREAS, in 2014, Maine was the first state in the nation whose highest court ruled it
unlawful for a school district to prohibit a transgender student from accessing the bathroom

Maine Human Rights Act that expanded protections to include sexual orientation; and
WHEREAS, since 2018, Maine has added a nonbinary gender designation for state
identification cards and birth certificates, prohibited transgender exclusions in health insurance
plans, banned the harmful practice of conversion therapy and secured state-level benefits for
veterans who were discharged from the military due to their sexual orientation or gender
identity; and

WHEREAS, members of the LGBTQ community have served their neighbors and our
State as Legislators and local elected officials, leading on countless issues important to the
people of Maine; and
WHEREAS, despite years of progress, members of the LGBTQ community in the United
States and around the world still face discrimination, violence and proposed rollbacks in state
and federal protections, and bias-based crimes based on sexual orientation and gender identity
are on the rise; and
WHEREAS, here in Maine there is a commitment to protecting the civil rights of LGBTQ
Mainers and to treating all people fairly and equally and with dignity and respect; now,
therefore, be it
RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Thirty-second Legislature
now assembled in the First Special Session, on behalf of the people we represent, take this
opportunity to recognize June 2025 as Pride Month as we continue to work toward full equality
for our LGBTQ family, friends and neighbors.
