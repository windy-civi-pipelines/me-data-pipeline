3 SUBCHAPTER 7
4 MUNICIPAL REGULATION OF RESIDENTIAL DWELLING UNITS
5 §4459. Municipal opt-in
6 The provisions of this subchapter apply to a municipality if the municipality
7 incorporates this subchapter by reference in the adoption of an ordinance or bylaw; in the
8 amendment to or adoption of a charter provision; or in the adoption pursuant to a
9 referendum. Nothing in this subchapter limits the home rule authority of municipalities to
10 adopt ordinances, bylaws or charter provisions on the same subject matter as this
11 subchapter.
12 §4460. Rent increase limits
13 A municipality may by adoption of an ordinance or bylaw; by amendment to or
14 adoption of a charter provision; or by adoption pursuant to a referendum impose a limit on
15 the amount of an annual rent increase for a residential dwelling unit within the municipality.
16 A limit on an annual rent increase for a residential dwelling unit may not exceed the annual
17 change in the Consumer Price Index, as defined in Title 25, section 1611, subsection 1-A,

19 For purposes of this section, the rent amount in place 12 months prior to the date of
20 adoption of the ordinance or bylaw; the amendment to or adoption of the charter provision;
21 or adoption pursuant to a referendum is the base rent upon which an annual rent increase
22 limit is calculated. If the residential dwelling unit was vacant 12 months prior to the date
23 of adoption of the ordinance or bylaw; the amendment to or adoption of the charter
24 provision; or adoption pursuant to a referendum, the last rent amount charged is the base
25 rent. If there was no previous rent amount, or if no rent has been charged for at least the
26 previous 5 years since adoption of the ordinance or bylaw; the amendment to or adoption
27 of the charter provision; or adoption pursuant to a referendum, the rent amount the owner,
28 landlord or property manager of the residential dwelling unit first charged is the base rent.
29 §4460-A. Evictions based on just cause
30 A municipality may by adoption of an ordinance or bylaw; by amendment to or
31 adoption of a charter provision; or by adoption pursuant to a referendum require that an
32 eviction or refusal by the owner, landlord or property manager of a residential dwelling
33 unit to renew a lease be based on just cause. For purposes of this section, "just cause"
34 includes:

37 term or term of the tenancy;

14 housing authority as defined in section 4702, subsection 2, except that occupancy by a

19 sleeping accommodations are provided in single rooms or in a series of closely associated

26 exemption expires, if any.
27 §4460-C. Reports
28 Beginning January 15, 2026, and annually thereafter, a municipality adopting the
29 provisions of this subchapter pursuant to section 4459 shall provide a report to the Maine
30 State Housing Authority and the Maine Office of Community Affairs. The report must

39 deceptive act or practice under Title 5, chapter 10. Any person claiming a violation of this
40 subchapter may pursue remedies under Title 5, chapter 10, and the Attorney General is
