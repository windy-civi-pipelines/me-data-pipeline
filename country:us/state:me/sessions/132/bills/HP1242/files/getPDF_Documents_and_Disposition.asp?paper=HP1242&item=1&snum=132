JOINT RESOLUTION HONORING THE MEMORY OF POPE
FRANCIS
WHEREAS, the members of the 132nd Maine State Legislature were greatly saddened to
hear of the passing of Pope Francis on Monday, April 21, 2025; and
WHEREAS, born on December 17, 1936, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, as Jorge Mario
Bergoglio, Pope Francis entered the Society of Jesus at age 21 and was ordained as a Jesuit
priest in 1969. He was appointed auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires in 1992 by Saint John Paul
II, became archbishop of the Argentine capital in 1998 and was created cardinal in 2001; and
WHEREAS, Pope Francis ascended to the papacy on March 13, 2013, upon the retirement
of his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI, becoming the first pontiff from Latin America; and
WHEREAS, Pope Francis dedicated his entire life to the service of God and His Church
and teaching the values of the Gospel with fidelity, courage and universal love, especially for
the poorest and most marginalized; and
WHEREAS, during his almost 13-year pontificate, Pope Francis focused on mercy, care
for creation and attention to those on the "peripheries of both the Church and society"; and
WHEREAS, Pope Francis canonized 942 saints during his papacy; and
WHEREAS, Pope Francis published 4 encylicals, Dilexit Nos ("He Loved Us"), Fratelli
Tutti ("All Brothers"), Laudato Si ("Praise be to You") and Lumen Fidei ("The Light of Faith"),
as well as 7 apostolic exhortations and 75 motu proprio documents; and
WHEREAS, just hours before his death, Pope Francis reminded the faithful of the dignity
of all persons, but most especially the vulnerable, the marginalized and migrants, and
encouraged all of us "to hope anew and revive our trust in others, including those who are
different from ourselves, or who come from distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways
of life and ideas"; and
WHEREAS, Pope Francis led a holy life focused on humility, simplicity, poverty of spirit
and a radical devotion to Christ's call of charity to the least among us; and
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should remember the abundant life of this human being
and successor to Saint Peter; now, therefore, be it
RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Thirty-second Legislature
now assembled in the First Special Session, on behalf of the people we represent, take this
opportunity to honor the memory of Pope Francis, reflecting fondly upon his immense holiness
and his legacy of service to those most in need.
