30 SUMMARY
3311 This amendment clarifies that a pretrial statement may not be requested by a defendant
3322 charged with certain sex crimes, certain domestic violence crimes, a violation of certain
3333 protection orders or a violation of a condition of release when the victim is a family or
3344 household member or dating partner. The amendment removes from the bill a provision
3355 that provides a separate process for serving a subpoena to and taking the statement of the
3366 victim when the defendant is charged with a crime against another person and the victim is
3377 the defendant's family or household member. Finally, the amendment clarifies that the court
3388 is required to issue an order barring a potential witness from any future testimony if the
3399 witnesses are properly served and fail to appear, unless the interests of justice demand
4400 otherwise.
