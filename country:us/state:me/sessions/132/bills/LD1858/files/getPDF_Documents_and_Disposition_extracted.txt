10 farmer's cooperative, a local food hub, a local food processor or a food service distributor
11 in the State, to a maximum state contribution of $5,000 per school administrative unit in
12 fiscal year 2025-26 and subsequent years or $5,500 per school administrative unit if

14 local seafood training administered by the department under subsection 18. All seafood
15 purchased using the fund must be grown or harvested in the State, with the exception of
16 processed and value-added food products produced in the State, which must meet standards
17 set by the department. The department shall create standards for allowable processed and
18 value-added food products produced in the State and provide guidance to school

20 under this subsection and subsection 17. At the end of a fiscal year, the school
21 administrative unit may provide the department with receipts documenting purchases
22 pursuant to this subsection during that year. Reimbursement or partial reimbursement to
23 school administrative units may be made only up to the amount available in the fund.
24 Failure to reimburse does not constitute an obligation on behalf of the State to a school
25 administrative unit. The department shall apply for federal grant funding to provide state
26 contributions in excess of $5,000 per school administrative unit in fiscal year 2025-26 and
27 subsequent years pursuant to this subsection if applicable grant funding is available. The

35 16. Funds appropriated for this purpose do not lapse but must be carried forward to the
36 next fiscal year to be used for the same purpose.
37 Sec. 3. 20-A MRSA §6602, sub-§18 is enacted to read:

2 to provide training throughout the State without cost for local school food service
3 programs to encourage and expand the use of local seafood in school food service
4 programs. The training program must emphasize practical training for food preparers,
5 including creative and effective cooking skills using local fresh seafood and local
6 seafood procurement skills. The training program must also inform participants about
7 practical supply chain solutions, including local food hubs and cooperatives within and
8 across each region of the State;
9 B. Foster collaboration between school food service programs throughout the State;
10 C. Facilitate and encourage the use of local food hubs; and
