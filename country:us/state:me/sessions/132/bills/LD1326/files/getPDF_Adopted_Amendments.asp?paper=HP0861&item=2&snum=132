12 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and inserting the
13 following:
14 'Sec. 1. 22 MRSA §2650-A is enacted to read:
15 §2650-A. Drinking water standards, monitoring and treatment for perfluoroalkyl
16 and polyfluoroalkyl substances
17 1. Definitions. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the
18 following terms have the following meanings.
19 A. "Community water system" has the same meaning as in section 2660-B, subsection
20 2.
21 B. "Nontransient, noncommunity water system" has the same meaning as described in
22 section 2660-B, subsection 5, paragraph A.
23 C. "Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances" or "PFAS" has the same meaning
24 as in section 2660-AA, subsection 3, including a regulated PFAS contaminant under
25 subsection 2, that is detectable in drinking water using standard analytical methods
26 established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
27 2. Maximum contaminant levels for regulated PFAS contaminants. The
28 maximum contaminant levels for regulated PFAS contaminants allowed for a community
29 water system or nontransient, noncommunity water system must be at or below the
30 maximum contaminant levels contained in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Section
31 141.61(c)(2), as promulgated on April 26, 2024, and not as superseded by subsequent
32 versions of that federal rule.

44 This amendment replaces language in the bill with language providing that monitoring

66 exceedances must take place in accordance with the version of 40 Code of Federal
77 Regulations, Section 141, as promulgated on April 26, 2024. It also adds language requiring
88 that public notice of an exceedance must include information identifying each type of PFAS
99 detected in the drinking water, the levels of each type of PFAS detected and the total level
1100 of PFAS detected. It changes the definition of "regulated PFAS contaminants" to mean
1111 those contaminants regulated under 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 141.61(c)(2),
