11 impose a condition of preconviction bail that a defendant submit to random search with

13 illegal drugs.
14 5. Fees Bail commissioner fees. A bail commissioner is entitled to receive a fee not
15 to exceed $60 for the charges pursuant to which the defendant is presently in custody,
16 unless the defendant lacks the present financial ability to pay the fee. A defendant presently
17 in custody who is qualified to be released upon personal recognizance or upon execution
18 of an unsecured appearance bond, whether or not accompanied by one or more conditions
19 of bail that have been set by a judicial officer, but who in fact lacks the present financial
20 ability to pay a bail commissioner fee, must nonetheless be released upon personal
21 recognizance or upon execution of an unsecured appearance bond. A bail commissioner
22 may not refuse to examine a person to determine the person's eligibility for bail, set bail,
23 prepare the personal recognizance or bond or take acknowledgement of the person in
24 custody because the person in custody lacks the present financial ability to pay a bail
25 commissioner fee. The bail commissioner shall submit such forms as the Judicial
26 Department directs to verify the amount of fees received under this subsection. The sheriff
27 of the county in which the defendant is detained may create a fund for the distribution by
28 the sheriff or the sheriff's designee for the payment in whole or in part of the $60 bail
29 commissioner fee for those defendants who do not have the financial ability to pay that fee.
30 A bail commissioner fee under this subsection is not a financial condition of release for the
31 purposes of section 1026, subsection 3, paragraph B‑1.
32 6. Attorneys-at-law Bail commissioners; attorneys-at-law. No An attorney-at-law
33 who has acted as bail commissioner in any proceeding may not act as attorney for or on
34 behalf of any defendant for whom that attorney-at-law has taken bail in any such
35 proceeding, nor may any attorney-at-law who has acted as attorney for a defendant in any
36 offense act as bail commissioner in any proceeding arising out of the offense with which
37 the defendant is charged.
38 7. Mandatory training. As a condition of appointment and continued service, a bail
39 commissioner must successfully complete a bail training program, as prescribed and
40 scheduled by the Chief Judge of the District Court, not later than one year following
41 appointment. The Maine Criminal Justice Academy shall provide assistance to collaborate
42 with the Chief Judge of the District Court in establishing an appropriate training program
43 class for law enforcement officers regarding execution of bail commissioners bonds. The
44 program shall class must include instruction on the provisions of this chapter, the relevant
Page 3 - 132LR0527(01)

415 constitutional provisions on bail and any other matters pertinent to bail that the Chief Judge
426 of the District Court considers appropriate and necessary. The Maine Criminal Justice
437 Academy and the Chief Judge of the District Court may also establish a continuing
448 education program class for bail commissioners law enforcement officers.
5 8. Bail commissioners in indigent cases. The Chief Judge of the District Court may
6 adopt rules requiring a bail commissioner to appear and set bail regardless of whether the
7 defendant is indigent and unable to pay the bail commissioner's fee. The Chief Judge of the
8 District Court may also adopt rules governing the manner in which a bail commissioner is
9 paid in the event an indigent person is released on bail and is unable to pay the bail
10 commissioner's fee.
11 Sec. 5. 15 MRSA §1024, first ¶, as enacted by PL 1987, c. 758, §20, is amended
12 to read:
13 Clerks of the District Court and clerks of the Superior Court, during the hours when
14 the clerk's office is open for business and subject to the control of the District Court Judge
15 or Superior Court Justice, may, without fee, take the personal recognizance of any
16 defendant for appearance on a charge of a Class D or Class E crime. Nothing in this section
17 may be construed to prohibit the appointment of any clerk of the District Court or the
18 Superior Court as a bail commissioner, except that no fee may be charged by the clerk
19 while the clerk's office is open for business.
20 Sec. 6. 15 MRSA §1025, as amended by PL 2003, c. 414, Pt. B, §28 and affected
21 by Pt. D, §7 and c. 614, §9, is further amended to read:

24 may, without fee, take the personal recognizance of any defendant for appearance on a
25 charge of a Class D or Class E crime as required by Title 15, section 1092, paragraph 4. If
26 authorized, a law enforcement officer may, without fee, take the personal recognizance
27 with deposit in accordance with Title 12, section 10353, subsection 2, paragraph C; and
28 Title 12, section 9707. The law enforcement officer's authority under this section continues
29 as long as the arrestee remains in the officer's custody.
30 If a court, bail commissioner or bail officer issues an order that a defendant in custody
31 be released pending trial, whether or not accompanied by one or more conditions under
32 section 1026, subsection 3, a law enforcement officer may, without fee, prepare the bond
33 and take the acknowledgment of the defendant.
34 Sec. 7. 15 MRSA §1025-A, as amended by PL 2023, c. 508, §1, is further amended
35 to read:
36 §1025-A. County jail employees
37 If a court or, bail commissioner or bail officer issues an order that a defendant in
38 custody be released, pending trial, on personal recognizance or upon execution of an
39 unsecured appearance bond, whether or not accompanied by one or more conditions under
40 section 1026, subsection 3, an employee of the county jail having custody of the defendant,
41 if authorized to do so by the sheriff, may, without fee, prepare the personal recognizance
42 or bond and take the acknowledgment of the defendant.
