1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the State is committed to sourcing 100% of its electric supply from
4 renewable energy by 2040; and
5 Whereas, in 2019, the State enacted a net energy billing program under which eligible
6 facilities must meet specific completion criteria, including achieving commercial operation
7 dates by December 31, 2024; and
8 Whereas, the net energy billing program provides a good-cause exemption if an entity
9 experienced external delays outside of its control; and
10 Whereas, Ameresco Solar, LLC and Nordic Sun Energy, LLC independently built
11 distributed generation resources in Ellsworth and Presque Isle, respectively; and
12 Whereas, Ameresco Solar, LLC's 1.99-megawatt project missed the deadline set forth
13 in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3209-A, subsection 9 due to external
14 delays caused by Versant Power's lengthening procurement lead time for its
15 interconnection equipment after Ameresco began constructing the project; and
16 Whereas, Nordic Sun Energy, LLC's 3-megawatt project experienced external delays
17 in Versant Power's transmission impact study that prevented execution of its
18 interconnection agreement and the start of its initial impact study as required to satisfy the
19 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3209-A, subsection 7, paragraphs A to E; and
20 Whereas, both projects were constructed and mechanically complete in advance of
21 the December 31, 2024 deadline to achieve commercial operation and immediate operation
22 of the projects is necessary to achieving the State's goal of sourcing 100% of its electricity
23 from renewable sources by 2040; and
24 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
25 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
26 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
27 therefore,
28 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
29 Sec. 1. Eligible to participate. Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in the
30 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3209-A, subsections 7 and 9, or any prior
31 eligibility determination, the distributed generation resources located in Ellsworth at 889
32 Bucksport Road and at interconnection queue number 148 and in Presque Isle at 14 State
33 Road at interconnection queue number 214 are eligible to participate in the net energy
34 billing program under Title 35-A, sections 3209-A and 3209-B, beginning on the date that
35 each project commences commercial operation.
36 Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation
37 takes effect when approved.
38 SUMMARY
3399 This bill authorizes 2 distributed generation resources to participate in the State's net
4400 energy billing program, despite the projects' failure to meet certain participation criteria.
