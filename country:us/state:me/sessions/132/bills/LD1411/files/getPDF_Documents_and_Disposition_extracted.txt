1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 29-A MRSA §1251, sub-§1-A, as amended by PL 2001, c. 687, §14, is
3 further amended to read:
4 1-A. Residents required to obtain license. Within 30 days of becoming a resident
5 of this State, a person shall apply to obtain a license in accordance with section 1301.
6 Except as provided in section 510, subsection 1, a person who fails to comply with the
7 requirement of this subsection and operates a motor vehicle on a public way or parking
8 area commits: a traffic infraction. If the person has been a resident for at least 90 days the
9 penalty is a fine of not less than $150 and not more than $500.
10 A. A traffic infraction if the person has been a resident for less than 90 days; or
11 B. A Class E crime if the person has been a resident for at least 90 days.
12 Sec. 2. 29-A MRSA §1301, sub-§6, as repealed and replaced by PL 2005, c. 250,
13 §2, is amended to read:
14 6. Social security number. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the social
15 security number of any applicant for a license or nondriver identification card must be
16 recorded on the application, and the Secretary of State may not issue a license or nondriver
17 identification card to a person who does not possess and provide a valid social security
18 number. The Secretary of State shall collect, store and verify the social security number of
19 an applicant for a license or nondriver identification card and may use that number to
20 establish a permanent license number or nondriver identification number. This subsection
21 does not apply to a person who provides written proof to the Secretary of State that the
22 person is legally ineligible to receive a social security number.
23 SUMMARY
2244 This bill modifies the penalties applicable to a person who fails to obtain a license
2255 within 30 days of becoming a resident of this State. Under current law, a violation of this
2266 provision is a traffic infraction if the person has been a resident for less than 90 days and a
2277 Class E crime if the person has been a resident for more than 90 days. Under the bill, a
2288 person who violates this provision commits a traffic infraction and if the person has been a
2299 resident for at least 90 days the person may be fined a minimum of $150 up to a maximum
3300 fine of $500. The bill eliminates the Class E crime for violating this provision.
31 The bill also modifies the provision of law that requires a person to disclose the person's
32 social security number on the person's application for a driver's license or nondriver
33 identification card. In current law there is language specifying that the provision does not
34 apply if the applicant provides proof to the Secretary of State that the person is ineligible
35 to receive a social security number. The bill clarifies that the provision is not applicable to
36 any person who is ineligible to receive a social security number, whether or not the person
37 provides proof to the Secretary of State.
