1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 20-A MRSA §2412, sub-§6, ¶B, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 414, §5, is
3 amended to read:
4 B. All full-time teachers in a public charter school must either hold an appropriate
5 teaching certificate or become certified within 3 years of the date they are hired, except
6 for those with an advanced degree, professional certification or unique expertise or
7 experience in the curricular area in which they teach.
8 Sec. 2. 20-A MRSA §13019-H, sub-§3, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 235, §25 and
9 affected by §41, is repealed and the following enacted in its place:
10 3. Certificate term; renewal. An educational technician certificate is issued for a
11 5-year period and may be renewed in accordance with rules adopted by the state board.
12 Rules adopted by the state board must include, but are not limited to, the following
13 requirements related to renewing an educational technician certificate:
14 A. To renew a certificate, except as provided in paragraph B, an educational
15 technician, whether employed or unemployed, must complete at least 3 semester hours
16 of professional or academic study or the equivalent or in-service training designed to
17 improve the performance of the educational technician in the field; and
18 B. If at the time of a person's application for renewal the person's educational
19 technician certificate has expired and it has been more than 2 years since the person
20 was employed as an educational technician, the person is exempt from the requirements
21 of paragraph A.
22 SUMMARY
2233 This bill amends the provisions governing the qualifications necessary for a full-time
2244 teacher to be employed by a public charter school. The bill eliminates alternatives under
2255 current law that allow a teacher to be employed without an appropriate teaching certificate
2266 if the teacher becomes certified within 3 years from the teacher's date of hire or if the
2277 teacher holds an advanced degree, professional certification or unique expertise or
2288 experience in the relevant curricular area.
29 The bill also changes requirements applying to renewing an educational technician
30 certificate to exempt from the professional or academic study and in-service training
31 required for certificate renewal a person whose certificate has expired and who has not
32 been employed as an educational technician in more than 2 years at the time of the person's
33 application for renewal.
