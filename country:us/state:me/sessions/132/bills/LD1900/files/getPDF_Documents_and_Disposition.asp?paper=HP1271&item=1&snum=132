10 Professional and Financial Regulation and the Department of Inland Fisheries and

16 C. "Support order" or "order of support" means a judgment, decree or order, whether
17 temporary, final or subject to modification, issued by the Penobscot Nation Tribal
18 Court or the Maliseet Tribal Court for the support and maintenance of a child or a child
19 and the parent with whom the child is living that provides for monetary support, health
20 care, arrearages or reimbursement and may include related costs and fees, interest and
21 penalties, income withholding, attorney's fees and other relief.
22 2. Notice. The Penobscot Nation or the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians may serve
23 notice upon a support obligor who is not in compliance with an order of support that
24 informs the obligor of the Penobscot Nation's or the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians'
25 intention to submit the obligor's name to the appropriate board as a licensee who is not in
26 compliance with an order of support. The notice must inform the obligor that:
27 A. The obligor may request a court hearing in the Penobscot Nation Tribal Court or
28 the Maliseet Tribal Court to contest the issue of compliance;
29 B. A request for hearing must be made in writing and must be received by the
30 Penobscot Nation Tribal Court or the Maliseet Tribal Court within 20 days of service;
31 C. If the obligor requests a hearing within 20 days of service, the Penobscot Nation or
32 the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians will stay the action to certify the obligor to a
33 board for noncompliance with an order of support pending a hearing;
34 D. If the obligor does not request a hearing within 20 days of service and is not in
35 compliance with an order of support, the Penobscot Nation or the Houlton Band of
36 Maliseet Indians will certify the obligor to the appropriate board for noncompliance
37 with an order of support;
38 E. If the Penobscot Nation or the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians certifies the obligor
39 to a board for noncompliance with an order of support, the board must revoke the
40 obligor's license and refuse to issue or reissue a license until the obligor provides the
41 board with a written confirmation of compliance from the Penobscot Nation or the
42 Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians that states the obligor is in compliance with the
Page 1 - 132LR2031(01)

413 obligor's order of support. The notice must state that revocation by a board or a refusal
424 to reissue, renew or otherwise extend the license or certificate of authority is deemed a
435 final determination within the meaning of Title 5, section 10002; and
4 F. The obligor can comply with an order of support by:
5 (1) Paying current support;
6 (2) Paying all past-due support or, if unable to pay all past-due support and a
7 periodic payment for past-due support has not been ordered by the court, by making
8 periodic payments in accordance with a written payment agreement with the
9 Penobscot Nation or the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians; and
10 (3) Meeting the obligor's health insurance obligation, if applicable.
11 The notice must include the address and telephone number of the Penobscot Nation's or the
12 Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians' support enforcement office that issues the notice and a
13 statement of the need to obtain a written confirmation of compliance from that office as
14 provided in subsection 10. The Penobscot Nation or the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians
15 shall attach a copy of the obligor's order of support to the notice. Service of the notice must
16 be made in the manner provided for service of summons by the Maine Rules of Civil
17 Procedure, Rule 4. For purposes of this subsection, support enforcement action must be
18 deemed to be an action pursuant to Chapter XIII of the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure.
19 3. Written agreement to pay past-due support. An obligor who is presently unable
20 to pay all past-due support may come into compliance with the support order by executing
21 a written payment agreement with the Penobscot Nation or the Houlton Band of Maliseet
22 Indians and by complying with that agreement. A condition of a written payment
23 agreement must be that the obligor pay the current support when due. Before a written
24 payment agreement is executed, the obligor shall:
25 A. Disclose fully to the Penobscot Nation or the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians in
26 writing on a form prescribed by the Penobscot Nation or the Houlton Band of Maliseet
27 Indians the obligor's financial circumstances, including income from all sources, assets,
28 liabilities and work history for the past year; and
29 B. Provide documentation to the Penobscot Nation or the Houlton Band of Maliseet
30 Indians concerning the obligor's financial circumstances, including copies of the most
31 recent state and federal income tax returns, both personal and business, a copy of a
32 recent pay stub representative of current income and copies of other records that show
33 the obligor's income and the present value of assets held by the obligor.
34 After full financial disclosure under this subsection, the Penobscot Nation or the Houlton
35 Band of Maliseet Indians shall determine the obligor's ability to pay past-due support and
36 request the obligor to execute a written payment agreement consistent with the obligor's
37 ability to pay, not to exceed the limits on income withholding in section 2356.
38 4. Failure to comply with written agreement. Failure to comply with a written
39 payment agreement described in subsection 3 is grounds for license revocation unless the
40 obligor notifies the Penobscot Nation or the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians that the
41 obligor is unable to comply with the agreement and provides the Penobscot Nation or the
42 Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians with evidence of the obligor's current financial
43 circumstances to support the claim. The consequences of failing to comply with a written
44 payment agreement and the requirements to avoid license revocation, if the obligor cannot
Page 2 - 132LR2031(01)

415 comply with the agreement, must be stated in the agreement. If the obligor claims inability
426 to comply with a written payment agreement, the Penobscot Nation, upon motion to the
437 Penobscot Nation Tribal Court, or the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, upon motion to
448 the Maliseet Tribal Court, may request the tribal court to determine the obligor's ability to
459 pay past-due support. After notice and an opportunity for hearing, the tribal court may
560 make a finding of money due and render judgment in that amount.
7 5. Hearing. An obligor may request a hearing in the Penobscot Nation Tribal Court
8 or the Maliseet Tribal Court upon service of the notice described in subsection 2. The
9 request for hearing must be made in writing and must be received by the Penobscot Nation
10 Tribal Court or the Maliseet Tribal Court within 20 days of service. The issues that may
11 be determined at hearing are whether the obligor is required to pay support under an order
12 of support and whether the obligor is in compliance with an order of support.
13 6. Order. The Penobscot Nation Tribal Court or the Maliseet Tribal Court shall issue
14 an order after hearing without undue delay as to whether the obligor is in compliance with
15 the obligor's order of support. The order must be based on the hearing record. The
16 Penobscot Nation Tribal Court or the Maliseet Tribal Court shall send an attested copy of
17 the order to the obligor by regular mail to the obligor's most recent address of record.
18 7. Stay. If an obligor timely requests a hearing to contest the issue of compliance, the
19 Penobscot Nation or the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians may not certify the name of the
20 obligor to a board for noncompliance with an order of support until the Penobscot Nation
21 Tribal Court or the Maliseet Tribal Court issues an order after hearing that finds the obligor
22 is not in compliance with an order of support.
23 8. Certification of noncompliance. The Penobscot Nation or the Houlton Band of
24 Maliseet Indians may certify in writing to the appropriate board that a support obligor is
25 not in compliance with an order of support if:
26 A. The obligor does not timely request a hearing upon service of a notice issued under
27 subsection 2 and is not in compliance with an order of support 21 days after service of
28 the notice;
29 B. The Penobscot Nation Tribal Court or the Maliseet Tribal Court issues a
30 nonappealable, final judgment that the obligor is not in compliance with an order of
31 support;
32 C. The obligor abandons a timely request for a hearing on the Penobscot Nation's or
33 the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians' notice of noncompliance and is not in
34 compliance with the support order; or
35 D. The obligor fails to comply with a written payment agreement described in
36 subsection 3, does not notify the Penobscot Nation or the Houlton Band of Maliseet
37 Indians that the obligor is unable to comply with the agreement and does not provide
38 the Penobscot Nation or the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians with evidence of the
39 obligor's current financial circumstances.
40 The Penobscot Nation or the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians shall send by regular mail
41 a copy of a certification of noncompliance filed with a board to the obligor at the obligor's
42 most recent address of record. The certification of noncompliance is prima facie evidence
43 that the obligor is required to pay support under an order of support and is not in compliance
44 with that order of support.
Page 3 - 132LR2031(01)

1 9. Notice from board. A board shall notify an obligor certified by the Penobscot
2 Nation or the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians under subsection 8, without undue delay,
3 that the obligor's application for the issuance or renewal of a license may not be granted or
4 that the obligor's license has been revoked because the obligor's name has been certified by
5 the Penobscot Nation or the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians as a support obligor who is
6 not in compliance with an order of support. The notice constitutes final agency action for
7 the purposes of judicial review under Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 7. Notwithstanding
8 Title 5, section 11006, the Superior Court may supplement the record, including records of
9 any proceedings before the Penobscot Nation or the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians that
10 resulted in the certification under subsection 8.
11 10. Written confirmation of compliance. When an obligor who is served notice
12 under subsection 2 subsequently complies with the official order of support, the Penobscot
13 Nation or the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians shall provide the obligor with written
14 confirmation that the obligor is in compliance with the order of support.
15 11. Agreements. The Penobscot Nation or the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and
16 the various boards may enter into agreements that are necessary to carry out the
17 requirements of this section.
18 12. Motion to modify order of support; stay. This section does not prohibit a support
19 obligor from filing a motion to modify support with the Penobscot Nation Tribal Court or
20 the Maliseet Tribal Court.
21 13. Reporting. As soon as economically feasible and at least annually, all boards
22 subject to this section and the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation,
23 Division of Administrative Services shall provide to the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton
24 Band of Maliseet Indians specified information in machine-readable or electronic form,
25 according to standards established by the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of
26 Maliseet Indians, about applicants for licensure and all current licensees. The Department
27 of Professional and Financial Regulation, Office of Securities shall provide the specified
28 information for only those current licensees who are residents of this State. The
29 information to be provided must include all of the following information about the licensee:
30 A. Name;
31 B. Address of record;
32 C. Federal employer identification number or social security number;
33 D. Type of license;
34 E. Effective date of license or renewal;
35 F. Expiration date of license; and
36 G. Active or inactive status.
37 14. Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife report. The Commissioner of
38 Inland Fisheries and Wildlife shall provide annually to the Penobscot Nation and the
39 Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians in machine-readable or electronic form watercraft,
40 snowmobile and all-terrain vehicle registration information concerning obligors who are
41 residents of this State. The information to be provided must include all of the following
42 information about the registrant:
Page 4 - 132LR2031(01)

5 all-terrain vehicle registered under Title 12, section 13155;
6 D. Type of registration;
7 E. Effective date of registration or registration renewal; and
8 F. Expiration of registration.
9 15. Subsequent reissuance, renewal or other extension of license or certificate. A
10 board may reissue, renew or otherwise extend the license or certificate of authority of the
11 obligor in accordance with the board's rules after the board receives a copy of the written
12 confirmation of compliance specified in subsection 10. A board may waive any applicable
13 requirement for reissuance, renewal or other extension if it determines that the imposition
14 of that requirement places an undue burden on the obligor and that waiver of the
15 requirement is consistent with the public interest.
16 Sec. 2. 35-A MRSA §3916, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 189, §1, is amended to read:
