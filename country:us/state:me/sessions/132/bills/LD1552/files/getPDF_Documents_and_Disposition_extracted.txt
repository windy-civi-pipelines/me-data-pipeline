3 §6030-K. Prohibition on using algorithmic device or artificial intelligence in setting

13 amount of rent that a landlord may consider charging a tenant. For purposes of this section
14 "artificial intelligence" means an engineered or machine-based system that varies in its
15 level of autonomy and that can, for explicit or implicit objectives, infer from the input it
16 receives how to generate outputs that can influence physical or virtual environments.

2233 tenant for the occupancy of a residential property, including determining any change in the
