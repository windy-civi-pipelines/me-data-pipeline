15 SUMMARY
1166 This amendment replaces the bill and removes the emergency preamble and emergency
1177 clause. It requires the Public Utilities Commission to establish a process by rule by which
1188 a whistleblower may provide information to the commission regarding the conduct of a
1199 public utility in the State. If the commission determines that the whistleblower's
2200 information was material to a commission investigation leading to the imposition of certain
2211 covered sanctions, the commission may award the whistleblower a percentage of the
2222 covered sanction amount. The amendment establishes criteria for the determination of the
2233 amount of the award that a whistleblower may receive and limitations on the types of
2244 individuals who may receive an award. It also allows an employee making an
2255 informational report to be protected from discharge, threats or discrimination against the
2266 employee regarding the employee's compensation, terms, conditions, location or privileges
2277 of employment without first bringing the subject matter of the informational report in
2288 writing to the attention of a person having supervisory authority with the employer.
