1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, public utilities are uniquely granted a monopoly, contrary to free-market
4 principles, and instead voluntarily submit to regulation as an alternative to the discipline of
5 competition; and
6 Whereas, regulation depends on the ability of regulators to detect and deter
7 imprudence, which can increase utility profits and rates and reduce service quality; and
8 Whereas, utility regulators and the public have faced an increasingly complex
9 challenge since utility holding companies were deregulated in 2005 after being regulated
10 nationally for 70 years and since utility restructuring began at about the same time; and
11 Whereas, those most aware of and able to report imprudence are courageous and
12 ethical employees and contractors of public utilities, acting in the public interest; and
13 Whereas, utility whistleblower activity to date has not occurred in this State,
14 suggesting that the State's utilities are performing flawlessly or that whistleblowers are too
15 afraid to come forward; and
16 Whereas, the federal Securities and Exchange Commission provides protection and
17 incentives to shareholders of publicly traded companies and requires financial disclosures,
18 but 2 utilities in this State have recently been exempted from these Securities and Exchange
19 Commission whistleblower and transparency requirements; and
20 Whereas, these Securities and Exchange Commission protections and incentives have
21 resulted in robust protections for shareholders, as well as compensation for whistleblowers
22 of between 10% and 30% of resulting savings, adding up to hundreds of millions of dollars
23 awarded to multiple courageous Americans in the past 3 years alone; and
24 Whereas, all utility customers in this State deserve protections similar to the
25 shareholders of United States corporations and deserve that these protections be established
26 as soon as possible; and
27 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
28 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
29 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
30 therefore,
31 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
32 Sec. 1. 35-A MRSA §1316, as repealed and replaced by PL 2023, c. 405, Pt. A,

37 electricity provider or because the employee brings the subject matter of the testimony or

20 reasonable steps to protect the anonymity of the whistleblower.
21 14. Investigation. The commission or its designee may investigate a report made
22 under this section. Materials related to an investigation that in the judgment of the
23 commission may compromise the identity of a whistleblower must be treated as
24 confidential and may be shared only with the Office of the Public Advocate and a
25 contracted investigator.
26 15. Limitation. An anonymous report under subsection 13 may not be relied upon as

29 awarded financial compensation totaling between 10% and 30% of the administrative
30 penalty or savings to ratepayers. In establishing the amount of the award, the commission
