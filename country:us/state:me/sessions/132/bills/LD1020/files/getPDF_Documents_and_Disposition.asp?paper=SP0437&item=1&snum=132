2211 property owner's heirs, assigns or successors. If the previous property owner or the heirs,
2222 assigns or successors of the previous property owner do not want the land, the bill requires
2233 the Maine Turnpike Authority to transfer the land at no cost to the municipality in which
2244 the property is located. The bill stipulates the municipality must donate the land to a local
2255 land trust if the municipality does not want the land. If the local land trust does not want
2266 the land, the municipality may offer the land for sale at a public auction.
