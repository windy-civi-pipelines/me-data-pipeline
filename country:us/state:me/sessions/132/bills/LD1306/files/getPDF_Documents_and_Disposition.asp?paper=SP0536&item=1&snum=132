19 SUMMARY
2200 This bill amends the law governing disposable food service containers in the following
2211 ways.
22 1. It repeals the provision that is currently set to take effect on July 1, 2025 that defines
23 "disposable food service container" to include service ware used to contain, transport or
24 otherwise package raw, uncooked or butchered meat, poultry, fish, seafood or eggs. It
25 retains the provision that is currently set to repeal on July 1, 2025, which does not include
26 service ware used to contain, transport or otherwise package raw, uncooked or butchered
27 meat, poultry, fish, seafood or eggs.
28 2. Current law repeals, effective July 1, 2025, the current exemption for a covered
29 establishment to sell at retail food or beverages in or on a polystyrene foam disposable food
30 service container that the covered establishment purchases prepackaged at wholesale. The
31 bill removes that July 1, 2025 repeal.
