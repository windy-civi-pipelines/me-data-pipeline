assessing services; when any a municipal assessing unit or primary assessing area employs
a full-time, professional assessor, this assessor must be certified by the bureau as a
professionally trained assessor having the basic knowledge required to perform the

amended to read:
1. Generally. The bureau shall furnish provide to the assessor of each municipality a

provide to its inhabitants reasonable notice of the availability of application forms. An
individual claiming an exemption under this subchapter for the first time shall file the
application form with the assessor or the assessor's representative. The application must
be filed on or before April 1st of the year on which the taxes are based.
Sec. A-3. 36 MRSA §6250, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2021, c. 483, Pt. AA, §3,

exclusive of the common elements, if any. "Homestead" includes the taxpayer-occupied
principal dwelling and up to 10 contiguous acres upon which it is located that is held in a

Sec. A-4. 36 MRSA §6254, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2021, c. 483, Pt. AA, §11,
is further amended to read:
1. Lien. The lien provided in section 552 must continue for purposes of protecting the
State's deferred tax interest in tax deferred tax-deferred property. When it is determined
that one of the events set out in section 6259 has occurred and that a property is no longer
eligible for property tax deferral under this chapter, the State Tax Assessor shall send notice
by certified mail to the taxpayer, or the taxpayer's heirs or devisees, listing the total amount
of deferred property taxes, including accrued interest and costs of all the years and
demanding payment on or before April 30th of the year following the tax year in which the
circumstances causing withdrawal from the provisions of this chapter occur the due date
established by section 6260.
When the circumstances listed in section 6259, subsection 4 occur, the amount of deferred
taxes is due and payable 5 days before the date of removal of the property from the State.
If the deferred tax liability of a property has not been satisfied by the April 30th demand
due date established by section 6260, the State Tax Assessor shall, within 30 days, record
in the registry of deeds in the county where the real estate is located a tax lien certificate
signed by the State Tax Assessor or bearing the assessor's facsimile signature, setting forth
the total amount of deferred tax liability, a description of the real estate on which the tax
was deferred and an allegation that a tax lien is claimed on the real estate to secure payment
of the tax, that a demand for payment of the tax has been made in accordance with this
section and that the tax remains unpaid.
At the time of the recording of the tax lien certificate in the registry of deeds, the State Tax
Assessor shall send by certified mail, return receipt requested, to each record holder of a
mortgage on the real estate, to the holder's last known address, a true copy of the tax lien
certificate. The cost to be paid by the taxpayer, or the taxpayer's heirs or devisees, is the
sum of the fees for recording and discharging of the lien as established by Title 33, section
751, plus $13. Upon redemption, the State Tax Assessor shall prepare and record a
discharge of the tax lien mortgage. The lien described in section 552 is the basis of this tax
lien mortgage procedure.
The filing of the tax lien certificate, provided for in this section, in the registry of deeds
creates a mortgage on the real estate to the State and has priority over all other mortgages,
liens, attachments and encumbrances of any nature and gives to the State all rights usually
instant to a mortgage, except that the mortgagee does not have any right of possession of
the real estate until the right of redemption expires.
Payments accepted during the redemption period may not interrupt or extend the
redemption period or in any way affect the foreclosure procedures.

passengers that is engaged in transporting within the State a bona fide payload of
travelers on an interstate or foreign cruise that originates outside the State and
terminates outside the State and the transportation is provided pursuant to a
contract between the interstate or foreign cruise provider and the person providing

Page 3 - 132LR0154(04)
