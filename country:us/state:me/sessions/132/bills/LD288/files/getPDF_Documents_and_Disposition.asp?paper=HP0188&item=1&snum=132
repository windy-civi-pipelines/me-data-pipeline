34 is further amended to read:
35 1. Lien. The lien provided in section 552 must continue for purposes of protecting the
36 State's deferred tax interest in tax deferred tax-deferred property. When it is determined
37 that one of the events set out in section 6259 has occurred and that a property is no longer
38 eligible for property tax deferral under this chapter, the State Tax Assessor shall send notice
39 by certified mail to the taxpayer, or the taxpayer's heirs or devisees, listing the total amount
40 of deferred property taxes, including accrued interest and costs of all the years and
41 demanding payment on or before April 30th of the year following the tax year in which the
42 circumstances causing withdrawal from the provisions of this chapter occur the due date

Page 1 - 132LR0154(01)

1 When the circumstances listed in section 6259, subsection 4 occur, the amount of deferred
2 taxes is due and payable 5 days before the date of removal of the property from the State.
3 If the deferred tax liability of a property has not been satisfied by the April 30th demand
4 due date established by section 6260, the State Tax Assessor shall, within 30 days, record
5 in the registry of deeds in the county where the real estate is located a tax lien certificate
6 signed by the State Tax Assessor or bearing the assessor's facsimile signature, setting forth
7 the total amount of deferred tax liability, a description of the real estate on which the tax
8 was deferred and an allegation that a tax lien is claimed on the real estate to secure payment
9 of the tax, that a demand for payment of the tax has been made in accordance with this
10 section and that the tax remains unpaid.
11 At the time of the recording of the tax lien certificate in the registry of deeds, the State Tax
12 Assessor shall send by certified mail, return receipt requested, to each record holder of a
13 mortgage on the real estate, to the holder's last known address, a true copy of the tax lien
14 certificate. The cost to be paid by the taxpayer, or the taxpayer's heirs or devisees, is the
15 sum of the fees for recording and discharging of the lien as established by Title 33, section
16 751, plus $13. Upon redemption, the State Tax Assessor shall prepare and record a
17 discharge of the tax lien mortgage. The lien described in section 552 is the basis of this tax
18 lien mortgage procedure.
19 The filing of the tax lien certificate, provided for in this section, in the registry of deeds
20 creates a mortgage on the real estate to the State and has priority over all other mortgages,
21 liens, attachments and encumbrances of any nature and gives to the State all rights usually
22 instant to a mortgage, except that the mortgagee does not have any right of possession of
23 the real estate until the right of redemption expires.

23 SUMMARY
2244 Part A:
25 1. Changes the certification requirements for full-time, professional property assessors
26 to require that they must be certified by Maine Revenue Services as having the basic
27 knowledge required to perform the assessing function instead of being certified as
28 professionally trained assessors;
29 2. Removes the requirement that Maine Revenue Services send municipalities printed
30 applications for the Maine Resident Homestead Property Tax Exemption;
31 3. Clarifies the definition of "homestead" in the laws governing homestead property

33 of the value of the common areas and tax lot included in a homestead in a multi-unit
34 building; and
35 4. Corrects a conflict in the payment due date for the homestead property tax deferral
36 program for senior citizens and persons with disabilities by changing the due date from
37 April 30th of the calendar year following the year in which the property exited the program
38 to within 12 months after the property exited the program to conform to changes made to
39 the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 36, section 6260, subsection 2 by Public Law 2023,

7 3. Clarifies the timing of the testing period for the sales tax exemption for leases for
8 certain instrumentalities of interstate or foreign commerce.

11 nonresident and part-year resident taxpayers applies before the proration of the credit for
12 those taxpayers;
13 2. Eliminates the expired high-technology investment income tax credit;
14 3. Eliminates the requirement that a separate return must be filed for the insurance
15 premiums tax on workers' compensation insurance;
16 4. Updates a calendar year reference in the section of law governing estimated income
17 tax payments to a fiscal year to address a provision that was missed when Public Law 2023,
18 chapter 360 updated the other calendar year references in that section;
19 5. Makes rulemaking regarding the easy enrollment health insurance program
20 discretionary; and
21 6. Eliminates the expired shipbuilding facility credit.

23 certain other provisions and makes other changes to conform with current drafting
24 standards.
