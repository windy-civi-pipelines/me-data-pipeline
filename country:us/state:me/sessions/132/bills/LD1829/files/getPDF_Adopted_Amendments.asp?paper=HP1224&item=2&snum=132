5 4. Subdivision. "Subdivision" means the division of a tract or parcel of land into 3 or
6 more lots within any 5-year period that begins on or after September 23, 1971. This
7 definition applies whether the division is accomplished by sale, lease, development,
8 buildings or otherwise. The term "subdivision" also includes the division of a new structure
9 or structures on a tract or parcel of land into 3 5 or more dwelling units within a 5-year
10 period, the construction or placement of 3 5 or more dwelling units on a single tract or
11 parcel of land and the division of an existing structure or structures previously used for
12 commercial or industrial use into 3 5 or more dwelling units within a 5-year period.
13 A. In determining whether a tract or parcel of land is divided into 3 or more lots, the
14 first dividing of the tract or parcel is considered to create the first 2 lots and the next
15 dividing of either of these first 2 lots, by whomever accomplished, is considered to
16 create a 3rd lot, unless:
17 (1) Both dividings are accomplished by a subdivider who has retained one of the
18 lots for the subdivider's own use as a single-family residence that has been the
19 subdivider's principal residence for a period of at least 5 years immediately
20 preceding the 2nd division; or
21 (2) The division of the tract or parcel is otherwise exempt under this subchapter.
22 B. The dividing of a tract or parcel of land and the lot or lots so made, which dividing
23 or lots when made are not subject to this subchapter, do not become subject to this
24 subchapter by the subsequent dividing of that tract or parcel of land or any portion of
25 that tract or parcel. The municipal reviewing authority shall consider the existence of
26 the previously created lot or lots in reviewing a proposed subdivision created by a
27 subsequent dividing.
28 C. A lot of 40 or more acres must be counted as a lot, except:
29 (2) When a municipality has, by ordinance, or the municipal reviewing authority
30 has, by regulation, elected not to count lots of 40 or more acres as lots for the
31 purposes of this subchapter when the parcel of land being divided is located
32 entirely outside any shoreland area as defined in Title 38, section 435 or a
33 municipality's shoreland zoning ordinance.
34 D-1. A division accomplished by devise does not create a lot or lots for the purposes
35 of this definition, unless the intent of the transferor is to avoid the objectives of this
36 subchapter or avoid other applicable municipal requirements, including, but not limited
37 to, road standards and safety.
38 D-2. A division accomplished by condemnation does not create a lot or lots for the
39 purposes of this definition, unless the intent of the transferor is to avoid the objectives
40 of this subchapter.
41 D-3. A division accomplished by order of court does not create a lot or lots for the
42 purposes of this definition, unless the intent of the transferor is to avoid the objectives
43 of this subchapter.

1 D-4. A division accomplished by gift to a person related to the donor of an interest in
2 property held by the donor for a continuous period of 5 years prior to the division by
3 gift does not create a lot or lots for the purposes of this definition, unless the intent of
4 the transferor is to avoid the objectives of this subchapter. If the real estate exempt
5 under this paragraph is transferred within 5 years to another person not related to the
6 donor of the exempt real estate as provided in this paragraph, then the previously
7 exempt division creates a lot or lots for the purposes of this subsection. "Person related
8 to the donor" means a spouse, parent, grandparent, brother, sister, child or grandchild
9 related by blood, marriage or adoption. A gift under this paragraph can not cannot be
10 given for consideration that is more than 1/2 the assessed value of the real estate.
11 D-5. A division accomplished by a gift to a municipality if that municipality accepts
12 the gift does not create a lot or lots for the purposes of this definition, unless the intent
13 of the transferor is to avoid the objectives of this subchapter.
14 D-6. A division accomplished by the transfer of any interest in land to the owners of
15 land abutting that land does not create a lot or lots for the purposes of this definition,
16 unless the intent of the transferor is to avoid the objectives of this subchapter. If the
17 real estate exempt under this paragraph is transferred within 5 years to another person
18 without all of the merged land, then the previously exempt division creates a lot or lots
19 for the purposes of this subsection.
20 E. The division of a tract or parcel of land into 3 or more lots and upon each of which
21 lots permanent dwelling structures legally existed before September 23, 1971 is not a
22 subdivision.
23 F. In determining the number of dwelling units in a structure, the provisions of this
24 subsection regarding the determination of the number of lots apply, including
25 exemptions from the definition of a subdivision of land.
26 H-2. This subchapter may not be construed to prevent a municipality from enacting an
27 ordinance under its home rule authority that otherwise regulates land use activities.
28 A municipality may not enact an ordinance that expands the definition of "subdivision"
29 except as provided in this subchapter. A municipality that has a definition of
30 "subdivision" that conflicts with the requirements of this subsection at the time this
31 paragraph takes effect shall comply with this subsection no later than January 1, 2021
32 July 1, 2027. Such a municipality must file its conflicting definition at the county
33 registry of deeds by June 30, 2020 for the definition to remain valid for the grace period
34 ending January 1, 2021. A filing required under this paragraph must be collected and
35 indexed in a separate book in the registry of deeds for the county in which the
36 municipality is located.
37 I. The grant of a bona fide security interest in an entire lot that has been exempted from
38 the definition of subdivision under paragraphs D‑1 to D‑6, or subsequent transfer of
39 that entire lot by the original holder of the security interest or that person's successor
40 in interest, does not create a lot for the purposes of this definition, unless the intent of
41 the transferor is to avoid the objectives of this subchapter. A mortgage, pledge or other
42 instrument of hypothecation against a dwelling unit or other smaller portion of real
43 property within a parcel that is otherwise defined by this section as a lot does not itself
44 constitute a subdivision for purposes of this section.

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 1224, L.D. 1829
1 J. Unless the intent of a transferor is to avoid the objectives of this subchapter, the
2 division of a tract or parcel of land accomplished by the transfer of any interest in the
3 land to a holder does not create a lot or lots for purposes of this definition if:
4 (1) The transferred interest, as expressed by conservation easement, binding
5 agreement, declaration of trust or otherwise, is to be permanently held for one or
6 more of the following conservation purposes:
7 (a) Retaining or protecting the natural, scenic or open space values of the land;
8 (b) Ensuring the availability of the land for agricultural, forest, recreational or
9 open space use;
10 (c) Protecting natural resources; or
11 (d) Maintaining or enhancing air quality or water quality; and
12 (2) The transferred interest is not subsequently further divided or transferred
13 except to another holder.
14 As used in this paragraph, "holder" has the same meaning as in Title 33, section 476,
15 subsection 2.
16 Sec. 21. 30-A MRSA §4402, sub-§6, as amended by PL 2019, c. 174, §2, is further
17 amended to read:
18 6. Division of new or existing structures. Beginning July 1, 2018 January 1, 2026,
19 a division of a new or existing structure into 3 or more dwelling units whether the division
20 is accomplished by sale, lease, development or otherwise in a municipality where the
21 project is subject to municipal site plan review.
22 A. For the purposes of this subsection, "municipal site plan review" means review
23 under a municipal ordinance that sets forth a process for determining whether a
24 development meets certain specified criteria, which must include criteria regarding
25 stormwater management, sewage disposal, water supply and vehicular access and
26 which may include criteria regarding other environmental effects, layout, scale,
27 appearance and safety.
28 B. The municipal reviewing authority in each municipality shall determine whether a
29 municipal site plan review ordinance adopted by the municipality meets the
30 requirements of paragraph A.
31 Sec. 22. Training of current members. Notwithstanding the Maine Revised
32 Statutes, Title 30-A, section 4364-C, subsection 4, a member of a municipal reviewing
33 authority or municipal body hearing zoning appeals holding office on the effective date of
34 this Act shall attend a training as described in Title 30-A, section 4364-C, subsection 4
35 within 180 days of the effective date or, if a training is not available within the 180-day
36 period, must attend the next available training.
37 Sec. 23. Application. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, except
38 for those sections of this Act that enact the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 25, section
39 2463-B, amend Title 30-A, section 4301, subsection 1-C and enact Title 30-A, section
40 4364-C, subsection 4, this Act applies to municipalities for which ordinances may be

8 1. It requires a municipality to allow a certain number of dwelling units per lot
9 depending on whether the lot is in a designated growth area or is served by public water
10 and sewer.
11 2. It establishes lot size and density allowances for residential dwelling units based on
12 whether the lot is in a designated growth area and served by public water and sewer, outside
13 a designated growth area and served by public water and sewer or within a designated
14 growth area but not served by public water and sewer.
15 3. It prevents a municipality from establishing dimensional requirements for multiple
16 residential units that are greater than the requirements for single-family dwelling units.
17 4. It exempts the creation of 4 or fewer dwelling units within a structure from planning
18 board review.
19 5. It prevents a municipality from requiring the owner of a lot where an accessory
20 dwelling unit is located to reside on the lot.
21 6. It clarifies that a municipality is prohibited from requiring additional review or
22 documentation about the adequacy of the water and wastewater service connection to a
23 housing structure beyond a written verification from a local plumbing inspector.
24 7. It requires a municipality to allow an affordable housing development to exceed
25 height restrictions by no less than one story or 14 feet, subject to review by a municipal fire
26 official or designee.
27 8. It amends the definition of a subdivision of a structure from a division into 3 or
28 more units to a division into 5 or more units within a 5-year period.
29 9. It requires individuals who serve on a municipal reviewing authority or a municipal
30 body that hears zoning appeals to attend a training on land use planning.
31 The amendment enacts a provision that fire suppression sprinklers are not required for

33 2 dwelling units.
34 The provisions of the amendment that require a municipality to amend or adopt an
35 ordinance to effectuate the changes proposed in the bill become applicable July 1, 2026, if
36 the ordinance may be enacted by the municipal officers without further action or approval
37 of the voters, and July 1, 2027 for all other municipalities.
