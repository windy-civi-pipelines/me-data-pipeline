buildings or otherwise. The term "subdivision" also includes the division of a new structure

period, the construction or placement of 3 5 or more dwelling units on a single tract or

Page 4 - 132LR0362(03)

A. In determining whether a tract or parcel of land is divided into 3 or more lots, the
first dividing of the tract or parcel is considered to create the first 2 lots and the next
dividing of either of these first 2 lots, by whomever accomplished, is considered to
create a 3rd lot, unless:
(1) Both dividings are accomplished by a subdivider who has retained one of the
lots for the subdivider's own use as a single-family residence that has been the
subdivider's principal residence for a period of at least 5 years immediately
preceding the 2nd division; or
(2) The division of the tract or parcel is otherwise exempt under this subchapter.
B. The dividing of a tract or parcel of land and the lot or lots so made, which dividing
or lots when made are not subject to this subchapter, do not become subject to this
subchapter by the subsequent dividing of that tract or parcel of land or any portion of
that tract or parcel. The municipal reviewing authority shall consider the existence of
the previously created lot or lots in reviewing a proposed subdivision created by a
subsequent dividing.
C. A lot of 40 or more acres must be counted as a lot, except:
(2) When a municipality has, by ordinance, or the municipal reviewing authority
has, by regulation, elected not to count lots of 40 or more acres as lots for the
purposes of this subchapter when the parcel of land being divided is located
entirely outside any shoreland area as defined in Title 38, section 435 or a
municipality's shoreland zoning ordinance.
D-1. A division accomplished by devise does not create a lot or lots for the purposes
of this definition, unless the intent of the transferor is to avoid the objectives of this
subchapter or avoid other applicable municipal requirements, including, but not limited
to, road standards and safety.
D-2. A division accomplished by condemnation does not create a lot or lots for the
purposes of this definition, unless the intent of the transferor is to avoid the objectives
of this subchapter.
D-3. A division accomplished by order of court does not create a lot or lots for the
purposes of this definition, unless the intent of the transferor is to avoid the objectives
of this subchapter.
D-4. A division accomplished by gift to a person related to the donor of an interest in
property held by the donor for a continuous period of 5 years prior to the division by
gift does not create a lot or lots for the purposes of this definition, unless the intent of
the transferor is to avoid the objectives of this subchapter. If the real estate exempt
under this paragraph is transferred within 5 years to another person not related to the
donor of the exempt real estate as provided in this paragraph, then the previously
exempt division creates a lot or lots for the purposes of this subsection. "Person related
to the donor" means a spouse, parent, grandparent, brother, sister, child or grandchild

the gift does not create a lot or lots for the purposes of this definition, unless the intent
of the transferor is to avoid the objectives of this subchapter.
Page 5 - 132LR0362(03)

D-6. A division accomplished by the transfer of any interest in land to the owners of
land abutting that land does not create a lot or lots for the purposes of this definition,
unless the intent of the transferor is to avoid the objectives of this subchapter. If the
real estate exempt under this paragraph is transferred within 5 years to another person
without all of the merged land, then the previously exempt division creates a lot or lots
for the purposes of this subsection.
E. The division of a tract or parcel of land into 3 or more lots and upon each of which
lots permanent dwelling structures legally existed before September 23, 1971 is not a
subdivision.
F. In determining the number of dwelling units in a structure, the provisions of this
subsection regarding the determination of the number of lots apply, including
exemptions from the definition of a subdivision of land.
H-2. This subchapter may not be construed to prevent a municipality from enacting an
ordinance under its home rule authority that otherwise regulates land use activities.
A municipality may not enact an ordinance that expands the definition of "subdivision"
except as provided in this subchapter. A municipality that has a definition of
"subdivision" that conflicts with the requirements of this subsection at the time this
paragraph takes effect shall comply with this subsection no later than January 1, 2021
July 1, 2027. Such a municipality must file its conflicting definition at the county
registry of deeds by June 30, 2020 for the definition to remain valid for the grace period
ending January 1, 2021. A filing required under this paragraph must be collected and
indexed in a separate book in the registry of deeds for the county in which the
municipality is located.
I. The grant of a bona fide security interest in an entire lot that has been exempted from
the definition of subdivision under paragraphs D‑1 to D‑6, or subsequent transfer of
that entire lot by the original holder of the security interest or that person's successor
in interest, does not create a lot for the purposes of this definition, unless the intent of
the transferor is to avoid the objectives of this subchapter. A mortgage, pledge or other
instrument of hypothecation against a dwelling unit or other smaller portion of real
property within a parcel that is otherwise defined by this section as a lot does not itself
constitute a subdivision for purposes of this section.

division of a tract or parcel of land accomplished by the transfer of any interest in the
land to a holder does not create a lot or lots for purposes of this definition if:

agreement, declaration of trust or otherwise, is to be permanently held for one or
more of the following conservation purposes:
(a) Retaining or protecting the natural, scenic or open space values of the land;
(b) Ensuring the availability of the land for agricultural, forest, recreational or
open space use;
(c) Protecting natural resources; or
(d) Maintaining or enhancing air quality or water quality; and
Page 6 - 132LR0362(03)

(2) The transferred interest is not subsequently further divided or transferred
except to another holder.
As used in this paragraph, "holder" has the same meaning as in Title 33, section 476,
subsection 2.
