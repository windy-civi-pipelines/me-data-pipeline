1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 4 MRSA ยง18-C is enacted to read:
3 ยง18-C. Housing Development Resolution Board
4 1. Board established. There is established within the Administrative Office of the
5 Courts the Housing Development Resolution Board, referred to in this section as "the
6 board," to hear an appeal of a final decision by a municipal reviewing authority affecting
7 housing development in the municipality. For the purposes of this section, "municipal
8 reviewing authority" means a municipal board of appeals established pursuant to section
9 2691, planning board, site plan board, design review board, historic preservation review
10 board or any other review board created by municipal charter or ordinance.
11 2. Membership; appointment. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court, or
12 the justice's designee, shall appoint 3 members to the board with experience and knowledge
13 of land use law or housing development. One member must be an attorney licensed to
14 practice law in the State and one member must be a professional engineer or land surveyor.
15 3. Term; chairs; compensation; vacancy. Board members serve 5-year terms or
16 until a successor is appointed, whichever is later. The initial members of the board serve
17 staggered terms of 3, 4 and 5 years. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court, or
18 the justice's designee, shall designate one member as chair to serve in that capacity for the
19 duration of the member's term. The Chief Justice, or the justice's designee, shall establish
20 compensation for board members and for the payment of expenses. Any vacancy on the
21 board must be filled for the unexpired term of the vacant seat.
22 4. Conflicts of interest. Board members shall avoid actual and perceived conflicts of
23 interest with their duties as a board member. A board member may not represent a party,
24 testify as an expert witness or render any professional service for any party or interest
25 before the board, and any member having an interest in a matter before the board is
26 disqualified to act on that appeal.
27 5. Removal. A board member may be removed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme
28 Judicial Court, or the justice's designee, for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in
29 performance of the member's duties.
30 6. Duties. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the board has the
31 power and authority to and shall hear and affirm, reverse or modify, in whole or in part,
32 appeals of a final decision of municipal reviewing authority under subsection 1 regarding
33 questions of housing and housing development. The powers and duties under this
34 subsection include, but are not limited to, appeals concerning:
35 A. Decisions on subdivisions or site plans;
36 B. Decisions on variances, special exceptions, administrative appeals and ordinance
37 administration;
38 C. The use of innovative land use controls;
39 D. Growth management controls and interim growth management controls;
40 E. Decisions of historic district commissions, heritage commissions and conservation
41 commissions;
Page 1 - 132LR0362(01)
1 F. Decisions on other municipal permits and fees applicable to housing and housing
2 developments; and
3 G. Decisions on mixed-use combinations of residential and nonresidential uses. Such
4 different uses may occur on separate properties as long as the properties are all part of
5 a common scheme of development.
6 7. Timing of appeals. If a municipal reviewing authority issues a final decision
7 denying an application for a housing or housing development project, the appeal must be
8 filed within 14 business days of the decision. If a municipal reviewing authority issues a
9 final decision approving an application for a housing or housing development project, the
10 appeal must be filed within 14 business days of the decision, except that, for a housing or
11 housing development project that requires more than one application to be reviewed and a
12 final decision issued by one or more municipal reviewing authorities, an appeal of a
13 decision may not be filed until a decision has been issued for all applications for the project.
14 8. Notice. At the same time an appeal is filed with the board, the appellant shall notify
15 the municipal reviewing authority of the appeal.
16 A. The municipal reviewing authority shall within 14 business days of receipt of the
17 notice of appeal submit to the board a certified record of its proceedings on the matter
18 subject to the appeal.
19 B. The board shall hold a hearing on the merits within 60 days of its receipt of a notice
20 of appeal.
21 C. The board shall issue a written decision on an appeal within 30 days after
22 conducting a hearing on the merits.
23 9. Parties to the appeal. After local remedies have been exhausted, appeals may be
24 brought before the board by an applicant to the municipal reviewing authority, or by any
25 other aggrieved or injured party who demonstrates legal standing to appeal. The
26 municipality shall be a party to the action. If the applicant is not the party initiating the
27 action before the board, then the applicant is automatically an intervenor. The board shall
28 grant intervenor status to abutters and to any other aggrieved or injured party who
29 demonstrates legal standing to appeal.
30 10. Notice. The board shall serve written notice of the time, place and cause of any
31 hearing upon all parties at least 20 days prior to the hearing date.
32 11. Jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, in matters
33 within its authority, the board has concurrent jurisdiction with the Superior Court. An
34 election by any party to bring an action before the board waives any right to bring an action
35 in the Superior Court. At any time during an appeal to the board, if the board determines
36 that it does not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal, the appellant has 30 days to file an
37 appeal with the Superior Court.
38 12. Automatic stay; dismissal. An appeal to the board of a final decision of a
39 municipal reviewing authority that has previously been or is subsequently included in an
40 appeal in Superior Court by another party to the final decision of the municipal reviewing
41 authority, or by any other aggrieved or injured party who demonstrates legal standing to
42 appeal, must automatically be stayed by the Superior Court to provide the party with
43 standing the opportunity to intervene in the matter before the board. If intervenor status is
44 granted, the stay of the Superior Court action regarding those claims continues during the
Page 2 - 132LR0362(01)
415 pendency of the appeal to the board. After the board has decided the appeal, the Superior
426 Court shall dismiss the matter before it to the extent the matter has been resolved by the
437 board. Any claim included in an appeal to Superior Court that is not within the board's
448 authority is not subject to the automatic stay.
5 13. Subpoena power; administration of oaths. The board has the same authority to
6 issue subpoenas, administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses to proceedings
7 before it as exists for the Superior Court.
8 14. Perjury. Any testimony given by a person duly sworn in an action before the
9 board is subject to the penalties of perjury.
10 15. Hearing procedure. Appeals to the board must be consistent with appeals to a
11 Superior Court. Appeals must be on the written record of the municipal reviewing authority
12 certified by a notary public, and, except in such cases as justice may warrant, in the sole
13 discretion of the board, additional evidence may not be introduced. The rules of evidence
14 do not strictly apply. The board shall record the proceedings of any hearing before it and
15 shall make the recordings available to the public for inspection and viewing from the date
16 of the hearing to a date 15 working days after the board has made a final decision on the
17 appeal.
18 16. Standard of review. The board may not reverse or modify a final decision of a
19 municipal reviewing authority except for errors of law or if the board is persuaded by the
20 balance of probabilities, on the evidence before it, that the final decision of a municipal
21 reviewing authority is unreasonable.
22 17. Remedies. In exercising its authority under this section, the board has the power
23 to award all remedies available to the Superior Court in similar cases, including permission
24 to develop the proposed housing and to award costs and reasonable attorney's fees.
25 18. Filing and enforcement of decisions. The board shall file a certified copy of a
26 final decision in the Superior Court of the county in which the municipal reviewing
27 authority is located. The judgment may be enforced in the same manner as a final Superior
28 Court judgment.
29 19. No appeal right. A final decision of the board is not appealable to a Superior
30 Court or the Supreme Judicial Court.
31 20. Procedures and rules. The court may adopt administrative orders and court rules
32 to govern the practice, procedure and administration of the board.
33 Sec. 2. 30-A MRSA ยง4324, sub-ยง2, ยถC is enacted to read:
34 C. Planning committee members shall attend a training on land use planning offered
35 by a state agency or a statewide association representing municipalities within 180 days
36 of appointment or of the effective date of this paragraph, whichever is later. If a
37 training is not available within the 180-day period, a planning board member must
38 attend the next available training.

10 appeal must be filed within 14 business days of the decision, except that, for a housing or
