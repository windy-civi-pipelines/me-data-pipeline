22 governmental turnpike authorities with redundant and duplicative staffs, infrastructure and
23 services; and
24 Whereas, the Maine Turnpike Authority has suffered from waste, fraud and abuse of
25 its bonding and spending authority, the costs of which are borne by residents of this State
26 via toll collections by the Maine Turnpike Authority; and
27 Whereas, the tolls on the Maine Turnpike have been raised to pay for unnecessary
28 spending projects when other, higher priority projects elsewhere in the State have been
29 unfunded and Highway Fund revenues have fallen significantly; and

31 benefits of and to create a plan for the integration of the Maine Turnpike Authority within
32 the Department of Transportation; now, therefore, be it
