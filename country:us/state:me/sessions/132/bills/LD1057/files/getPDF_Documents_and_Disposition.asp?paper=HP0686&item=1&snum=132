3 Whereas, a dog may not be kept within the limits of the State unless the dog has been
4 licensed by its owner or keeper in accordance with the laws of this State; and
5 Whereas, the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 7, section 3923-G allows municipalities
6 to participate in an electronic dog licensing project developed and implemented by the
7 Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, and the department gave
8 municipalities a deadline, which has gone by, to implement a specific data management
9 platform; and
10 Whereas, the implementation of the data management platform has been fraught with
11 challenges; therefore, platform functionality must be ensured and municipalities must be
12 given ample time to make the transition to this new platform; and
13 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
14 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
15 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
16 therefore, be it
