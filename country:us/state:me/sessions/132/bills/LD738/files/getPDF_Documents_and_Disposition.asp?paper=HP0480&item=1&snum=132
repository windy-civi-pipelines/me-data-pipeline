1155 of the applicant to practice law before a court of general jurisdiction within that jurisdiction
1166 or legal study in compliance with the requirements of a law office study program in another

18 The bill requires that an applicant who is determined by the board of bar examiners to
19 be otherwise eligible through a law office study program to take the examination for
20 admission to the bar must pay a fee fixed by the Supreme Judicial Court before the applicant
21 is determined eligible to take the examination.

23 applicants to submit required reports and notices to the board to be eligible to take the
24 examination for admission to the bar through a law office study program. If the board fails
