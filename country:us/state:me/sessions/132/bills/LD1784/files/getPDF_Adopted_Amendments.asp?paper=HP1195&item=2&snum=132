19 SUMMARY
2200 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, adds language to the
2211 bill to clarify that a law enforcement agency may not disseminate intelligence and
2222 investigative record information that is confidential in accordance with the Intelligence and
2233 Investigative Record Information Act and allows a law enforcement agency to charge a
2244 reasonable fee for the costs of producing physical copies of policies or procedures to the
2255 person requesting copies in accordance with the Freedom of Access Act. The amendment
2266 also removes references to specific law enforcement agency policies that must be published
2277 or produced. It requires a law enforcement agency to either post its policies and procedures
2288 online or provide the policies and procedures in a printed paper copy format instead of
2299 requiring the law enforcement agency to do both. It removes the provision requiring a law
3300 enforcement agency to publish a revision of a policy or procedure within 60 days of the
3311 revision.
