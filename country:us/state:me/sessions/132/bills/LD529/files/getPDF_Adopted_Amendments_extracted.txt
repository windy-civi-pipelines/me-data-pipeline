14 the Town of Orland at the time the district was formed.
15 The district shall provide information in print or electronic format regarding the annual
16 budget and appropriation request to the Town of Orland prior to and at the town's annual
17 town meeting, which must include the total amounts proposed by the district for each cost

20 district.
21 The board shall prepare the warrant article for this purpose and shall deliver the article to
22 the municipal clerk of the Town of Orland no later than February 1st of each year. The
23 warrant article must be in substantially the following form:
24 "Do you favor the Town of Orland raising and appropriating from property
25 tax $ (insert amount) to pay the Town of Orland's municipal contribution
26 to the Alamoosook Lake Watershed Management District?"
27 3. Failure to approve municipal contribution. The Town of Orland's vote on the
28 warrant article determines its obligation to pay the municipal contribution for the budgeted

30 the amount not appropriated must be included in the assessment on the waterfront property
31 owners.
32 Sec. 5. Contributions; assessments. The annual budget for the district as
33 described in this Act must reflect all expected expenditures and additions to capital
34 reserves, net of any grants, donations, loans or other anticipated sources of funds. To the

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 348, L.D. 529
415 which must be determined by the board as described in section 4. If the Town of Orland

437 be included in the assessment on the waterfront property owners.
4 A. Each waterfront property owner shall pay an assessment proportionate to the
5 amount of shoreline frontage along Alamoosook Lake on that waterfront property
6 owner's lot or parcel. For the purposes of calculating this assessment, the shoreline
7 frontage is the amount used for the purposes of property tax assessment, up to a
8 maximum of 300 feet of shoreline frontage, and a lot or parcel with more than 300 feet
9 of shoreline frontage must be deemed to have only 300 feet of shoreline frontage.
10 B. The district shall mail an invoice for the assessment amount due to each waterfront
11 property owner on a schedule and with a specified payment due date as determined by
12 the board. Failure to pay the assessment amount by the specified payment due date
13 incurs interest as determined by the board in a manner consistent with the Maine
14 Revised Statutes, Title 36, section 505. The district may place a lien on the lot or parcel
15 of a waterfront property owner that fails to pay the assessment amount by the specified

20 operation of the district as may be directed by the board. If the Town of Orland fails to
21 appropriate funds for its municipal contribution in accordance with the requirements of this
22 Act for 2 consecutive years, it is considered to have withdrawn from the district, subject to
23 conditions and requirements reasonably necessary for the continued operation of the district
24 as may be directed by the board. The district may be dissolved upon the disposition of all
25 of its assets and settlement of any liabilities and by an affirmative vote on dissolution by a
26 majority of the trustees of the board.
27 Sec. 7. Authorized activities prior to referendum. Notwithstanding the
28 referendum requirement of section 8, the municipal officers of the Town of Orland shall
29 prepare an estimated budget for the district for its first year of operation and shall determine
30 the aggregate funds required for that year. The municipal officers shall determine the
31 required municipal contribution for the Town of Orland, which must represent 50% of those
32 aggregate funds required. The municipal contribution amount determined pursuant to this
33 section must be used for the purposes of the referendum required in section 8.
34 Sec. 8. Emergency clause; referendum; effective date. In view of the
35 emergency cited in the preamble, this Act takes effect when approved only for the purposes
36 of allowing the municipal officers of the Town of Orland to prepare an estimated budget
37 and determine the aggregate funds required and required municipal contribution pursuant
38 to section 7 and for permitting the Act's submission to the legal voters of the Town of
39 Orland at a referendum called for that purpose and held after June 1, 2025 but within 2
40 years after the effective date of this Act. The referendum must be called by the municipal

42 referendum must be called, advertised and conducted according to the law relating to
43 municipal elections. For the purpose of registration of voters, the registrar of voters must
44 be in session the regular workday preceding the referendum. The subject matter of this Act
45 must be reduced to a question in substantially the following form:

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 348, L.D. 529
1 "Do you favor the establishment of and the Town of Orland's participation
2 in the Alamoosook Lake Watershed Management District and the
3 appropriation of $ (insert amount) to provide the Town of Orland's share
4 of the estimated budget for the first year of operation of the Alamoosook
5 Lake Watershed Management District?"
6 The voters shall indicate by a cross or check mark placed against the word "Yes" or
7 "No" their opinion of the same.
8 The results must be declared by the municipal officers of the Town of Orland and due
9 certificate of the results filed by the clerk with the Secretary of State.
10 This Act takes effect for all other purposes immediately upon its approval by a majority
11 of the legal voters of the Town of Orland voting at the referendum. Failure to achieve the
12 necessary approval in any referendum does not prohibit subsequent referenda consistent
13 with this section as long as the referenda are held within 2 years after the effective date of
14 this Act.'
15 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section
16 number to read consecutively.
17 SUMMARY
1188 This amendment replaces the bill, which is a concept draft, and changes the title.
1199 Subject to approval by the voters of the Town of Orland at referendum, the amendment
2200 establishes the Alamoosook Lake Watershed Management District for the purposes of
2211 acquiring ownership of, owning, maintaining and operating the dam on Alamoosook Lake

2233 Watershed Management District are to be funded as follows: 50% of the costs by municipal
2244 contribution from the Town of Orland, if approved by its voters; and the remainder of the
2255 costs by assessments on the owners of waterfront property abutting Alamoosook Lake as
2266 determined based on the shoreline frontage of each waterfront property owner.

23 conditions and requirements reasonably necessary for the continued operation of the district
24 as may be directed by the board. The district may be dissolved upon the disposition of all
25 of its assets and settlement of any liabilities and by an affirmative vote on dissolution by a
26 majority of the trustees of the board.
27 Sec. 7. Authorized activities prior to referendum. Notwithstanding the
28 referendum requirement of section 8, the municipal officers of the Town of Orland shall
29 prepare an estimated budget for the district for its first year of operation and shall determine
30 the aggregate funds required for that year. The municipal officers shall determine the
31 required municipal contribution for the Town of Orland, which must represent 50% of those
32 aggregate funds required. The municipal contribution amount determined pursuant to this
33 section must be used for the purposes of the referendum required in section 8.
34 Sec. 8. Emergency clause; referendum; effective date. In view of the
35 emergency cited in the preamble, this Act takes effect when approved only for the purposes
36 of allowing the municipal officers of the Town of Orland to prepare an estimated budget
37 and determine the aggregate funds required and required municipal contribution pursuant
38 to section 7 and for permitting the Act's submission to the legal voters of the Town of
39 Orland at a referendum called for that purpose and held after June 1, 2025 but within 2

3 appropriation of $ (insert amount) to provide the Town of Orland's share
4 of the estimated budget for the first year of operation of the Alamoosook
5 Lake Watershed Management District?"

7 "No" their opinion of the same.
8 The results must be declared by the municipal officers of the Town of Orland and due
9 certificate of the results filed by the clerk with the Secretary of State.
10 This Act takes effect for all other purposes immediately upon its approval by a majority
11 of the legal voters of the Town of Orland voting at the referendum. Failure to achieve the
12 necessary approval in any referendum does not prohibit subsequent referenda consistent
13 with this section as long as the referenda are held within 2 years after the effective date of
14 this Act.'
15 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section
16 number to read consecutively.
