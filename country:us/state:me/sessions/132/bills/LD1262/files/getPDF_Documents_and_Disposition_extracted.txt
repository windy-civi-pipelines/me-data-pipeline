19 A. To support actions by persons seeking to petition or that have petitioned an agency
20 for adoption or modification of rules pursuant to section 8055, including persons

22 B. To support actions by persons seeking to petition or that have petitioned an agency

30 the intervention or participation is authorized by law or rule.
31 4. Distribution of funds. After administrative costs, including any salary expenses
32 due to the administrator and other staffing and administrative costs associated with the
33 administration of the fund, revenue credited to the fund must be distributed as follows.
34 A. Annually, the administrator shall assess the amount of revenue within the fund that
35 is available for distribution during the next calendar year for the purposes identified in
36 subsection 3 and shall establish a formula to determine the amount of that identified
37 revenue that will be made available to each agency and to the Attorney General for
38 distribution. The administrator shall notify each agency and the Attorney General
39 regarding the total funding amount that will be made available to the agency or the
40 Attorney General from the fund in the next calendar year.
Page 2 - 132LR0879(01)

6 regulation under law or rule;
7 (2) Whose interest or position, as determined by the administrator, is not otherwise

12 information and government transparency.
13 C. In collaboration with each agency and the Attorney General, the administrator shall
14 develop and implement measures to educate members of the public and organizations
15 regarding the availability of revenue from the fund to support the purposes identified
16 in subsection 3.
17 Sec. 5. Office of Attorney General; report. The Office of the Attorney General
18 shall consult with each state agency that issues licenses, permits or other approvals to
19 persons to engage in regulated activities relating to the environment, natural resources,
20 public health and safety and freedom of information and government transparency to
21 identify a mechanism for imposing an additional fee amount for the issuance of those
22 licenses, permits or approvals to support activities authorized under the Fund for
23 Administrative Oversight, established in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, section
24 11021, in a manner designed to satisfy the anticipated annual demand for distributions from
25 that fund for the agency. The fee amounts identified must be reasonable, must not
26 unreasonably impede the activities of the regulated entity and must be designed to reflect
27 the anticipated cost to the agency of oversight of the regulated activity and addressing any
28 potential violations by the regulated entity, including any costs of corrective action or
29 remediation undertaken by the agency. By January 1, 2026, the office shall submit a report
30 to the Joint Standing Committee on State and Local Government outlining its
31 recommendations for imposing such additional fee amounts, including necessary proposed
32 legislation. The recommendations and proposed legislation must be designed to provide for
33 assessment and collection of the additional fee amounts beginning July 1, 2026 and must
34 provide that of those fee amounts collected, 1/2 must be retained by the state agency
35 assessing the fee to support its oversight and enforcement activities and 1/2 must be
36 transferred to the Fund for Administrative Oversight to support activities under that fund.
37 After reviewing the report, the committee may report out legislation relating to the report
38 to the Second Regular Session of the 132nd Legislature.

2 or modification of rules;
3 2. Actions by persons seeking to petition or that have petitioned an agency or the
4 Attorney General to initiate a proceeding to enforce an existing law or rule; and
5 3. Actions by persons seeking to intervene or otherwise participate in an agency

7 In distributing funds to such persons, the fund administrator must give priority to
8 persons that are not commercial entities or entities that are otherwise subject to regulation
9 under law or rule; whose interest or position, as determined by the fund administrator, is
10 not otherwise adequately represented in the rulemaking, proceeding or licensing action;
11 and whose interest or position, as determined by the fund administrator, is primarily
12 focused on protecting or conserving the State's natural resources or environment, protecting
13 the public health or safety or ensuring freedom of access to public information and
14 government transparency.
15 The bill also directs the Office of the Attorney General to consult with each state
16 agency that issues licenses, permits or other approvals to persons to engage in regulated
17 activities relating to the environment, natural resources, public health and safety and
18 freedom of information and government transparency to identify a mechanism for imposing
19 an additional fee amount for the issuance of those licenses, permits or approvals to support
20 activities under the Fund for Administrative Oversight, in a manner designed to satisfy the
21 anticipated annual demand for distributions from that fund for the agency. The fee amounts
22 identified must be reasonable, must not unreasonably impede the activities of the regulated
23 entity and must be designed to reflect the anticipated cost to the agency of oversight of the
24 regulated entity and addressing any potential violations by the regulated entity, including
25 any costs of corrective action or remediation undertaken by the agency. By January 1, 2026,
26 the office must submit a report to the Joint Standing Committee on State and Local
27 Government outlining its recommendations for imposing such additional fee amounts,
28 including necessary proposed legislation, and the committee may report out related
29 legislation. The recommendations and proposed legislation must be designed to provide for
30 assessment and collection of the additional fee amounts beginning July 1, 2026 and must
31 provide that of those fee amounts collected, 1/2 must be retained by the state agency
32 assessing the fee to support its oversight and enforcement activities and 1/2 must be
33 transferred to the Fund for Administrative Oversight to support activities under that fund.
