1 SUMMARY
22 This bill specifies that an employer may use employer surveillance only if the employer
33 informs the employee before beginning employer surveillance. It prohibits an employer
44 from using audiovisual monitoring in an employee's residence or personal vehicle or on the
55 employee's property and provides that an employee can decline a request by an employer
66 to install data collection or transmission applications on the employee's personal electronic
77 devices for the purposes of employer surveillance. It requires that an employer notify a
88 prospective employee during the interview process that the employer engages in employer
99 surveillance. It gives rule-making authority to the Department of Labor. It also creates a
1100 private right of action for persons aggrieved by a violation by an employer.
