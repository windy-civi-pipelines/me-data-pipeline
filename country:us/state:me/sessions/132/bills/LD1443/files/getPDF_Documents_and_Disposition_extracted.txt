1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the Department of Health and Human Services has experienced delays in
4 awarding contracts to, finalizing contracts with and making payments to behavioral health
5 service providers, housing assistance providers and other similar nonprofit service
6 providers; and

11 Whereas, without timely contract awards, finalization and payment from the
12 department, a service provider must pay expenses, including staff salaries and rent, out of
13 the provider's own line of credit, which can create cash flow challenges that threaten the
14 provider's solvency and the availability of services; and
15 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
16 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
17 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
18 therefore,
19 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
