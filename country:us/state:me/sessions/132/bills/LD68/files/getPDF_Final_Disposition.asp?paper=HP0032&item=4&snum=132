Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
PART A
Sec. A-1. 33 MRSA §203, first ¶, as amended by PL 2019, c. 607, Pt. A, §3, is
further amended to read:
Deeds and all other written instruments before recording in the registries of deeds,
except those issued by a court of competent jurisdiction and duly attested by the proper

financing statements as provided in Title 11, section 9‑1501, subsection (1), paragraph (a),
and excepting notices of liens for internal revenue taxes and certificates discharging such

and Part 9 when filed by the State Tax Assessor, and releases discharging such liens, must

or by one of them, or by their attorney executing the same, or by the lessor in a lease or one
of the lessors or lessor's attorney executing the same, before a notary public in the State, or
before an attorney-at-law duly admitted and eligible to practice in the courts of the State,
if within the State; or before any clerk of a court of record having a seal, notary public or
commissioner appointed by the Governor of this State for the purpose, or a commissioner

country.
Sec. A-2. 36 MRSA §693, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2017, c. 170, Pt. B, §8, is
further amended to read:
1. Reporting. On or before April May 1st of each year, a taxpayer claiming an
exemption under this subchapter shall file a report with the assessor of the taxing
jurisdiction in which the property would otherwise be subject to taxation on April 1st of
that year. The report must identify the property for which exemption is claimed that would
otherwise be subject to taxation on April 1st of that year and must be made on a form
Page 1 - 132LR0155(04)

prescribed by the State Tax Assessor or substitute form approved by the State Tax Assessor.
The State Tax Assessor shall furnish copies of access to the form to each municipality in
the State and the form must be made available to taxpayers prior to April 1st annually. The
assessor of the taxing jurisdiction may require the taxpayer to sign the form and make oath
to its truth. If the report is not filed by April 1st, the filing deadline is automatically
extended to May 1st without the need for the taxpayer to request or the assessor to grant
that extension. Upon written request, before the commitment of taxes, the assessor may
grant further extensions, for good cause, an extension of time not to exceed 3 months to
file the report. If a taxpayer fails to file the report in a timely manner, including any
extensions extension of time, the taxpayer may not obtain an exemption for that property
under this subchapter for that tax year. The assessor of the taxing jurisdiction may require
in writing that a taxpayer answer in writing all reasonable inquiries as to the property for
which exemption is requested. A taxpayer has 30 days from receipt of such an inquiry to
respond. Upon written request, a taxpayer is entitled to a 30-day extension to respond to
the inquiry and the assessor may at any time grant additional extensions to respond to the
inquiry upon written request. The answer to any such inquiry is not binding on the assessor.
All notices and requests provided pursuant to this subsection must be made by personal
delivery or certified mail and must conspicuously state the consequences of the taxpayer's
failure to respond to the notice or request in a timely manner.
If an exemption has already been accepted and the State Tax Assessor subsequently
determines that the property is not entitled to exemption, a supplemental assessment must
be made within 3 years of the original assessment date with respect to the property in
compliance with section 713, without regard to the limitations contained in that section
regarding the justification necessary for a supplemental assessment.
