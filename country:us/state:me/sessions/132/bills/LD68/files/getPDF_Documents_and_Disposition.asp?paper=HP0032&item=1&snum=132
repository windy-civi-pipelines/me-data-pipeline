23 Sec. A-2. 36 MRSA §693, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2017, c. 170, Pt. B, §8, is
24 further amended to read:
25 1. Reporting. On or before April May 1st of each year, a taxpayer claiming an
26 exemption under this subchapter shall file a report with the assessor of the taxing
27 jurisdiction in which the property would otherwise be subject to taxation on April 1st of
28 that year. The report must identify the property for which exemption is claimed that would
29 otherwise be subject to taxation on April 1st of that year and must be made on a form
30 prescribed by the State Tax Assessor or substitute form approved by the State Tax Assessor.
31 The State Tax Assessor shall furnish copies of access to the form to each municipality in
32 the State and the form must be made available to taxpayers prior to April 1st annually. The
33 assessor of the taxing jurisdiction may require the taxpayer to sign the form and make oath
34 to its truth. If the report is not filed by April 1st, the filing deadline is automatically
35 extended to May 1st without the need for the taxpayer to request or the assessor to grant
36 that extension. Upon written request, before the commitment of taxes, the assessor may
37 grant further extensions, for good cause, an extension of time not to exceed 3 months to
38 file the report. If a taxpayer fails to file the report in a timely manner, including any
39 extensions extension of time, the taxpayer may not obtain an exemption for that property
40 under this subchapter for that tax year. The assessor of the taxing jurisdiction may require
41 in writing that a taxpayer answer in writing all reasonable inquiries as to the property for
42 which exemption is requested. A taxpayer has 30 days from receipt of such an inquiry to
43 respond. Upon written request, a taxpayer is entitled to a 30-day extension to respond to
44 the inquiry and the assessor may at any time grant additional extensions to respond to the
45 inquiry upon written request. The answer to any such inquiry is not binding on the assessor.

1 All notices and requests provided pursuant to this subsection must be made by personal
2 delivery or certified mail and must conspicuously state the consequences of the taxpayer's
3 failure to respond to the notice or request in a timely manner.
4 If an exemption has already been accepted and the State Tax Assessor subsequently
5 determines that the property is not entitled to exemption, a supplemental assessment must
6 be made within 3 years of the original assessment date with respect to the property in
7 compliance with section 713, without regard to the limitations contained in that section
8 regarding the justification necessary for a supplemental assessment.
