3 Sec. B-2. 26 MRSA §42, first ¶, as amended by PL 2023, c. 412, Pt. AAA, §3, is
4 further amended to read:
5 The bureau shall collect, assort and arrange statistical details relating to all departments
6 of labor and industrial pursuits in the State; to trade unions and other labor organizations
7 and their effect upon labor and capital; to the number and character of industrial accidents
8 and their effect upon the injured, their dependent relatives and upon the general public; to
9 other matters relating to the commercial, industrial, social, educational, moral and sanitary
10 conditions prevailing within the State, including the names of firms, companies or
11 corporations, where located, the kind of goods produced or manufactured, the time operated
12 each year, the number of employees classified according to age and sex and the daily and
13 average wages paid each employee; and the exploitation of such other subjects as will tend
14 to promote the permanent prosperity of the industries of the State. The director is authorized
15 and empowered, subject to the approval of the Governor, to accept from any other agency
16 of government, individual, group or corporation such funds as may be available in carrying
17 out this section, and meet such requirements with respect to the administration of such
18 funds, not inconsistent with this section, as are required as conditions precedent to receiving
19 such funds. An accounting of such funds and a report of the use to which they were put
20 must be included in the biennial report to the Governor. Each agency of government shall
21 cooperate fully with the bureau's efforts to compile labor and industrial statistics. The
22 director shall cause to be enforced all laws regulating the employment of minors; all laws
23 established for the protection of health, lives and limbs of operators in workshops and
24 factories, on railroads and in other places; all laws regulating the payment of wages; and
25 all laws enacted for the protection of the working classes. During an investigation to
26 enforce those laws, the director may request records and other information relating to an
27 employer's compliance with unemployment compensation and workers' compensation
28 laws, including information needed to determine whether the employer has properly
29 classified a worker as an independent contractor, and shall report suspected violations of
30 those laws to the state or federal agency responsible for enforcing them. The director may
31 adopt, in accordance with the Maine Administrative Procedure Act, rules regarding all such
32 laws, except where this authority is granted to a board or commission. Rules adopted
33 pursuant to this section are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375,
34 subchapter 2‑A. The director shall, on or before the first day of July, biennially, report to
35 the Governor, and may make such suggestions and recommendations as the director may
36 deem necessary for the information of the Legislature. The director may from time to time
37 cause to be printed and distributed bulletins upon any subject that is of public interest and
38 benefit to the State, including, but not limited to, the voluntary paid family and medical
39 leave benefits program established in chapter 7, subchapter 6‑C 6-D, and may conduct a
40 program of research, education and promotion to reduce industrial accidents. The director
41 may review various data, such as workers' compensation records, as well as other
42 information relating to any public or private employer's safety experience. When any
43 individual public or private employer's safety experience causes the director to question
44 seriously the safe working environment of that employer, the director may offer any safety
45 education and consultation programs to that employer that may be beneficial in providing
46 a safer work environment. If the employer refuses this assistance or is in serious
47 noncompliance which that may lead to injuries, or if serious threats to worker safety
Page 2 - 132LR0757(01)
418 continue, then the director shall communicate concerns to appropriate agencies, such as the
429 United States Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration. As
530 used in this section, the term "noncompliance" means a lack of compliance with any
541 applicable health and safety regulations of the United States Department of Labor,
552 Occupational Safety and Health Administration or other federal agencies. The bureau is
563 responsible for the enforcement of indoor air quality and ventilation standards with respect
574 to state-owned buildings and buildings leased by the State. The bureau shall enforce air
585 quality standards in a manner to ensure that corrections to problems found in buildings be
596 made over a reasonable period of time, using consent agreements and other approaches as
1507 necessary and reasonable.
11 Sec. B-3. 26 MRSA §42-B, sub-§1, ¶H, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 412, Pt. AAA,

25 SUMMARY

2299 Labor under the paid family and medical leave benefits program and requires an employer
3300 that deducted a portion of the premium required for an employee from that employee's
3311 wages to remit that portion of the premium to the employee as part of the employee's wages.
3322 Part A also requires the State Controller to transfer unappropriated funds from the
3333 Department of Labor, Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance Fund, Other Special
3344 Revenue Funds account to the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund.
35 Part B of the bill establishes a voluntary paid family and medical leave program for
36 employers of 50 or more employees and also allows individual employees whose
37 employers do not participate in the program to voluntarily participate. Part B requires the
38 Commissioner of Labor to contract with an insurance company authorized to do business
39 in this State to provide this coverage after a competitive bidding process. The commissioner
40 is required to issue the request for proposals no later than January 1, 2026, and voluntary
41 paid family and medical leave coverage must be available for purchase no later than
42 January 1, 2027. The program provides employees who are eligible for paid family and
Page 8 - 132LR0757(01)
413 medical leave with 60% of their average weekly wage, up to a maximum amount based on
424 the cap on wages eligible for social security benefits, for up to 6 weeks per year.

5 The bureau shall collect, assort and arrange statistical details relating to all departments
6 of labor and industrial pursuits in the State; to trade unions and other labor organizations
7 and their effect upon labor and capital; to the number and character of industrial accidents
8 and their effect upon the injured, their dependent relatives and upon the general public; to
9 other matters relating to the commercial, industrial, social, educational, moral and sanitary
10 conditions prevailing within the State, including the names of firms, companies or
11 corporations, where located, the kind of goods produced or manufactured, the time operated
12 each year, the number of employees classified according to age and sex and the daily and
13 average wages paid each employee; and the exploitation of such other subjects as will tend
14 to promote the permanent prosperity of the industries of the State. The director is authorized
15 and empowered, subject to the approval of the Governor, to accept from any other agency
16 of government, individual, group or corporation such funds as may be available in carrying
17 out this section, and meet such requirements with respect to the administration of such
18 funds, not inconsistent with this section, as are required as conditions precedent to receiving
19 such funds. An accounting of such funds and a report of the use to which they were put
20 must be included in the biennial report to the Governor. Each agency of government shall
21 cooperate fully with the bureau's efforts to compile labor and industrial statistics. The
22 director shall cause to be enforced all laws regulating the employment of minors; all laws
23 established for the protection of health, lives and limbs of operators in workshops and
24 factories, on railroads and in other places; all laws regulating the payment of wages; and
25 all laws enacted for the protection of the working classes. During an investigation to
26 enforce those laws, the director may request records and other information relating to an
27 employer's compliance with unemployment compensation and workers' compensation
28 laws, including information needed to determine whether the employer has properly
29 classified a worker as an independent contractor, and shall report suspected violations of
30 those laws to the state or federal agency responsible for enforcing them. The director may
31 adopt, in accordance with the Maine Administrative Procedure Act, rules regarding all such
32 laws, except where this authority is granted to a board or commission. Rules adopted
33 pursuant to this section are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375,
34 subchapter 2‑A. The director shall, on or before the first day of July, biennially, report to
35 the Governor, and may make such suggestions and recommendations as the director may
36 deem necessary for the information of the Legislature. The director may from time to time
37 cause to be printed and distributed bulletins upon any subject that is of public interest and
38 benefit to the State, including, but not limited to, the voluntary paid family and medical
39 leave benefits program established in chapter 7, subchapter 6‑C 6-D, and may conduct a
40 program of research, education and promotion to reduce industrial accidents. The director
41 may review various data, such as workers' compensation records, as well as other
42 information relating to any public or private employer's safety experience. When any
43 individual public or private employer's safety experience causes the director to question
44 seriously the safe working environment of that employer, the director may offer any safety
45 education and consultation programs to that employer that may be beneficial in providing
46 a safer work environment. If the employer refuses this assistance or is in serious
47 noncompliance which that may lead to injuries, or if serious threats to worker safety
Page 2 - 132LR0757(01)

418 continue, then the director shall communicate concerns to appropriate agencies, such as the
429 United States Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration. As
530 used in this section, the term "noncompliance" means a lack of compliance with any
541 applicable health and safety regulations of the United States Department of Labor,
552 Occupational Safety and Health Administration or other federal agencies. The bureau is
563 responsible for the enforcement of indoor air quality and ventilation standards with respect
574 to state-owned buildings and buildings leased by the State. The bureau shall enforce air
585 quality standards in a manner to ensure that corrections to problems found in buildings be
596 made over a reasonable period of time, using consent agreements and other approaches as
1507 necessary and reasonable.

3333 Department of Labor, Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance Fund, Other Special
3344 Revenue Funds account to the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund.
35 Part B of the bill establishes a voluntary paid family and medical leave program for
36 employers of 50 or more employees and also allows individual employees whose
37 employers do not participate in the program to voluntarily participate. Part B requires the
38 Commissioner of Labor to contract with an insurance company authorized to do business
39 in this State to provide this coverage after a competitive bidding process. The commissioner
40 is required to issue the request for proposals no later than January 1, 2026, and voluntary
41 paid family and medical leave coverage must be available for purchase no later than
42 January 1, 2027. The program provides employees who are eligible for paid family and
Page 8 - 132LR0757(01)
