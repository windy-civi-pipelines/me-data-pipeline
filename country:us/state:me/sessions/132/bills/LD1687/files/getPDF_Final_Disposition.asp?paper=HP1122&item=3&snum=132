been prescribed, dispensed and administered by a pharmacist under Title 32, section
13786-E. Coverage under this section is subject to the following.
A. If the federal Food and Drug Administration has approved one or more HIV
prevention drugs that use the same method of administration, a carrier is not required
to cover all approved drugs as long as the carrier covers at least one approved drug for
each method of administration with no out-of-pocket cost. Notwithstanding this
paragraph, a carrier shall provide coverage with no out-of-pocket cost for HIV
prevention drugs for the prevention of the acquisition of HIV infection in accordance
with a rating of A or B in the recommendations of the United States Preventive Services
Task Force or equivalent rating from a successor organization and guidelines issued by
the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services.
B. A carrier is not required to cover any preexposure prophylaxis drug or post-
exposure prophylaxis drug dispensed or administered by an out-of-network pharmacy
provider unless the enrollee's health plan provides an out-of-network pharmacy benefit.
C. A carrier may not prohibit, or permit a pharmacy benefits manager to prohibit, a
pharmacy provider from prescribing, dispensing or administering any HIV prevention
drugs.
D. A carrier shall authorize a pharmacist to bill the carrier and receive direct payment
for a service that the pharmacist provides to an enrollee pursuant to this section and
shall identify the pharmacist as the provider in the billing and claims process for
payment for the service. A carrier may not impose on a pharmacist, in order for the
pharmacist to receive payment for a service provided pursuant to this section, a
practice, education or collaboration requirement that is inconsistent with or more
restrictive than a requirement of state law or agency or board rules.
Sec. 3. 24-A MRSA §4317-D, sub-§3, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 265, §4, is
amended to read:
3. Limits on prior authorization and step therapy requirements. Notwithstanding
any requirements in section 4304 or 4320‑N to the contrary, a carrier may not subject any
HIV prevention drug to any prior authorization or step therapy requirement except as
provided in this subsection. If the federal Food and Drug Administration has approved one
or more methods of administering HIV prevention drugs, a carrier is not required to cover
all of the approved drugs without prior authorization or step therapy requirements as long
as the carrier covers at least one approved drug for each method of administration without
prior authorization or step therapy requirements. Notwithstanding this subsection, a carrier
shall provide coverage without prior authorization or step therapy requirements for HIV
prevention drugs for the prevention of the acquisition of HIV infection in accordance with
a rating of A or B in the recommendations of the United States Preventive Services Task
Force or equivalent rating from a successor organization and guidelines issued by the
United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services. If prior authorization or step therapy requirements are met for a
particular enrollee with regard to a particular HIV prevention drug, the carrier is required
to cover that drug with no out-of-pocket cost to the enrollee.
Sec. 4. 32 MRSA §13786-E, sub-§2, ¶B, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 265, §6, is
