13 SUMMARY
1144 This amendment removes the language in the bill requiring pharmacists to be
1155 reimbursed at the same reimbursement rates as physicians for the dispensing or
1166 administering of HIV prevention medications. The amendment retains the clarification in
1177 the bill that health insurance carriers are required to provide coverage for HIV prevention
1188 medications, including injectable preexposure prophylaxis drugs of any duration. The
1199 amendment reallocates the provision requiring health insurance carriers to provide
2200 coverage for the services provided by pharmacists to the Maine Insurance Code and makes
2211 other clarifying changes to the bill. The amendment also adds an appropriations and
2222 allocations section.
