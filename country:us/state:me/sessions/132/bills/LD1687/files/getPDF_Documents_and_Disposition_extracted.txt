27 SUMMARY
2288 This bill clarifies, with respect to insurance coverage for HIV prevention medication,

3300 of administration. The bill clarifies that pharmacists are allowed to dispense HIV
3311 preventive oral medication under current law, allows pharmacists to dispense injectable
3322 medication of any duration in certain circumstances and requires insurance carriers to treat
3333 pharmacists dispensing HIV drugs in a manner equivalent to how the insurance carriers
3344 treat physicians and allow pharmacists to bill the carriers and receive payment directly.
3355 The bill also provides reimbursement under the MaineCare program to pharmacists for
3366 prescribing, dispensing and administering HIV prevention drugs.
