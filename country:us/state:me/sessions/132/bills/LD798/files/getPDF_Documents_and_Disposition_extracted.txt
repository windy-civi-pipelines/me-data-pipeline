6 direction of the Governor, to issue bonds in the name and on behalf of the State in an
7 amount not exceeding $50,000,000 for the purposes described in section 5 of this Act. The

14 Sec. 3. Sale; how negotiated; proceeds appropriated. The Treasurer of State
15 may negotiate the sale of the bonds by direction of the Governor, but no bond may be

5 within 5 years of ratification of this Act are deauthorized and may not be issued, except

8 to exceed 5 years.

10 question; effective date. This Act must be submitted to the legal voters of the State at
11 a statewide election held in the month of November following passage of this Act. The

13 and plantations to meet, in the manner prescribed by law for holding a statewide election,
14 to vote on the acceptance or rejection of this Act by voting on the following question:
15 "Do you favor a $50,000,000 bond issue to help finance the design and
16 construction or the retrofitting of a manufacturing facility to produce mass
17 timber in the State using sustainably harvested Maine forest products?"
18 The legal voters of each city, town and plantation shall vote by ballot on this question
19 and designate their choice by a cross or check mark placed within a corresponding square
20 below the word "Yes" or "No." The ballots must be received, sorted, counted and declared
21 in open ward, town and plantation meetings and returns made to the Secretary of State in
22 the same manner as votes for members of the Legislature. The Governor shall review the
23 returns. If a majority of the legal votes are cast in favor of this Act, the Governor shall
24 proclaim the result without delay and this Act becomes effective 30 days after the date of
25 the proclamation.
