11 SUMMARY
1122 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, changes the title of the
1133 bill. It amends the automotive right to repair law by repealing the provisions of that law
1144 that established an independent entity and instead establishes the Motor Vehicle Right to
1155 Repair Commission, which is charged with, among other things, monitoring and assessing
1166 implementation of and manufacturers' compliance with the requirements of that law. The
1177 amendment also makes other clarifying changes to the automotive right to repair law,
1188 including changes regarding the required equipment under that law, access to diagnostic
1199 and repair functions and enforcement of the law.
