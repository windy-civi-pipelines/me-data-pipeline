22 SUMMARY
2233 This bill eliminates the limited time period that previously applied to the directive to
2244 assign forward capacity market payments exclusively for heat pumps and adds electric
2255 vehicles as an additional eligible use of the forward capacity market funds, while leaving
2266 in place the authorization for these funds to be used for heat pumps as well. The bill also
2277 updates language regarding the allowable use of forward capacity market funds to promote
2288 beneficial electrification, to supplement incentives that support beneficial electrification
2299 measures and to reliably reduce electricity rates.
