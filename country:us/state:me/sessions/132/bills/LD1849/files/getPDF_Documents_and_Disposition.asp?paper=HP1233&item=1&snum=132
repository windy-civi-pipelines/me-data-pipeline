36 SUMMARY
3377 This bill modifies provisions of the Maine Juvenile Code.
38 The bill changes the definition of "juvenile" to mean a person who had attained 11
39 years of age but not 18 years of age at the time the person committed an alleged juvenile
40 crime, except that, for the crimes of murder, felony murder and manslaughter and the
41 criminal attempt of those crimes, there is no minimum age.
Page 5 - 132LR0688(01)

1 Under current law, the definition of "juvenile crime" limits which crimes established
2 under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 12 and Title 29-A that a juvenile may be charged
3 with. Under current law, only specifically named crimes within those Titles are considered
4 juvenile crimes. The bill removes the language establishing these limitations so that any
5 crime under Title 12 and Title 29-A is considered a juvenile crime if committed by a
6 juvenile. The Maine Juvenile Code provides for the disposition following adjudication for
7 certain juvenile crimes. The bill adjusts the provisions related to the disposition following
8 adjudication for violations of Title 12 and Title 29-A.
9 The bill also corrects cross-references related to these changes.
