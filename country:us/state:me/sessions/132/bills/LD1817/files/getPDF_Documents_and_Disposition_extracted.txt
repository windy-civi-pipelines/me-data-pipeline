1 SUMMARY
22 This bill is reported out by the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary to implement a
33 recommendation of the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services. The committee
44 has not taken a position on the substance of this bill. By reporting this bill out, the
55 committee is not suggesting and does not intend to suggest that it agrees or disagrees with
66 any aspect of this bill; instead, the committee is reporting the bill out for the sole purpose
77 of having a bill printed that can be referred to the committee for an appropriate public
88 hearing and subsequent processing in the normal course. The committee is taking this
99 action to ensure clarity and transparency in the legislative review of the proposals contained
1100 in the bill.
11 The bill repeals the provision of the Maine Bail Code making it a crime for a defendant
12 to violate a condition of that defendant's release on preconviction or post-conviction bail.
13 The bill does not, however, prevent a defendant from being charged with a crime, other
14 than violation of conditional release, for criminal conduct that the defendant allegedly
15 commits while on preconviction or post-conviction bail. The bill does not prevent a court
16 from revoking or modifying the defendant's preconviction or post-conviction bail on the
17 basis of the bail violation.
