6 category of drug, a combination of specific categories of drugs or a combination of alcohol
7 and one or more specific categories of drugs, that person must submit to a blood or urine
8 test tests selected by the drug recognition expert law enforcement officer to confirm that
9 person's category of drug or alcohol use and determine the presence or level of the any
10 drug, drug metabolite or alcohol.
11 Sec. 2. 29-A MRSA §2525, sub-§5 is enacted to read:
12 5. Suspension of license for refusal. The Secretary of State, in accordance with the
13 procedures described in section 2521, shall immediately suspend the license of a person
14 who fails to submit to and complete a test administered under this section.
15 SUMMARY
1166 This bill amends the provision of the motor vehicles and traffic law governing drug
1177 impairment assessments. Under current law, a person is required to submit to a blood or
1188 urine test selected by a drug recognition expert if that drug recognition expert has probable
1199 cause to believe that the person is under the influence of a specific category of drug, a
2200 combination of specific categories of drugs or a combination of alcohol and one or more
2211 specific categories of drugs. The bill changes this provision by broadening the probable
2222 cause to include impairment caused by "a drug" or "drugs" generally, replacing "drug
2233 recognition expert" with "law enforcement officer" and modifying the requirements
2244 pertaining to the type of test or tests required under the provision.
25 The bill also adds a provision clarifying that the Secretary of State is required to
26 immediately suspend the driver's license of a person who fails to submit to and complete a
27 test under the provision of law governing drug impairment assessments in accordance with
28 existing procedures.
