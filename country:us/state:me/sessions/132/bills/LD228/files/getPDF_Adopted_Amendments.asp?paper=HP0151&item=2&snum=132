10 Seawalls to Be Raised by up to 2 Feet in Order to Accommodate Predicted Sea Level Rise”
11 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the
12 emergency clause and inserting the following:
13 'Sec. 1. 38 MRSA §480-E, sub-§15, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 97, §1, is amended
14 to read:
15 15. Coastal sand dune system restoration projects; stabilization materials. The
16 department may authorize through a permit or a permit by rule under this article a coastal
17 sand dune system restoration project that uses allowable stabilization materials for the
18 planting of native dune vegetation as long as the project meets the requirements of this
19 subsection and satisfies all other applicable requirements for the permit or permit by rule.
20 A. Allowable stabilization materials may be used or placed only above the highest
21 annual tide as measured at the time the project construction begins. Allowable
22 stabilization materials may be used or placed in high‑velocity zones, or V-Zones, as
23 identified by the United States Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency
24 Management Agency in effective flood insurance rate maps under the National Flood
25 Insurance Program.
26 B. The slope of the constructed dune may not be steeper than the slope of the existing
27 dune in which the allowable stabilization materials are used or placed, except where
28 the constructed dune is placed on, or on the landward side of, an existing seawall.
29 C. Allowable stabilization materials must be used or placed in a manner designed to
30 encourage the revegetation of the dune with native dune vegetation and, except where
31 the constructed dune is placed on, or on the landward side of, an existing seawall, must
32 remain covered with sand and native dune vegetation throughout and upon completion
33 of the project.
34 D. Allowable stabilization materials containing or using gravel or cobble may be used
35 or placed only in a dune primarily composed of gravel or cobble or directly adjacent to
36 a beach that is primarily gravel or cobble. Placement of allowable stabilization

317 materials containing or using gravel or cobble must involve the use of gravel or cobble
328 from the dune system or beach or gravel or cobble of a similar texture and color of the
339 gravel or cobble of the dune system or beach.
4 E. A Except as provided in paragraph F, a project that will use or place stakes, anchors
5 or cables made from metal or other nonbiodegradable materials or fabrics, blankets or
6 other stabilization materials made from polylactic acid polymers is not eligible for a
7 permit by rule but may be issued a permit under this article.
8 F. A project that will use or place stakes, anchors or cables made from metal, whether
9 alone or in conjunction with allowable stabilization materials, is eligible for a permit
10 by rule under this article and in accordance with the requirements of this subsection
11 only if the project is constructed on, or on the landward side of, an existing seawall.
12 The use or placement of allowable stabilization materials within a coastal sand dune system
13 in accordance with a permit or a permit by rule authorized by the department pursuant to
14 this subsection is not considered a permanent structure under this article.
15 For the purposes of this subsection, "allowable stabilization materials" means natural,
16 plant-based biodegradable or compostable fabrics, erosion control blankets, logs or rolls
17 made from coir, jute, straw, polylactic acid polymers or other similar materials, including
18 materials that contain or use gravel or cobble, discarded holiday trees, other trees fallen or
19 washed up in proximity to the site and stakes, anchors or cables used to secure those
20 materials. For the purposes of this subsection, "native dune vegetation" means dune plant
21 species typically adapted to coastal sand dune systems in the State, including, but not
22 limited to, American beach grass, Rosa virginiana, bayberry, beach pea, beach heather and
23 pitch pine. For the purposes of this subsection, "existing seawall" means a seawall that
24 legally existed on January 1, 2025.
25 Sec. 2. 38 MRSA §480-E, sub-§19 is enacted to read:
26 19. Height increase of existing seawall in coastal sand dune system.
27 Notwithstanding any provision of this article to the contrary, the department may authorize
28 a one-time increase in the height of a seawall or similar structure in a coastal sand dune
29 system through a permit under this article if the following conditions are met.
30 A. The seawall legally existed on January 1, 2025 and the lot or parcel that contains
31 the seawall:
32 (1) Is no larger than 15,000 square feet and contains a residential dwelling that
33 legally existed on or was legally reconstructed after January 1, 2025;
34 (2) Is no larger than 25,000 square feet and contains a commercial building that
35 legally existed on or was legally reconstructed after January 1, 2025; or
36 (3) Contains a road that legally existed on or was legally reconstructed after
37 January 1, 2025.
38 B. The residential dwelling, commercial building or road on the lot or parcel that
39 contains the seawall, as identified pursuant to paragraph A, is located within 25 feet,
40 horizontal distance, of the landward side of the seawall, or the lot or parcel abuts one
41 or more lots or parcels along the same shoreline that each contain seawalls that have
42 been or are permitted to be increased in height pursuant to this subsection.

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 151, L.D. 228
1 C. A sand dune located seaward of the seawall that remains dry during the highest
2 astronomical tide plus 1.5 feet of sea level rise:
3 (1) Does not exist at the time of application; and
4 (2) As determined by the department, cannot be created through restoration,
5 reconstruction or construction activities in accordance with the department's permit
6 by rule standards.
7 D. The height of the seawall is increased by no more than 2 feet, as long as:
8 (1) The height of the seawall, after the increase, is not more than one foot above
9 the base flood elevation; and
10 (2) The dimensions of the seawall are not otherwise modified.
11 The applicant may add sand, cobble or allowable stabilization materials on the
12 landward side of the seawall to provide structural stability for the increase in the height
13 of the seawall.
14 E. The applicant must agree to mitigate, through beach nourishment or other activities
15 directed by the department, any increased scouring or erosion on the seaward side of
16 the seawall that may result from the seawall height increase.
17 F. If there is sufficient space, as determined by the department, between the seawall
18 and the residential dwelling, commercial building or road on the lot or parcel that
19 contains the seawall, as identified pursuant to paragraph A, the applicant must, on the
20 landward side of the seawall:
21 (1) Construct a sand dune covered with native dune vegetation in a manner
22 consistent with department rule; or
23 (2) If there is not sufficient space to construct a sand dune, plant a vegetative buffer
24 consisting of native dune vegetation.
25 G. If practicable, as determined by the department, the residential dwelling or
26 commercial building on the lot or parcel that contains the seawall, as identified
27 pursuant to paragraph A, must be elevated on a post or piling foundation that allows
28 for the free movement of water, wind and sand in a manner consistent with department
29 rule and prior to or at the time that the seawall is increased in height pursuant to this
30 subsection.
31 H. The seawall, if increased in height pursuant to this subsection, must connect to a
32 seawall of the same or greater height on each abutting lot or parcel along the same
33 shoreline, except that, if an abutting lot or parcel along the same shoreline does not
34 contain a seawall that the seawall can connect to, the applicant must:
35 (1) Through legally binding agreement, including, but not limited to, an easement
36 or contract, obtain permission for the seawall height increase from the owner of
37 each abutting lot or parcel along the same shoreline that does not contain a seawall
38 that the seawall can connect to; and
39 (2) Agree to mitigate, through periodic dune restoration or beach nourishment
40 activities as directed by the department, any increased end-effect erosion on each
41 abutting lot or parcel along the same shoreline that may result from the seawall
42 height increase.

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 151, L.D. 228
1 I. For any seawall that is part of a project involving an increase in the height of seawalls
2 located on 5 or more abutting lots or parcels along the same shoreline, the seawall
3 height increase on all the abutting lots or parcels may not be expected to result in an
4 increase in the extent or intensity of a predicted 100-year flood event on other abutting
5 or adjacent lots that may cause the Federal Emergency Management Agency to revise
6 the relevant flood insurance map to account for that increase, as determined by the
7 department based on a standard engineering analysis provided by the applicant and any
8 other information available to the department.
9 This subsection does not prevent the department from permitting, in accordance with
10 adopted rules, the replacement of an existing seawall with a seawall of different dimensions
11 or in a different location that is further landward if the department determines that the
12 replacement seawall would be less damaging to the coastal sand dune system, existing
13 wildlife habitat and adjacent properties than replacing the existing seawall with a seawall
14 of the same dimensions in the same location.
15 For the purposes of this subsection, "allowable stabilization materials" and "native dune
16 vegetation" have the same meanings as in subsection 15.
17 Sec. 3. 38 MRSA §480-W, sub-§4, as enacted by PL 2005, c. 548, §2, is amended
18 to read:
19 4. Replacement after emergency action under permit by rule. Notwithstanding
20 any other provision of this chapter, the department shall approve a permit by rule to repair
21 or replace a seawall, bulkhead, retaining wall or similar structure that has been destroyed
22 or threatened with a structure that, except as provided in paragraph C, is identical in all
23 dimensions and location as long as a property owner files a completed permit-by-rule
24 notification for the repair or replacement of the structure and the following standards are
25 met:.
26 A. During project construction, disturbance of dune vegetation must be avoided and
27 native vegetation must be retained on the lot to the maximum extent possible. Any
28 areas of dune vegetation that are disturbed must be restored as quickly as possible.
29 Dune vegetation includes, but is not limited to, American beach grass, rugosa rose Rosa
30 virginiana, bayberry, beach pea, beach heather and pitch pine.
31 B. Sand may not be moved seaward of the frontal dune between April 1st and
32 September 1st unless the owner has obtained written approval from the Department of
33 Inland Fisheries and Wildlife.
34 C. The replacement of a seawall may not increase the height, length or thickness of
35 the seawall beyond that which legally existed within the 24 months prior to the
36 submission of the permit-by-rule notification but may increase the height of the seawall
37 in accordance with section 480-E, subsection 19. The replaced seawall may not be
38 significantly different in construction from the one that previously existed.'
39 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section
40 number to read consecutively.
41 SUMMARY
4422 This amendment replaces the bill and amends the Natural Resources Protection Act to
4433 authorize the Department of Environmental Protection to approve a permit for a one-time
Page 4 - 132LR0419(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 151, L.D. 228
414 increase by up to 2 feet in the height of a seawall or similar structure in a coastal sand dune
425 system, as long as certain specified conditions are met. The amendment provides a similar
436 allowance for a height increase of up to 2 feet where a seawall has been destroyed or
447 threatened and is replaced after emergency action. It also makes additional clarifications to
458 the provision of the Natural Resources Protection Act regarding coastal sand dune system
469 restoration projects with respect to existing seawalls.
