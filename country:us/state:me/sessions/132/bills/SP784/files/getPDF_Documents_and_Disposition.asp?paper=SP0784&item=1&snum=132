_____
JOINT RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING MAY 2025 AS NATIONAL
ARTHRITIS AWARENESS MONTH
WHEREAS, arthritis is the number one cause of disability in the United States, affecting
nearly 60 million men, women and children, and nearly 26 million of those with arthritis are
unable to perform everyday activities; and
WHEREAS, there are more than 100 types of arthritis and related rheumatic diseases and
one in 4 adults and hundreds of thousands of children in the United States have been diagnosed
with a form of arthritis or a related illness; and
WHEREAS, contrary to the common misconception, arthritis is not just an "old person's
disease," as about 2/3 of those living with arthritis are aged 65 and under; and
WHEREAS, one in three adults with arthritis are not physically active, have fair to poor
health and have severe joint pain and most people with arthritis have comorbidities, such as
heart disease, diabetes and obesity, that further jeopardize their health; and
WHEREAS, as our nation's top cause of disability, arthritis costs the United States
economy over $300 billion annually in medical bills, lost wages and associated expenses; and
WHEREAS, in 1972, President Richard Nixon and the United States Congress designated
May as National Arthritis Month, a special time to emphasize research, service and education
around arthritis and to raise funds to support the cause and every May since then has been
marked by efforts to elevate the public's awareness of arthritis; now; therefore; be it
RESOLVED: That We, the members of the One Hundred and Thirty-second Legislature
now assembled in the First Special Session, take this occasion to recognize May 2025 as
National Arthritis Awareness Month and urge citizens of the State to learn more about arthritis,
raise awareness of the serious public health and economic issues associated with arthritis and
find ways to contribute to a cure for arthritis.
