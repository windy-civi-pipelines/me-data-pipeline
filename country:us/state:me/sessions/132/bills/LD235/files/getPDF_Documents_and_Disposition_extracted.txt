FIRST REGULAR SESSION-2025
Legislative Document No. 235
Resolve, Regarding the Operation and Future Capacity of State-
owned Landfills
(EMERGENCY)
Received by the Clerk of the House on January 16, 2025. Referred to the Committee on
Environment and Natural Resources pursuant to Joint Rule 308.2 and ordered printed pursuant

1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 38, section 1305, subsection 1 mandates
4 that "Each municipality shall provide solid waste disposal services for domestic and
5 commercial solid waste generated within the municipality and may provide these services
6 for industrial wastes and sewage treatment plant sludge"; and
7 Whereas, in the State, 115 municipalities have entered into contracts with the
8 Municipal Review Committee to satisfy this mandate through provision of municipal solid
9 waste handling, processing and disposal services at the Municipal Review Committee's
10 recycling and anaerobic digestion facility in the Town of Hampden now known as Coastal
11 Resources of Maine, LLC and approximately 44 municipalities have entered into contracts
12 with Penobscot Energy Recovery Company to satisfy this mandate through provision of
13 municipal solid waste processing and disposal services at Penobscot Energy Recovery
14 Company's waste-to-energy facility in the Town of Orrington; and
15 Whereas, the Municipal Review Committee has been unable to provide municipal
16 solid waste handling, processing and disposal services at the Coastal Resources of Maine,
17 LLC recycling and anaerobic digestion facility since its closure on May 28, 2020; and
18 Whereas, Penobscot Energy Recovery Company ceased to provide municipal solid
19 waste handling, processing and disposal services at its waste-to-energy facility as of May
20 2, 2023, and, although the facility was sold at auction in November 2023, it has yet to
21 resume operation; and
22 Whereas, as required by their solid waste disposal facility licenses issued by the
23 Department of Environmental Protection, municipal solid waste from these 159
24 municipalities has been and is being disposed of primarily at the state-owned Juniper Ridge
25 Landfill located almost entirely in the City of Old Town with a portion of the landfill right-
26 of-way access located in the Town of Alton; and
27 Whereas, the state-mandated curtailment of spreading wastewater treatment plant
28 sludge on land because of the perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances contamination
29 has resulted in the disposal of some of this sludge at the Juniper Ridge Landfill; and
30 Whereas, land disposal of waste at a landfill is the least desirable solid waste disposal
31 option under the State's solid waste management hierarchy under Title 38, section 2101;
32 and
33 Whereas, the Department of Environmental Protection approved only a partial
34 expansion of the Juniper Ridge Landfill in 2017, granting a license for a capacity of 9.3
35 million cubic yards of the available 22 million cubic yards; and
36 Whereas, as a result of this temporary increase in disposal of municipal solid waste
37 and wastewater treatment plant sludge at the Juniper Ridge Landfill, the partial expansion,
38 which was expected to last through 2033, is now expected to use that capacity by 2028,
39 thus necessitating another permitting process to complete the expansion; and
40 Whereas, the loss of municipal solid waste handling, processing and disposal services
41 at the Coastal Resources of Maine, LLC facility and at the Penobscot Energy Recovery
42 Company waste-to-energy facility and the increased rate of municipal solid waste and
Page 1 - 132LR0005(01)
413 wastewater treatment plant sludge disposal at the Juniper Ridge Landfill is creating a
424 hardship for the City of Old Town and its residents, is placing stress on the 159
435 municipalities that have statutory obligations to provide municipal solid waste disposal
446 services and is straining the resources of sewer and utility districts and departments, as well
457 as consuming valuable and finite state-owned solid waste landfill resources that are
468 supposed to be the last resort for solid waste disposal; and
7 Whereas, the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of
8 General Services is responsible for oversight and management of state-owned property,
9 including the Juniper Ridge Landfill; and
10 Whereas, under Title 38, section 2122, the Department of Environmental Protection
11 is required to "prepare an analysis of, and a plan for, the management, reduction and
12 recycling of solid waste for the State. The plan must be based on the priorities and recycling
13 goals established in sections 2101 and 2132. The plan must provide guidance and direction
14 to municipalities in planning and implementing waste management and recycling programs
15 at the state, regional and local levels" and to provide periodic updates of that plan; and
16 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
17 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
18 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
19 therefore, be it
20 Sec. 1. Report on Jay landfill. Resolved: That the Department of Environmental
21 Protection shall evaluate the potential costs and benefits to the State of the State's acquiring
22 ownership of the former paper mill landfill in the Town of Jay for the primary purpose of
23 increasing disposal capacity in the State for wastewater treatment plant sludge and special
24 waste but with consideration given to the potential for the disposal of municipal solid waste
25 at that landfill. The evaluation must include, but is not limited to, consideration of existing
26 conditions at the Jay landfill, including liner condition, leachate collection systems and the
27 presence of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and other environmental
28 contaminants; capacity, including disposal capacity and the potential for expansion of
29 capacity; facility needs in the areas of odor management, gas management and leachate
30 management and treatment; options for managing wastewater treatment plant sludge; and
31 any other conditions relevant to the potential future operation of a landfill. In conducting
32 the evaluation under this section, the Department of Environmental Protection may, as
33 necessary, consult with the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau
34 of General Services, referred to in this resolve as "the bureau."
35 On or before January 1, 2026, the Department of Environmental Protection shall submit
36 to the Joint Standing Committee on Environment and Natural Resources a report outlining
37 the findings and recommendations of the evaluation under this section and including any
38 proposed legislation. After reviewing the report, the committee may report out legislation
39 relating to the report to the Second Regular Session of the 132nd Legislature.
40 Sec. 2. Report on Old Town landfill operating services agreement.
41 Resolved: That the bureau and the Department of Environmental Protection shall evaluate
42 options for amending the operating services agreement of February 5, 2004, as amended,
43 between the bureau and the operator of the state-owned Juniper Ridge Landfill in the City
44 of Old Town concerning the operation of the landfill for the purpose of enhancing the
