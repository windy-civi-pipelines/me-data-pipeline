22 must come from the department and may be prorated if the peer support and teacher
23 mentoring program is less than one school year in duration.
24 B. The selection of mentoring teachers must be made from a list provided by or in
25 consultation with a local teacher's association.
26 C. The standards for a teacher to qualify as a mentor must, at a minimum, require a
27 mentoring teacher to have held a teaching certificate in the State for at least 5 years.

38 department shall convene a group of relevant stakeholders including administrators,
39 mentoring teachers and teachers who have participated in the peer support and teacher
40 mentoring program as part of the 7-year review. The stakeholder group shall determine
41 amendments that should be made to the peer support and teacher mentoring program. A
42 school administrative unit shall submit its peer support and teacher mentoring program to
43 the department once every 7 years. A school administrative unit shall notify the department

15 circumstances, the commissioner may waive, for no more than one year, the requirement
16 in subsection 5 that a teacher be mentored. The commissioner may only waive the

21 and implemented a peer support and teacher mentoring program may not hire conditionally
22 certified teachers or teachers who hold an emergency teacher certificate. Conditionally
