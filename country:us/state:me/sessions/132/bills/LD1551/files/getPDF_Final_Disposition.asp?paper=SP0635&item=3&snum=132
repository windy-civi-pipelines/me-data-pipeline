S.P. 635 - L.D. 1551
An Act to Support Maine Eating and Drinking Establishments by Allowing
Vendors to Operate on the Premises of an Establishment with a Liquor
License
Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, this legislation is a way to support Maine's hospitality sector and businesses
that cater to tourists, and the tourism season is crucial for the State's economy and public
well-being; and
Whereas, the tourism season, which brings millions of visitors and significant
revenue to the State, relies on a regulated and enjoyable environment, including accessible
and responsible alcohol sales; and
Whereas, for these reasons, this legislation needs to take effect before the expiration
of the 90-day period; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore,
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
Sec. 1. 28-A MRSA ยง1051-A is enacted to read:
