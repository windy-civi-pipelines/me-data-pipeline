3 ยง124. Requests for proposals for establishment of small modular nuclear reactor
4 1. Small modular nuclear reactor or modular reactor defined. As used in this
5 section, unless the context otherwise indicates, "small modular nuclear reactor" or
6 "modular reactor" means a nuclear reactor that:
7 A. Has a rated generating capacity of no more than 350 megawatts;
8 B. Is capable of being constructed and operated at a single site on its own or in
9 combination with one or more nuclear reactors; and
10 C. Is required to be licensed by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
11 2. Requests for proposals for information. By October 1st of each year, the
12 commission shall issue a request for proposals soliciting informational bids regarding the
13 establishment of a small modular nuclear reactor in the State. The informational bids must
14 include the costs of establishing a modular reactor in the State, either through manufacture
15 on site or transport into the State, the proposed location of a modular reactor, the time
16 needed to establish a modular reactor in the State, the annual operational costs of a modular
17 reactor and any other information the commission determines necessary. The bids are not
18 binding on the State or the person submitting the bid but may be used to inform and develop
19 a contract for the establishment of a modular reactor in the State.
20 3. Annual report. Beginning in 2026, by January 15th annually, the commission shall
21 submit to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy
22 and utility matters a report regarding the informational bids received by the commission

24 committee may report out legislation based on the report in the same legislative session in
25 which the report is received.
26 4. Termination. This section is repealed when the State accepts a bid for the
27 establishment of a small modular nuclear reactor. The commission shall notify the Revisor
28 of Statutes when the State accepts a bid for the establishment of a small modular nuclear
29 reactor.
