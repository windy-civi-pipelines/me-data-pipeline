3322 This bill amends the authorizations and restrictions applying to baitfish wholesaler's
3333 licenses. The bill allows a license holder to use the services of up to 2 unlicensed
3344 individuals to assist in harvest operations in inland waters of the State as long as the
3355 unlicensed individuals remain under the direct supervision of the license holder. The bill
3366 removes the restriction that prohibits a license holder from taking or selling suckers, also
3377 known as Genus Catostomus, greater than 10 inches in length between April 1st and
3388 September 30th of each year. Finally, the bill prohibits a license holder from attempting to
3399 take from inland waters live baitfish for resale using drop nets through the ice unless the
4400 license holder sufficiently marks the holes in the ice by evergreen boughs or fluorescent
4411 biodegradable tape.
