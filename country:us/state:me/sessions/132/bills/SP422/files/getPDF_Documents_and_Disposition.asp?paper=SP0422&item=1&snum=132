JOINT RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING APRIL 18, 2025 AS WORLD
AMATEUR RADIO DAY
WHEREAS, amateur radio, also known as ham radio, provides a bridge between people,
societies and countries by creating friendships and sharing ideas; and
WHEREAS, April 18, 2025 marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of the
International Amateur Radio Union, the entity that promotes the international cooperation and
communication that are the hallmarks of amateur radio; and
WHEREAS, there are nearly 780,000 federally licensed amateur radio operators in the
United States and approximately 4,500 in the State of Maine; and
WHEREAS, amateur radio is a valuable resource and, during emergencies or natural
disasters, such as the ice storm of 1998, Hurricane Katrina, the Boston Marathon bombing and
countless other emergency situations, is often the only dependable way to communicate locally
or internationally; and
WHEREAS, many Maine amateur radio operators serve their local and county emergency
management agencies by training and holding exercises to prepare for when their skills are
needed during times of emergency; and
WHEREAS, Maine amateur radio operators routinely volunteer their equipment and time
to provide public service communications for such events as the Dempsey Challenge, the Trek
Across Maine, the TD Beach to Beacon 10K Road Race, the New England Forest Rally, the
Kenduskeag Stream Canoe Race, the Can Am Crown International Sled Dog Race, the Loon
Echo Bike Trek, the Mount Desert Island Marathon, Autism Awareness walks and races and
the Northwoods Gravel Grind; and
WHEREAS, amateur radio operators of all ages provide a great inspiration for today's
youth by routinely practicing not only voice communications and the old-fashioned but reliable
Morse code but also many modern digital modes, using the ionosphere as well as a fleet of
satellites and the International Space Station to make contacts; now, therefore, be it
RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Thirty-second Legislature
now assembled in the First Regular Session, on behalf of the people we represent, take this
opportunity to recognize and acknowledge the accomplishments and public service provided
by amateur radio operators as they celebrate World Amateur Radio Day on the 100th
anniversary of the founding of the International Amateur Radio Union; and be it further
RESOLVED: That suitable copies of this resolution, duly authenticated by the Secretary
of State, be transmitted to the American Radio Relay League and the International Amateur
Radio Union.
