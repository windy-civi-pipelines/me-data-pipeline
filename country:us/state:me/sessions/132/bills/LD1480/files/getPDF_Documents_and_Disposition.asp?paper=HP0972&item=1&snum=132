2255 This bill creates an exception to the law that a learner's permit applicant must complete

2288 education course and has successfully passed all parts of an examination other than the
2299 driving test to apply for a learner's permit. A learner's permit issued to a person who is 15

3311 parent or guardian or another responsible adult who is licensed to operate the class of
3322 vehicle operated by the permittee, has held a license for at least 2 years and is at least 25
3333 years of age. The accompanying operator must be seated beside the driver and is
3344 responsible for any violation of motor vehicle and traffic laws by the permittee. The bill
3355 also allows a person who is at least 18 years of age and who takes a driver education course
3366 that includes only classroom instruction through an adult education program to apply for
3377 or be issued a learner's permit upon successful completion of the course.
