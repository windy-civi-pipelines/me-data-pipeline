19 SUMMARY
2200 This bill:
21 1. Requires the emergency powers exercised by the Governor, a person within the
22 executive branch or a municipal official that bind, curtail or infringe on the rights of private
23 parties to be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling public health or safety purpose and to
24 be limited in duration, applicability and scope to reduce any infringement of individual
25 liberty. Only the Governor may issue an order that infringes on a right guaranteed under
26 the United States Constitution or the Constitution of Maine, including, but not limited to,
27 freedom of travel, assembly, work, speech and religion and freedom to purchase and
28 possess firearms and ammunition. That order must be narrowly tailored to serve a
29 compelling public health or safety purpose limited in duration, applicability and scope to
30 reduce any infringement of a constitutional right;
31 2. Gives a state court jurisdiction to hear a case challenging the legality of the exercise
32 of emergency powers and requires the court to expedite consideration of the case to the
33 extent practicable. Inequality in the applicability of the impact of emergency orders on
34 analogous groups, situations and circumstances may constitute one ground among others
35 for a court to invalidate or enjoin an emergency order, or some of its applications, on the
36 basis that it is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling public health or safety purpose;
37 3. Requires the Governor to convene the Legislature if a declared state of emergency
38 is to be in effect for longer than 30 days. If the Legislature does not, by a 2/3 vote in each
39 House of the Legislature, vote to extend the state of emergency, the Governor may not
40 declare a similar, subsequent state of emergency;
41 4. Provides that the Governor may not reissue or renew an emergency proclamation
42 that is substantially similar to one that expired or reissue an emergency proclamation
43 terminated by the Legislature without approval of the Legislature; and

2 proclamation issued by the Governor.
