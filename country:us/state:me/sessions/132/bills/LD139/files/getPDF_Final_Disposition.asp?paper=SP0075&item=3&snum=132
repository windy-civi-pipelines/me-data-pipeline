Resolve, Directing the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to Study
Establishing a Program for the Electronic Tagging of Deer
Sec. 1. Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to study establishing
program for electronic tagging of deer. Resolved: That the Department of Inland
Fisheries and Wildlife shall study and establish a plan for the implementation of a program
for the electronic tagging of harvested deer. The department shall submit a report, including
suggested legislation, to the Joint Standing Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife no
later than January 14, 2026. The report must include information on the projected costs,
programming and staffing requirements of developing and implementing an electronic
tagging program and how the department would recoup lost money, if applicable. To the
extent practicable, the department shall consult with local business owners in the study who
contract as registered agents of the department for the tagging of deer to gauge how a
transition to an electronic tagging program may impact these agents, especially in more
rural areas of the State. The report must also include information related to anticipated
effects on biological data collection and relevant compliance and enforcement issues.
Finally, the report must outline a plan for program implementation, including suggested
time frames, and a plan for how the department would raise awareness of an electronic
tagging program across the State. The Joint Standing Committee on Inland Fisheries and
Wildlife may report out a bill based on the report to the Second Regular Session of the
132nd Legislature.
