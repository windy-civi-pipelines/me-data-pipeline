3 §1617. Stewardship program for electronic smoking devices
4 1. Definitions. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the
5 following terms have the following meanings.
6 A. "Brand" means a name, symbol, word or mark that identifies an electronic smoking
7 device, rather than its components, and attributes the device to the owner of the brand.
8 B. "Electronic smoking device" or "device" means any device that may be used to
9 deliver any aerosolized or vaporized substance to a person inhaling from the device,
10 including, but not limited to, an electronic cigarette, electronic cigar, electronic pipe,
11 so-called vape pen or electronic hookah. "Electronic smoking device" includes any
12 component, part or accessory of the device and any substance that may be aerosolized
13 or vaporized by that device, whether or not the substance contains nicotine. "Electronic
14 smoking device" does not include drugs, devices or combination products authorized
15 for sale by the United States Food and Drug Administration, as those terms are defined
16 in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
17 C. "Electronic smoking device stewardship organization" or "stewardship
18 organization" means a corporation, nonprofit organization or other legal entity created
19 by a producer or group of producers pursuant to this section to implement an electronic
20 smoking device stewardship program.
21 D. "Electronic smoking device stewardship plan" or "stewardship plan" means a plan
22 to establish an electronic smoking device stewardship program to be submitted to the
23 department for review pursuant to subsection 6.
24 E. "Electronic smoking device stewardship program" or "program" means the program
25 established under this section to provide for the collection, transportation, reuse and
26 recycling or disposal, or both, of unwanted electronic smoking devices.
27 F. "Producer" means a person that:
28 (1) Has legal ownership of the brand of an electronic smoking device sold in or
29 into the State;
30 (2) Imports an electronic smoking device branded by a person that meets the
31 requirements of paragraph A and has no physical presence in the United States; or
32 (3) Sells an electronic smoking device in the State at wholesale or retail, does not
33 have legal ownership of the brand of the device and elects to fulfill the
34 responsibilities of the producer for that device.
35 G. "Proprietary information" has the same meaning as in Title 38, section 1771,
36 subsection 6-A.
37 H. "Recycling" has the same meaning as in Title 38, section 1771, subsection 7.
38 I. "Reuse" has the same meaning as in Title 38, section 1771, subsection 8.
39 J. "Unwanted electronic smoking device" means an electronic smoking device that is
40 no longer wanted by its owner or that has been abandoned or discarded or is intended
41 to be discarded by its owner.

1 2. Program. Pursuant to this section, a producer that sells an electronic smoking
2 device in the State shall, individually, collectively or through a stewardship organization,
3 implement and finance an electronic smoking device stewardship program to manage, in
4 accordance with the priorities in section 2101, unwanted electronic smoking devices sold
5 by the producer at the end of the device's life.
6 A. The program must include a collection system for unwanted electronic smoking
7 devices that is convenient and adequate to serve the needs of persons in both rural and
8 urban areas. No later than one year following commencement of the collection of
9 electronic smoking devices by the program's collection system, the collection system
10 must include permanent collection locations located within 15 miles of 90% of the
11 residents of the State unless the department determines that the requirements of this
12 paragraph are not practicable due to geographical constraints or that an alternative
13 collection system that does not meet the requirements of this paragraph will result in
14 equivalent and more efficient collection.
15 B. The program must provide for effective education and outreach to promote the use
16 of the program and to ensure that collection options are understood by the public.
17 C. A producer or stewardship organization, including a producer's or stewardship
18 organization's officers, members, employees and agents that organize an electronic
19 device stewardship program under this section, is immune from liability for the
20 producer's or stewardship organization's conduct under state laws relating to antitrust,
21 restraint of trade, unfair trade practices and other regulation of trade or commerce only
22 to the extent necessary to plan and implement the producer's or stewardship
23 organization's chosen organized collection or recycling system.
24 D. The program must include at a minimum a half-time employee or contracted agent
25 whose job duties are dedicated to implementing the program in the State unless the
26 department determines that a lesser staffing requirement is adequate to provide the
27 administrative oversight, training and ongoing technical support to collection locations,
28 education and outreach efforts, program performance assessment and reporting
29 necessary for program implementation.
30 3. Requirement for sale. One hundred eighty days after a stewardship plan submitted
31 to the department pursuant to subsection 6 is approved by the department in accordance
32 with subsection 7, a producer may not sell or offer for sale in the State an electronic
33 smoking device unless the producer participates in an electronic smoking device
34 stewardship program under this section in accordance with an approved stewardship plan.
35 4. No fee. An electronic smoking device stewardship program may not charge a person
36 a fee at the time an unwanted electronic smoking device is delivered or collected for
37 recycling or disposal under the program.
38 5. Costs. Producers participating in an electronic smoking device stewardship
39 program shall finance the collection, transportation and reuse, recycling or disposition of
40 unwanted electronic smoking devices; effective education and outreach related to the
41 program; program assessment; program reporting; any incentives necessary to achieve
42 program goals; payment of reasonable fees to the department for review of the producers'
43 stewardship plan and any proposed amendments; and payment of annual fees to the
44 department to cover the department's actual costs for the program for annual report review,
45 oversight, administration and enforcement, which may not exceed $100,000 per year per
Page 2 - 132LR2253(01)

416 program and which must be properly documented and provided by the department to the
427 program prior to or at the time that such payment is required.
