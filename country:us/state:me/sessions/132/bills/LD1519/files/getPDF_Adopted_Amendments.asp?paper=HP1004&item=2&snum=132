14 following the date on which the stewardship plan for a program is approved by the
15 Department of Environmental Protection, all retailers in the State must participate in the
16 program as collection locations.
17 3. It requires an electronic smoking device stewardship program to provide a financial
18 incentive with a minimum value of $2 to a person for each unwanted electronic smoking
19 device returned by the person to a collection location, except that a person may not receive
20 a financial incentive for more than 2 devices returned to a collection location in a single

28 person may not dispose of an electronic smoking device except in accordance with an
