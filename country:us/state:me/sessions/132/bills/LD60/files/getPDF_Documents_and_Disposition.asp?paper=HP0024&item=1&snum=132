28 2. Request; duration; denial. An employee of an employer may submit a request in
29 writing, including by electronic means, for a flexible work schedule. The employer shall
30 consider the employee's request for a flexible work schedule and whether the request may
31 be granted in a manner that is not inconsistent with employer operations. The employer is
32 not required to grant a request by an employee. The employer shall inform the employee
33 in writing, including by electronic means, of the employer's decision regarding the
34 employee's request for a flexible work schedule. If the employer does not grant the request
35 of an employee, the employer shall specify in the decision to the employee the reason the

37 subsection 1, paragraph C. If the employer grants the request by the employee for a flexible

5 much notice as practicable to the employee, may rescind a flexible work schedule if the

7 4. Retaliation prohibited. An employer that takes action intended to prevent a person
8 from or penalize a person for exercising rights protected under this section is subject to a
9 civil penalty of not less than $100 and not more than $500 payable to the Department of
10 Labor. The penalty is recoverable in a civil action.

13 expansive than the rights established by this section.
