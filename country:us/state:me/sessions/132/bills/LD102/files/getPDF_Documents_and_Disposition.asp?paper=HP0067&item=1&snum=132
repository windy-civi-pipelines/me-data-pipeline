1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 15 MRSA §3010, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2023, c. 557, §1, is further
3 amended to read:
4 3. Juvenile history record information pertaining to adjudications; juveniles who
5 are wanted persons. Notwithstanding subsection 2, if a juvenile has been adjudicated as
6 having committed a juvenile crime that would constitute murder or a Class A, B or C crime
7 if the juvenile adjudicated were an adult, then that adjudication and any resulting
8 disposition imposed, but no other related juvenile history record information, may be
9 disclosed publicly, except as provided in this subsection. Any adjudication and related
10 disposition sealed pursuant to section 3308‑C, subsection 10 is not subject to public
11 disclosure pursuant to this subsection.
12 For the purpose of apprehending a juvenile, the juvenile’s name, date of birth, physical
13 description, photograph, location of alleged escape if applicable, any crime listed on an
14 arrest warrant if applicable and whether the juvenile may present a risk to public safety, but
15 no other information, may be disclosed publicly under the following circumstances:
16 A. If the head of a criminal justice agency that had official custody of the juvenile has
17 a reasonable belief that the juvenile has committed a juvenile crime that would
18 constitute escape as defined in Title 17-A, section 755, subsection 1 if the juvenile were
19 an adult or that would constitute escape from furlough or other rehabilitative program
20 as defined in Title 17-A, section 755, subsection 1-C if the juvenile were an adult;
21 B. If an officer who arrested the juvenile has a reasonable belief that the juvenile has
22 committed a juvenile crime that would constitute escape from arrest or escape during
23 transport following arrest as defined in Title 17-A, section 755, subsection 1-D if the
24 juvenile were an adult; or
25 C. If a warrant of arrest has been issued alleging that the juvenile has committed a
26 juvenile crime that would constitute murder or a Class A, B, C or D crime if the juvenile
27 were an adult.
28 The information used for the purpose of apprehending a juvenile in accordance with this
29 subsection may also be disclosed publicly if the juvenile had attained 18 years of age at the
30 time of an alleged escape as described in paragraphs A and B.
31 SUMMARY
3322 This bill allows criminal justice agencies to provide to the public certain juvenile
3333 history record information for the purpose of apprehending juveniles when either the
3344 juvenile has escaped from custody as defined by the Maine Criminal Code or a warrant of
3355 arrest has been issued alleging the juvenile has committed a juvenile crime that would
3366 constitute murder or a Class A, B, C or D crime if the juvenile were an adult.
37 The bill also allows the juvenile history record information to be shared if the juvenile
38 had attained 18 years of age at the time of the alleged escape.
