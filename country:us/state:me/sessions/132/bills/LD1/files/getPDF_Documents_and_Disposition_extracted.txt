Secretary of the Senate
Presented by President DAUGHTRY of Cumberland. (GOVERNOR'S BILL)
Cosponsored by Speaker FECTEAU of Biddeford and
Senator: STEWART of Aroostook, Representative: FAULKINGHAM of Winter Harbor.
Printed on recycled paper
1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the winter storms of December 18, 2023, January 9, 2024 and January 13,
4 2024 caused an estimated $90,000,000 of damage to public infrastructure and significant
5 additional damage to private property, including homes, wharves and businesses; and
6 Whereas, the damage demonstrates an urgent need for increased preparedness for
7 improved resiliency from future weather-related events; and
8 Whereas, the Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management, Maine
9 Emergency Management Agency has obligated the existing balance of the Disaster
10 Recovery Fund to fund the state match for funding for previously declared disasters and
11 requires additional funding to fully fund the state cost share for funding for current open
12 disasters; and
13 Whereas, the Maine Emergency Management Agency currently lacks the capacity to
14 apply for competitive hazard mitigation grant funds, improve much-needed statewide
15 emergency systems and provide matching funds needed for United States Department of
16 Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster and hazard
17 mitigation loan funds; and
18 Whereas, in its November report to the Governor, the State of Maine Infrastructure
19 Rebuilding and Resilience Commission recommended a set of immediate actions to
20 improve emergency communication, increase community resilience, prepare for future
21 weather-related events and increase public safety; and
22 Whereas, municipal leaders, regional planners, emergency managers and state
23 agencies lack up-to-date hydrological and sea level rise modeling data and are operating
24 with outdated Federal Emergency Management Agency maps; and
25 Whereas, only 1.3% of all homes and buildings in the State are covered under the
26 National Flood Insurance Program, a number that has declined while people in the State
27 who do have flood insurance are filing more claims; and
28 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
29 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
30 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
31 therefore,
32 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:

S.P. 29 In Senate, January 8, 2025
An Act to Increase Storm Preparedness for Maine's Communities,
Homes and Infrastructure
(EMERGENCY)
Reference to the Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs suggested and ordered
printed.
DAREK M. GRANT
Secretary of the Senate
Presented by President DAUGHTRY of Cumberland. (GOVERNOR'S BILL)
Cosponsored by Speaker FECTEAU of Biddeford and
Senator: STEWART of Aroostook, Representative: FAULKINGHAM of Winter Harbor.
Printed on recycled paper

1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the winter storms of December 18, 2023, January 9, 2024 and January 13,
4 2024 caused an estimated $90,000,000 of damage to public infrastructure and significant
5 additional damage to private property, including homes, wharves and businesses; and
6 Whereas, the damage demonstrates an urgent need for increased preparedness for
7 improved resiliency from future weather-related events; and
8 Whereas, the Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management, Maine
9 Emergency Management Agency has obligated the existing balance of the Disaster
10 Recovery Fund to fund the state match for funding for previously declared disasters and
11 requires additional funding to fully fund the state cost share for funding for current open
12 disasters; and
13 Whereas, the Maine Emergency Management Agency currently lacks the capacity to
14 apply for competitive hazard mitigation grant funds, improve much-needed statewide
15 emergency systems and provide matching funds needed for United States Department of
16 Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster and hazard
17 mitigation loan funds; and
18 Whereas, in its November report to the Governor, the State of Maine Infrastructure
19 Rebuilding and Resilience Commission recommended a set of immediate actions to
20 improve emergency communication, increase community resilience, prepare for future
21 weather-related events and increase public safety; and
22 Whereas, municipal leaders, regional planners, emergency managers and state
23 agencies lack up-to-date hydrological and sea level rise modeling data and are operating
24 with outdated Federal Emergency Management Agency maps; and
25 Whereas, only 1.3% of all homes and buildings in the State are covered under the
26 National Flood Insurance Program, a number that has declined while people in the State
27 who do have flood insurance are filing more claims; and
28 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
29 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
30 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
31 therefore,
32 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
