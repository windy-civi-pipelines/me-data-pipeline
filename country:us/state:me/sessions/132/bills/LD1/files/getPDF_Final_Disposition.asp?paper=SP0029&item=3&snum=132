and Infrastructure
Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, the winter storms of December 18, 2023, January 9, 2024 and January 13,
2024 caused an estimated $90,000,000 of damage to public infrastructure and significant
additional damage to private property, including homes, wharves and businesses; and
Whereas, the damage demonstrates an urgent need for increased preparedness for
improved resiliency from future extreme weather events; and
Whereas, the Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management, Maine
Emergency Management Agency has obligated the existing balance of the Disaster
Recovery Fund to fund the state match for funding for previously declared disasters and
requires additional funding to fully fund the state cost share for funding for current open
disasters; and
Whereas, the Maine Emergency Management Agency currently lacks the capacity to
apply for competitive hazard mitigation grant funds, improve much-needed statewide
emergency systems and provide matching funds needed for United States Department of
Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster and hazard
mitigation loan funds; and
Whereas, in its November report to the Governor, the State of Maine Infrastructure
Rebuilding and Resilience Commission recommended a set of immediate actions to
improve emergency communication, increase community resilience, prepare for future
extreme weather events and increase public safety; and
Whereas, county, municipal and tribal leaders, regional planners, state agencies and
emergency managers at the state, county and local level lack up-to-date hydrological and
sea level rise modeling data and are operating with outdated Federal Emergency
Management Agency maps; and
Page 1 - 132LR0939(03)
Whereas, only 1.3% of all homes and buildings in the State are covered under the
National Flood Insurance Program, a number that has declined while people in the State
who do have flood insurance are filing more claims; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore,
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:

APPROVED CHAPTER
APRIL 22, 2025 33
BY GOVERNOR PUBLIC LAW
STATE OF MAINE
_____
IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD
TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE
_____
S.P. 29 - L.D. 1
An Act to Increase Storm Preparedness for Maine's Communities, Homes
and Infrastructure
Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, the winter storms of December 18, 2023, January 9, 2024 and January 13,
2024 caused an estimated $90,000,000 of damage to public infrastructure and significant
additional damage to private property, including homes, wharves and businesses; and
Whereas, the damage demonstrates an urgent need for increased preparedness for
improved resiliency from future extreme weather events; and
Whereas, the Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management, Maine
Emergency Management Agency has obligated the existing balance of the Disaster
Recovery Fund to fund the state match for funding for previously declared disasters and
requires additional funding to fully fund the state cost share for funding for current open
disasters; and
Whereas, the Maine Emergency Management Agency currently lacks the capacity to
apply for competitive hazard mitigation grant funds, improve much-needed statewide
emergency systems and provide matching funds needed for United States Department of
Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster and hazard
mitigation loan funds; and
Whereas, in its November report to the Governor, the State of Maine Infrastructure
Rebuilding and Resilience Commission recommended a set of immediate actions to
improve emergency communication, increase community resilience, prepare for future
extreme weather events and increase public safety; and
Whereas, county, municipal and tribal leaders, regional planners, state agencies and
emergency managers at the state, county and local level lack up-to-date hydrological and
sea level rise modeling data and are operating with outdated Federal Emergency
Management Agency maps; and
Page 1 - 132LR0939(03)

Whereas, only 1.3% of all homes and buildings in the State are covered under the
National Flood Insurance Program, a number that has declined while people in the State
who do have flood insurance are filing more claims; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore,
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
