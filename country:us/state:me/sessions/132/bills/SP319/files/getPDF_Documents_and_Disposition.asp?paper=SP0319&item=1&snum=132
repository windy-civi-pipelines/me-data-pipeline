OF THE MARCH FROM SELMA TO MONTGOMERY

WHEREAS, on March 7, 1965 approximately 600 civil rights marchers, led by John Lewis

Leadership Conference, headed east out of Selma, Alabama to the State Capitol in
Montgomery, Alabama; and

nonviolent protest of reportedly as many as 2,500 people before turning around after crossing
the Edmund Pettus Bridge due to a barricade of state troopers; and
WHEREAS, on March 15, 1965, despite pressure from political figures, United States

march from Selma to Montgomery to proceed, overturning Governor George Wallace's
prohibition of the protest; and

Alabama National Guard under federal command, the FBI and federal marshals, more than
3,000 people, led by Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., set out from Selma to Montgomery, a
54-mile journey, marching an average of 10 miles a day along Route 80 and sleeping in fields;
and
