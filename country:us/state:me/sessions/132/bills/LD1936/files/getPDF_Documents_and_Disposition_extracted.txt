10 billing agreement with the transmission and distribution utility for the distributed
11 generation resource, with some exceptions.

13 and not more than 2 megawatts that receives a good-cause exemption from the Public
14 Utilities Commission must reach commercial operation by December 31, 2025 to
15 participate in the kilowatt-hour credit net energy billing program and the tariff rate net
16 energy billing program.
17 3. It creates a limited exception from the kilowatt-hour credit net energy billing
18 program limitations to allow a distributed generation resource with a nameplate capacity
19 of one megawatt or less to participate in net energy billing if the distributed generation
20 resource is wholly owned by the customers receiving the net energy billing credits
21 associated with the output of the distributed generation resource.
22 4. It allows a distributed generation resource to be used in the kilowatt-hour credit net
23 energy billing program if the distributed generation resource is owned by the customer and
24 is used to serve the electric load of that customer only and 100% of the net energy billing
25 credits associated with the distributed generation resource are allocated to the retail account
26 of that customer.
27 5. It directs the commission, starting January 1, 2026, to establish by routine technical
28 rule the compensation rates applicable to all customers participating in net energy billing
29 with distributed generation resources owned by nonresident program owners.
30 6. It requires a transmission and distribution utility, if a customer with a shared
31 financial interest in the resource terminates the customer's participation in the net energy
32 billing arrangement, to replace that customer by enrolling a customer receiving low-income
33 assistance under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3214, subsection 2 who is
34 located in the same transmission and distribution utility service territory as the terminated
35 customer.
36 7. Starting January 1, 2026, it establishes that the tariff rate set by the commission by
37 rule for a customer participating in the tariff rate net energy billing program with a
38 distributed generation resource not owned by a nonresident program owner must equal 9.5¢
39 and increase by 2.25% on January 1st of each subsequent year. If the tariff rate established
40 would cause a project that has reached commercial operation by January 1, 2026 to no
