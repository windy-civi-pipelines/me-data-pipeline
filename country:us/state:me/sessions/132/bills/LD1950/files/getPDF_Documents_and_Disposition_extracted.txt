31 prior to the commitment by the jail authority, or either county on behalf of the jail authority,
32 to issue any instrument of indebtedness, including, but not limited to, bonds and notes. The
33 date upon which the jail authority or either county is committed to issue the debt is
34 established by a majority vote of the board of directors at least 90 days in advance of that
35 date. At the time of withdrawal, the withdrawing county remains liable for its proportionate
36 share of jail authority debts and withdrawal expenses incurred prior to the date of
37 withdrawal and shall make provisions satisfactory to the board of directors and the
38 commissioners to pay its share of the debt outstanding at the time of withdrawal.

Page 2 - 132LR1609(01)
414 authority pursuant to section 1859, may withdraw from the jail authority while the
425 indebtedness remains outstanding without the approval of 2/3 of the board of directors and

570 withdrawing county after consent of each other county, if full faith and credit has not
581 already been pledged under section 1954 or 1955. Withdrawal must be permissible in
592 existing debt instruments.
10 In considering the request of a county to withdraw, the board of directors and the
11 commissioners shall consider the effect of the proposed withdrawal on the ability of the jail
12 authority to continue operating the multicounty jail in a manner and at a cost to the
13 remaining county counties that is reasonable.
14 If the withdrawal causes the costs of the other county counties to increase as a condition
15 of withdrawal, the withdrawing county may be required by the board of directors and the
16 commissioners either to secure an alternate and equivalent source of prisoners for the
17 reasonable life of the jail facility or to execute an agreement to make payments to the jail
18 authority following withdrawal that maintains the costs of the other county member
19 counties to remain constant when adjusted annually for the effect of all other factors on the
20 costs until an alternate and equivalent source of prisoners is secured or results from the
21 nonwithdrawing county's counties' population.
22 Subject to any required approval by the board of directors and the commissioners of
23 each county, withdrawal from the authority by a county may be accomplished by a vote of
24 the commissioners.

30 such a recommendation is made, the commissioners in each county shall vote on the
31 question of dissolving the jail authority. If the commissioners in each of the counties
32 county vote to dissolve the jail authority, the jail authority must be dissolved by the board
33 of directors at a time fixed by the board of directors.
34 Sec. 13. 30-A MRSA §1859 is enacted to read:
35 §1859. Addition of counties
36 After the initial formation of the jail authority pursuant to section 1851, the jail
37 authority may permit additional counties to join the authority. Counties that wish to apply
38 to join the jail authority membership shall hold a public hearing within that county in the
39 same manner as provided in section 1851, subsection 2. If, after the public hearing, the
40 commissioners of the applying county wish to join the jail authority, they shall call an
41 organizational meeting within that county, which must be held in the same manner as in
42 section 1851, subsection 3. A majority of the commissioners from the applying county
43 shall attend the organizational meeting, and the vote to join the jail authority requires a
44 majority vote of those commissioners.

21 the Maine Municipal Bond Bank. A county issuing bonds under this section and the jail

34 section 1859. After reviewing the report, the committee may report out related legislation
35 to the Second Regular Session of the 132nd Legislature.
36 SUMMARY
3377 This bill permits the multicounty jail authority to add additional counties to the jail
3388 authority. A county that wishes to join the jail authority must hold a public hearing on the
3399 matter. If the commissioners of the county wish to join the jail authority, they are required
4400 to hold an organizational meeting and vote on whether to apply to join the jail authority.
4411 This vote requires a majority of the county's commissioners. The jail authority may then
4422 consider the applying county's application, and hold a vote on whether to accept the county
4433 into the jail authority. This vote requires a majority of the authority's directors.
Page 6 - 132LR1609(01)
1 The bill also changes most references to Lincoln County and Sagadahoc County to
2 member counties to be consistent with the potential addition of more counties to the jail
3 authority.

23 commissioners and one sheriff. A quorum of the directors may conduct the affairs of the
24 jail authority even if there is a vacancy on the board of directors. A quorum is a simple
25 majority of eligible and appointed directors, as long as each county is represented. A simple
26 majority of directors voting, either in person or by written consent, may conduct the affairs
27 of the jail authority.
28 Sec. 11. 30-A MRSA §1857, as enacted by PL 2003, c. 228, §1, is amended to read:
29 §1857. Withdrawal of counties
30 Lincoln County or Sagadahoc County may withdraw from the jail authority at any time
31 prior to the commitment by the jail authority, or either county on behalf of the jail authority,
32 to issue any instrument of indebtedness, including, but not limited to, bonds and notes. The
33 date upon which the jail authority or either county is committed to issue the debt is
34 established by a majority vote of the board of directors at least 90 days in advance of that
35 date. At the time of withdrawal, the withdrawing county remains liable for its proportionate
36 share of jail authority debts and withdrawal expenses incurred prior to the date of
37 withdrawal and shall make provisions satisfactory to the board of directors and the
38 commissioners to pay its share of the debt outstanding at the time of withdrawal.
39 If a county withdraws from the jail authority or if the jail authority is dissolved, all of
40 the responsibilities granted to the jail administrator are assumed by the sheriffs of the
41 respective counties.
42 After issuance of instruments of indebtedness with a maturity of one year or more,
43 neither Lincoln County nor Sagadahoc County, nor any other county that has joined the
Page 2 - 132LR1609(01)

414 authority pursuant to section 1859, may withdraw from the jail authority while the
425 indebtedness remains outstanding without the approval of 2/3 of the board of directors and
436 a majority vote of the commissioners from each other county. A withdrawing county shall
447 make provisions satisfactory to 2/3 of the board of directors and a majority of the
458 commissioners from each county to pay its share of debt outstanding at the time of
469 withdrawal. Those provisions must include the pledge of the full faith and credit of the
570 withdrawing county after consent of each other county, if full faith and credit has not
581 already been pledged under section 1954 or 1955. Withdrawal must be permissible in
592 existing debt instruments.
10 In considering the request of a county to withdraw, the board of directors and the
11 commissioners shall consider the effect of the proposed withdrawal on the ability of the jail
12 authority to continue operating the multicounty jail in a manner and at a cost to the
13 remaining county counties that is reasonable.
14 If the withdrawal causes the costs of the other county counties to increase as a condition
15 of withdrawal, the withdrawing county may be required by the board of directors and the
16 commissioners either to secure an alternate and equivalent source of prisoners for the
17 reasonable life of the jail facility or to execute an agreement to make payments to the jail
18 authority following withdrawal that maintains the costs of the other county member
19 counties to remain constant when adjusted annually for the effect of all other factors on the
20 costs until an alternate and equivalent source of prisoners is secured or results from the
21 nonwithdrawing county's counties' population.
22 Subject to any required approval by the board of directors and the commissioners of
23 each county, withdrawal from the authority by a county may be accomplished by a vote of
24 the commissioners.
25 Sec. 12. 30-A MRSA §1858, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2003, c. 228, §1, is amended
26 to read:
27 1. Method. In the event both all counties vote to withdraw pursuant to section 1857,
28 the board of directors shall vote to dissolve the jail authority. The board of directors may,
29 at any time by 2/3 vote, recommend to the counties that the jail authority be dissolved. If
30 such a recommendation is made, the commissioners in each county shall vote on the
31 question of dissolving the jail authority. If the commissioners in each of the counties
32 county vote to dissolve the jail authority, the jail authority must be dissolved by the board
33 of directors at a time fixed by the board of directors.
34 Sec. 13. 30-A MRSA §1859 is enacted to read:
35 §1859. Addition of counties

37 authority may permit additional counties to join the authority. Counties that wish to apply
38 to join the jail authority membership shall hold a public hearing within that county in the
39 same manner as provided in section 1851, subsection 2. If, after the public hearing, the
40 commissioners of the applying county wish to join the jail authority, they shall call an
41 organizational meeting within that county, which must be held in the same manner as in
42 section 1851, subsection 3. A majority of the commissioners from the applying county
43 shall attend the organizational meeting, and the vote to join the jail authority requires a
44 majority vote of those commissioners.

36 SUMMARY
3377 This bill permits the multicounty jail authority to add additional counties to the jail
3388 authority. A county that wishes to join the jail authority must hold a public hearing on the
3399 matter. If the commissioners of the county wish to join the jail authority, they are required
4400 to hold an organizational meeting and vote on whether to apply to join the jail authority.
4411 This vote requires a majority of the county's commissioners. The jail authority may then
4422 consider the applying county's application, and hold a vote on whether to accept the county
4433 into the jail authority. This vote requires a majority of the authority's directors.

1 The bill also changes most references to Lincoln County and Sagadahoc County to
2 member counties to be consistent with the potential addition of more counties to the jail
3 authority.
