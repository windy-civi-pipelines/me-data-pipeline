10 liquidated damages from the fund be limited to those cases when the employer has
11 terminated the employer's business and there are no assets of the employer from which
12 earned wages may be paid or when the employer has filed under any provision of the
13 Federal Bankruptcy Act. An officer or director in the case of a corporation, partner in the
14 case of a partnership or owner in the case of a sole proprietorship may not be considered
15 an employee for purposes of this section.
16 2. Administration. The fund shall must be administered by the Director of the Bureau
17 of Labor Standards. Applications for payment from the fund and disbursements from the
18 fund shall must be in accordance with regulations promulgated rules adopted by the
19 director. The State shall must be subrogated to any claims against an employer for unpaid
20 wages and liquidated damages, in an amount equal to the wages, by an employee who has
21 received payment from the fund. Subrogation to these claims shall must be to the extent of
22 payment from the fund to the employee.
23 3. Amount in fund. The Maine Wage Assurance Fund is a nonlapsing, revolving
24 fund limited to a maximum of $200,000. All money collected from an employer pursuant
25 to a claim for unpaid wages and liquidated damages, in an amount equal to the wages, by
26 an employee who has received payment from the fund, or by the State as the employee's
27 subrogee, is credited to the fund.
28 The fund must be established and augmented periodically as necessary.
29 Money in the fund not needed currently to meet claims against the fund must be deposited
30 with the Treasurer of State to be credited to the fund and may be invested in such manner
31 as is provided for by statute. Interest received on that investment must be credited to the
32 Maine Wage Assurance Fund.
33 SUMMARY
3344 This bill amends the laws governing the Maine Wage Assurance Fund to increase the
3355 number of weeks for which payment may be made from 2 to 4. It also includes an equal
3366 amount of liquidated damages payable to the employee.
