10 from immature cannabis plant to the point of retail sale, return, disposal or destruction. The
11 tracking system must allow for cannabis plants at the stage of cultivation and upon transfer
12 from the stage of cultivation to another registrant to be tracked by group. The department
13 may implement a tracking system that allows cannabis or cannabis products to be tracked
14 by group.
15 The department shall ensure that the system implemented and administered under this
16 section, whether tracking individually or by group, maintains a detailed record at every

23 determined by the department.
24 2. Group tracking. Cannabis plants at the same stage of growth that are of the same
25 varietal or cultivar of the plant genus Cannabis may be tracked by group if they:
26 A. Are planted in the same specific area at the same time;
27 B. Are transplanted to the same specific area at the same time; or
28 C. Include cannabis plants that were planted in a specific area and cannabis plants that
29 were transplanted to the same specific area.

32 may not be tracked as a group unless they are intended for harvest as a group.
33 3. Tagging. A registrant shall affix a tag containing the identifying information
34 required by the department by rule to each group of cannabis plants tracked under this
35 section. The department may not require cannabis plants that are being tracked as a group

38 transferred to another registrant, the registrant transferring the group of cannabis plants
39 must provide a manifest that lists every cannabis plant within the group and any other
40 relevant information required by the department by rule.

16 edible cannabis product is impracticable, each individual serving size of the product
17 must be packaged together with the universal symbol affixed to the individual
18 packaging. For purposes of this chapter, edible cannabis products that are determined

11 tracking system must allow for cannabis plants at the stage of cultivation and upon transfer
12 from the stage of cultivation to another registrant to be tracked by group. The department
13 may implement a tracking system that allows cannabis or cannabis products to be tracked
14 by group.
15 The department shall ensure that the system implemented and administered under this
16 section, whether tracking individually or by group, maintains a detailed record at every

27 B. Are transplanted to the same specific area at the same time; or
28 C. Include cannabis plants that were planted in a specific area and cannabis plants that
29 were transplanted to the same specific area.

37 4. Group transfers. When a group of cannabis plants tracked under this section is
38 transferred to another registrant, the registrant transferring the group of cannabis plants
39 must provide a manifest that lists every cannabis plant within the group and any other
40 relevant information required by the department by rule.
Page 5 - 132LR0854(01)

14 clearly included on the wrapping or packaging. If the office determines by rule that
15 stamping, embossing, individual wrapping or blister packaging for a particular type of
16 edible cannabis product is impracticable, each individual serving size of the product
17 must be packaged together with the universal symbol affixed to the individual
18 packaging. For purposes of this chapter, edible cannabis products that are determined
19 to be impracticable to stamp, emboss, individually wrap or blister package include but
20 are not limited to:
21 (1) Potato or corn chips;
22 (2) Popcorn;
23 (3) Pretzels; and

28 Sec. 14. 28-B MRSA §1101, sub-§2, as corrected by RR 2023, c. 2, Pt. A, §§44

36 office, another state agency or department or any other public or private entity and
37 relating to the sale and use of cannabis and cannabis products under Title 22, chapter
38 558-C. The office may give priority consideration to funding public health and safety
39 awareness and education programs, initiatives and campaigns designed specifically for
40 minors.
41 B. Money credited to the fund may be expended by the office to fund enhanced law
42 enforcement training programs relating to the sale and use of adult use cannabis and

435 Academy, another state agency or department or any other public or private entity.
4 C. Money credited to the fund may be expended by the office to provide
5 reimbursement to a municipality for qualifying expenses incurred as a result of the
6 municipality's opting to permit the operation of some or all adult use cannabis
7 establishments within the municipality. For the purposes of this paragraph, "qualifying
8 expenses" means legal fees and costs associated with the drafting and adoption of a
9 warrant article or the adoption or amendment of an ordinance, including the conduct
10 of a town meeting or election, by a municipality that opted to permit the operation of
11 some or all cannabis establishments within the municipality. Each municipality may
12 receive funds, not to exceed $20,000, only once for the reimbursement of qualifying
13 expenses in accordance with this paragraph. Nothing in this paragraph may be
14 construed to require the office to reimburse qualifying expenses incurred by a
15 municipality if the office determines there are insufficient funds available to provide
16 reimbursement. Under no circumstances may a municipality submit an initial
17 application for the reimbursement of qualifying expenses more than 3 years after the
18 municipality adopts a warrant article or adopts or amends an ordinance to allow for the
19 operation of some or all adult use cannabis establishments within the municipality. The
20 office may adopt rules to implement and administer the reimbursement of qualifying
21 expenses to municipalities. Rules adopted pursuant to this paragraph are routine
22 technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A. The office may not
23 reimburse qualifying expenses under this paragraph accrued after July 1, 2027.
24 C-1. Money credited to the fund must be expended to provide a transfer of $2,000,000
25 by July 31st annually to the Recovery Community Centers Fund established pursuant

30 the department to other state agencies to fund the social equity program established in
31 Title 5, chapter 395.

33 paragraphs A to C-2 must be used to fund:
34 (1) The cost of the tax deductions for business expenses related to carrying on a
35 business as a cannabis establishment or a testing facility provided pursuant to Title
36 36, section 5122, subsection 2, paragraph PP and Title 36, section 5200‑A,
37 subsection 2, paragraph BB. By June 1st annually, the State Tax Assessor shall
