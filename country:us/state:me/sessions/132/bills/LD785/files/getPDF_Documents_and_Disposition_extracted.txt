20 §6202. Legislative findings and declaration of policy
21 The Legislature finds and declares the following.
22 The Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet
23 Indians are asserting asserted claims for possession of large areas of land in the State and
24 for damages alleging that the lands in question originally were transferred by treaty or
25 otherwise taken in violation of the Indian Trade and Intercourse Act of 1790, 1 Stat. 137,
26 or subsequent reenactments or versions thereof.
27 Substantial At the time, the prospect that these claims would not be promptly resolved
28 threatened to create substantial economic and social hardship could be created for large
29 numbers of landowners, citizens and communities in the State, and therefore to the State as
30 a whole, if these claims are not resolved promptly.
31 The claims also have produced disagreement between the Indian claimants and the
32 State over the extent of the state's State's jurisdiction in the claimed areas. This
33 disagreement has resulted in litigation and, if the claims are had not been resolved, further
34 litigation on jurisdictional issues would be have been likely.
35 The In the late 1970s, the Indian claimants and the State, acting through the Attorney
36 General, have reached certain agreements which represent that represented a good faith
37 effort on the part of all parties to achieve a fair and just resolution of those claims which
38 that, in the absence of agreement, would be have been pursued through the courts for many
39 years to the ultimate detriment of the State and all its citizens, including the Indians. The
40 resolution reached among the Indian claimants and the State affirmed the land transfers and
41 the reservations of rights embodied within the specific treaties that gave rise to the claims
Page 1 - 132LR0235(01)
412 at issue and sought to definitively eliminate any prospect that the claims brought by the
423 Indian claimants would cloud private title to land in the State.
3 The foregoing agreement between the Indian claimants and the State also represents a
4 good faith effort by the Indian claimants and the State to achieve a just and fair resolution
5 of their disagreement over jurisdiction on the present Passamaquoddy and Penobscot Indian
6 reservations and in the claimed areas. To that end, the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the
7 Penobscot Nation have agreed to adopt the laws of the State as their own to the extent
8 provided in this Act. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and its lands will be wholly
9 subject to the laws of the State.
10 It is the purpose of this Act to implement in part the foregoing agreement.
11 1. Rights, privileges, powers, duties and immunities. The purpose of the
12 amendments to this Act enacted in 2025 is to establish that the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the
13 Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians enjoy rights, privileges,
14 powers, duties and immunities similar to those of other federally recognized Indian tribes
15 within the United States.
16 2. Federal Indian law applies. Except as otherwise specified in this Act, the State,
17 the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians
18 agree and intend pursuant to United States Public Law 96-420 to recognize and adopt the
19 application of federal Indian law with regard to the rights, privileges, powers, duties and
20 immunities of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of
21 Maliseet Indians and their tribal members and land or other natural resources, including
22 laws, regulations and common law of the United States enacted for the benefit of Indians,
23 Indian nations or tribes or bands of Indians and laws, regulations and common law that

19 through their respective designees, must collaborate on an alternative dispute resolution
20 process to resolve tribal-state disputes, to be known as "the ADR work group." The Maine

7 SUMMARY
88 This bill implements several of the consensus recommendations of the Task Force on
99 Changes to the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Implementing Act governing the
1100 relationship between the State and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, the
1111 Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation. The January 14, 2020 report of the Task
1122 Force on Changes to the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Implementing Act is available
1133 online at http://legislature.maine.gov/maine-indian-claims-tf.
14 The bill makes substantial changes to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 30, chapter
15 601, currently known as "AN ACT to Implement the Maine Indian Claims Settlement,"
16 including by renaming the chapter "the Maine Implementing Act." The bill is designed to
17 restore to the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of
18 Maliseet Indians many of the rights to self-determination enjoyed by other federally
19 recognized Indian tribes within the United States. To carry out this purpose, the bill repeals
20 or amends many provisions of the Maine Implementing Act to recognize that federal Indian
21 law governs the rights, privileges, powers, duties and immunities of the tribe, nation and
22 band. "Federal Indian law" is defined to mean the United States Constitution and all
23 generally applicable federal statutes and regulations as well as common law and case law
24 interpreting, implementing, applying or enforcing those constitutional, statutory and
25 regulatory provisions relating to the rights, status, privileges, powers, duties and
26 immunities of federally recognized Indian tribes and their members and land or other
27 natural resources within the United States.
28 With respect to tribal land acquisition, the bill:
29 1. Repeals the definition of "Houlton Band Jurisdiction Land" enacted in Public Law
30 2023, chapter 369 and instead recognizes that the rights, privileges, powers, duties and
31 immunities of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians recognized in the Maine Implementing
32 Act apply to "Houlton Band Trust Land," which is defined to include all land and natural
33 resources acquired by the United States Secretary of the Interior in trust for the band under
34 the federal Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians Supplementary Claims Settlement Act of
35 1986 or any other applicable federal law, including the federal Indian Reorganization Act;
36 2. Amends the provisions describing Passamaquoddy Indian territory and Penobscot
37 Indian territory, the lands over which the tribe and the nation have the rights, privileges,
38 powers, duties and immunities of federally recognized Indian tribes under the Maine
39 Implementing Act. The bill restructures the procedures for land acquired by the United
40 States Secretary of the Interior in trust for the tribe or the nation to be considered Indian
41 territory. Instead of limiting trust land acquisition to specifically described parcels of land,
42 the bill recognizes as Indian territory any land acquired by the secretary in trust for the tribe
43 or nation within specific counties of the State either prior to the effective date of this
44 legislation or after the effective date of this legislation if the land is not located within the
45 borders of a city, town, village or plantation. If trust land within the specified counties is
Page 23 - 132LR0235(01)
416 acquired after the effective date of this legislation and is located within the borders of a
427 city, town, village or plantation, it may be considered Indian territory if the tribe or nation
438 enters into an agreement with the local government addressing payments in lieu of taxes,
449 allocation of law enforcement responsibility and land use. Lands acquired in trust for the
550 tribe or the nation under any applicable federal law, including the federal Indian
561 Reorganization Act, are also considered Indian territory;
7 3. Includes within Passamaquoddy Indian territory all lands owned in fee simple by
8 the Passamaquoddy Tribe on the effective date of this legislation if those lands are located
9 within specific counties and are subsequently acquired by the United States Secretary of
10 the Interior in trust for the Passamaquoddy Tribe; and
11 4. Repeals the provisions of the Maine Implementing Act regarding the takings of
12 tribal lands for public use.
13 The bill provides that the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton
14 Band of Maliseet Indians, as well as their officers and employees, are immune from suit to
15 the same extent as other federally recognized Indian tribes and their officers and employees
16 under federal Indian law.
17 With respect to the regulation of natural resources, the bill:
18 1. Recognizes the exclusive authority of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot
19 Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians to regulate fishing, hunting, trapping and
20 other taking of wildlife by both tribal and nontribal citizens within their respective Indian
21 territories and trust land;
22 2. Retains the authority of the Maine Indian Tribal-State Commission under current
23 law to regulate fishing on boundary waters; and
24 3. Authorizes the State, solely for conservation purposes, to regulate tribal members
25 engaged in fishing, hunting, trapping and other taking of wildlife off Indian territory or
26 trust land to the extent permitted under federal Indian law and consistent with reserved
27 tribal treaty rights.
28 The bill combines within one section of the Maine Implementing Act the authority of
29 law enforcement officers appointed by the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, the
30 Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation to enforce laws within their respective
31 Indian territories and trust land. The bill recognizes that law enforcement officers
32 appointed by the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation have exclusive authority
33 to enforce within their respective Indian territories, and law enforcement officers appointed
34 by the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians have exclusive authority to enforce within
35 Houlton Band Trust Land, the criminal and juvenile laws over which their respective tribal
36 courts have exclusive jurisdiction.
37 The bill also recognizes the authority of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians to create
38 a tribal school committee analogous to the authority of the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the
39 Penobscot Nation to create tribal school committees under current law.
40 With respect to civil jurisdiction, the bill:
41 1. Recognizes the exclusive authority, under federal Indian law, of the Houlton Band
42 of Maliseet Indians, the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation to exercise civil
Page 24 - 132LR0235(01)
413 regulatory authority on their respective Indian territory or trust land over their respective
424 tribal members and tribal entities;
3 2. Recognizes the concurrent authority with the State, under federal Indian law, of the
4 Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation to
5 exercise civil regulatory authority on their respective Indian territory or trust land over
6 persons and entities who are not tribal citizens or tribal entities; and
7 3. Recognizes and adopts the application of federal Indian law with respect to the
8 authority of the State and of the tribal courts of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, the
9 Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation to exercise adjudicatory jurisdiction over
10 civil actions arising on the band's, tribe's or nation's respective Indian territory or trust land.
11 The bill also requires the development of a dispute resolution process to facilitate
12 resolution of disputes between the State and tribes.
13 The bill explicitly provides that, for purposes of the federal Maine Indian Claims
14 Settlement Act of 1980, Public Law 96-420, except for any provision of federal Indian law
15 that conflicts with the Maine Implementing Act's allocation between the State and the tribes
16 of jurisdiction over crimes and juvenile crimes, the provisions of any federal law enacted
17 before, on or after October 10, 1980, that accords a special status or right to or relates to a
18 special status or right of any Indian, Indian nation, tribe or band of Indians, Indian lands,
19 Indian reservations, Indian country, Indian territory or land held in trust for Indians applies
20 to the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians
21 and their members and tribal lands. However, the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot
22 Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians may conduct gaming activities only in
23 accordance with state law and not under the authority of the federal Indian Gaming
24 Regulatory Act or its implementing regulations.
25 Finally, the bill either repeals or repeals and replaces each provision of the Maine
26 Implementing Act that was enacted by Public Law 1981, chapter 675 and provides that, if
27 the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians certifies its agreement to the provisions of this
28 legislation, that agreement constitutes a jurisdictional agreement between the State and the
29 Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians for purposes of the federal Maine Indian Claims
30 Settlement Act of 1980, Public Law 96-420, Section 6(e)(2) but does not constitute an
31 agreement by the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians that the provisions of Public Law 1981,
32 chapter 675 ever took effect.
33 The provisions of this bill take effect 150 days after adjournment of the First Regular
34 Session of the 132nd Legislature only if the relevant officials of the Passamaquoddy Tribe,
35 the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians certify the tribe's, nation's
36 and band's agreements to the legislation within 120 days after adjournment of the First
37 Regular Session of the 132nd Legislature.

8 Title 30, section 6205, subsection 1, Penobscot Indian territory, as defined in Title 30,

14 Sec. 3. 30 MRSA §6201, first ¶, as enacted by PL 1979, c. 732, §§1 and 31, is
15 amended to read:
16 This Act shall may be known and may be cited as "AN ACT to Implement the Maine
17 Indian Claims Settlement" or "the Maine Implementing Act."
18 Sec. 4. 30 MRSA §6202, as enacted by PL 1979, c. 732, §§1 and 31, is amended to
19 read:
20 §6202. Legislative findings and declaration of policy
21 The Legislature finds and declares the following.
22 The Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet
23 Indians are asserting asserted claims for possession of large areas of land in the State and
24 for damages alleging that the lands in question originally were transferred by treaty or
25 otherwise taken in violation of the Indian Trade and Intercourse Act of 1790, 1 Stat. 137,
26 or subsequent reenactments or versions thereof.
27 Substantial At the time, the prospect that these claims would not be promptly resolved
28 threatened to create substantial economic and social hardship could be created for large
29 numbers of landowners, citizens and communities in the State, and therefore to the State as
30 a whole, if these claims are not resolved promptly.
31 The claims also have produced disagreement between the Indian claimants and the
32 State over the extent of the state's State's jurisdiction in the claimed areas. This
33 disagreement has resulted in litigation and, if the claims are had not been resolved, further
34 litigation on jurisdictional issues would be have been likely.
35 The In the late 1970s, the Indian claimants and the State, acting through the Attorney
36 General, have reached certain agreements which represent that represented a good faith
37 effort on the part of all parties to achieve a fair and just resolution of those claims which
38 that, in the absence of agreement, would be have been pursued through the courts for many
39 years to the ultimate detriment of the State and all its citizens, including the Indians. The
40 resolution reached among the Indian claimants and the State affirmed the land transfers and
41 the reservations of rights embodied within the specific treaties that gave rise to the claims
Page 1 - 132LR0235(01)

412 at issue and sought to definitively eliminate any prospect that the claims brought by the
423 Indian claimants would cloud private title to land in the State.
3 The foregoing agreement between the Indian claimants and the State also represents a
4 good faith effort by the Indian claimants and the State to achieve a just and fair resolution
5 of their disagreement over jurisdiction on the present Passamaquoddy and Penobscot Indian
6 reservations and in the claimed areas. To that end, the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the
7 Penobscot Nation have agreed to adopt the laws of the State as their own to the extent
8 provided in this Act. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and its lands will be wholly
9 subject to the laws of the State.
10 It is the purpose of this Act to implement in part the foregoing agreement.
11 1. Rights, privileges, powers, duties and immunities. The purpose of the
12 amendments to this Act enacted in 2025 is to establish that the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the
13 Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians enjoy rights, privileges,
14 powers, duties and immunities similar to those of other federally recognized Indian tribes
15 within the United States.
16 2. Federal Indian law applies. Except as otherwise specified in this Act, the State,
17 the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians
18 agree and intend pursuant to United States Public Law 96-420 to recognize and adopt the
19 application of federal Indian law with regard to the rights, privileges, powers, duties and
20 immunities of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of
21 Maliseet Indians and their tribal members and land or other natural resources, including
22 laws, regulations and common law of the United States enacted for the benefit of Indians,
23 Indian nations or tribes or bands of Indians and laws, regulations and common law that
24 accord a special status or right to or that relate to a special status or right of any Indian,
25 Indian nation, tribe or band of Indians, Indian lands, Indian reservations, Indian country,
26 Indian territory, trust land or other natural resources held in trust for Indians.
27 Sec. 5. 30 MRSA §6203, as amended by PL 2023, c. 369, Pt. D, §§1 and 2 and

11 section 6203, subsection 11 in trust for the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians pursuant to
12 the federal Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians Supplementary Claims Settlement Act of
13 1986, Public Law 99-566, Section 2(2) or pursuant to any other applicable federal Indian
14 law as defined in Title 30, section 6203, subsection 1-B, including but not limited to the
15 federal Indian Reorganization Act, Public Law 73-383, and its implementing regulations
16 as described in Title 30, section 6205-B, subsection 2.
17 Sec. 61. Dispute resolution. The Governor, the Attorney General and the
18 Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians,
19 through their respective designees, must collaborate on an alternative dispute resolution
20 process to resolve tribal-state disputes, to be known as "the ADR work group." The Maine
21 Indian Tribal-State Commission established under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 30,
22 section 6212, subsection 1 shall provide assistance to the ADR work group by providing
23 input and answering questions regarding alternative dispute resolution options appropriate
24 to tribal-state disputes, including identifying best practices, developing mutual respect,
25 working on a government-to-government basis and respecting the sovereignty of the
26 Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and
27 the State, and any existing culturally appropriate models. No later than November 15, 2025,
28 the ADR work group shall provide a report to the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary
29 that includes its findings and recommendations, including suggested legislation, regarding
30 a tribal-state alternative dispute resolution process. The committee may report out
31 legislation to the Second Regular Session of the 132nd Legislature based on the
32 recommendations of the ADR work group.
33 Sec. 62. Contingent effective date. This Act takes effect 150 days after
34 adjournment of the First Regular Session of the 132nd Legislature only if, within 120 days
35 after adjournment of the First Regular Session of the 132nd Legislature, the Secretary of
36 State receives written certification from the Chief of the Penobscot Nation, or the designee
37 under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 3, section 602, that the nation has agreed to the
38 provisions of this Act; from the Chief of the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Sipayik and the Chief
39 of the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Motahkomikuk, or the designee under Title 3, section 602,
40 that the tribe has agreed to the provisions of this Act; and from the Chief of the Houlton
41 Band of Maliseet Indians, or the designee under Title 3, section 602, that the band has
42 agreed to the provisions of this Act, copies of which must be submitted by the Secretary of
43 State to the Secretary of the Senate, the Clerk of the House and the Revisor of Statutes.
44 Upon such written certification by the Houlton Band Council of the Houlton Band of
45 Maliseet Indians, each section of this Act regarding or affecting the Houlton Band of
Page 22 - 132LR0235(01)

416 Maliseet Indians and its tribal members and lands constitutes a jurisdictional agreement for
427 purposes of the federal Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980, Public Law 96-420,
438 Section 6(e)(2). Such written certification by the Houlton Band Council of the Houlton
449 Band of Maliseet Indians does not constitute an agreement that the contingencies in Public
550 Law 1981, chapter 675 were met or that the provisions of Public Law 1981, chapter 675
561 ever took effect.
7 SUMMARY
88 This bill implements several of the consensus recommendations of the Task Force on
99 Changes to the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Implementing Act governing the
1100 relationship between the State and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, the
1111 Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation. The January 14, 2020 report of the Task
1122 Force on Changes to the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Implementing Act is available
1133 online at http://legislature.maine.gov/maine-indian-claims-tf.
14 The bill makes substantial changes to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 30, chapter
15 601, currently known as "AN ACT to Implement the Maine Indian Claims Settlement,"
16 including by renaming the chapter "the Maine Implementing Act." The bill is designed to
17 restore to the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of
18 Maliseet Indians many of the rights to self-determination enjoyed by other federally
19 recognized Indian tribes within the United States. To carry out this purpose, the bill repeals
20 or amends many provisions of the Maine Implementing Act to recognize that federal Indian
21 law governs the rights, privileges, powers, duties and immunities of the tribe, nation and
22 band. "Federal Indian law" is defined to mean the United States Constitution and all
23 generally applicable federal statutes and regulations as well as common law and case law
24 interpreting, implementing, applying or enforcing those constitutional, statutory and
25 regulatory provisions relating to the rights, status, privileges, powers, duties and
26 immunities of federally recognized Indian tribes and their members and land or other
27 natural resources within the United States.
28 With respect to tribal land acquisition, the bill:
29 1. Repeals the definition of "Houlton Band Jurisdiction Land" enacted in Public Law
30 2023, chapter 369 and instead recognizes that the rights, privileges, powers, duties and
31 immunities of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians recognized in the Maine Implementing
32 Act apply to "Houlton Band Trust Land," which is defined to include all land and natural
33 resources acquired by the United States Secretary of the Interior in trust for the band under
34 the federal Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians Supplementary Claims Settlement Act of
35 1986 or any other applicable federal law, including the federal Indian Reorganization Act;
36 2. Amends the provisions describing Passamaquoddy Indian territory and Penobscot
37 Indian territory, the lands over which the tribe and the nation have the rights, privileges,
38 powers, duties and immunities of federally recognized Indian tribes under the Maine
39 Implementing Act. The bill restructures the procedures for land acquired by the United
40 States Secretary of the Interior in trust for the tribe or the nation to be considered Indian
41 territory. Instead of limiting trust land acquisition to specifically described parcels of land,
42 the bill recognizes as Indian territory any land acquired by the secretary in trust for the tribe
43 or nation within specific counties of the State either prior to the effective date of this
44 legislation or after the effective date of this legislation if the land is not located within the
45 borders of a city, town, village or plantation. If trust land within the specified counties is
Page 23 - 132LR0235(01)

416 acquired after the effective date of this legislation and is located within the borders of a
427 city, town, village or plantation, it may be considered Indian territory if the tribe or nation
438 enters into an agreement with the local government addressing payments in lieu of taxes,
449 allocation of law enforcement responsibility and land use. Lands acquired in trust for the
550 tribe or the nation under any applicable federal law, including the federal Indian
561 Reorganization Act, are also considered Indian territory;
7 3. Includes within Passamaquoddy Indian territory all lands owned in fee simple by
8 the Passamaquoddy Tribe on the effective date of this legislation if those lands are located
9 within specific counties and are subsequently acquired by the United States Secretary of
10 the Interior in trust for the Passamaquoddy Tribe; and
11 4. Repeals the provisions of the Maine Implementing Act regarding the takings of
12 tribal lands for public use.
13 The bill provides that the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton
14 Band of Maliseet Indians, as well as their officers and employees, are immune from suit to
15 the same extent as other federally recognized Indian tribes and their officers and employees
16 under federal Indian law.
17 With respect to the regulation of natural resources, the bill:
18 1. Recognizes the exclusive authority of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot
19 Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians to regulate fishing, hunting, trapping and
20 other taking of wildlife by both tribal and nontribal citizens within their respective Indian
21 territories and trust land;
22 2. Retains the authority of the Maine Indian Tribal-State Commission under current
23 law to regulate fishing on boundary waters; and
24 3. Authorizes the State, solely for conservation purposes, to regulate tribal members
25 engaged in fishing, hunting, trapping and other taking of wildlife off Indian territory or
26 trust land to the extent permitted under federal Indian law and consistent with reserved
27 tribal treaty rights.
28 The bill combines within one section of the Maine Implementing Act the authority of
29 law enforcement officers appointed by the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, the
30 Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation to enforce laws within their respective
31 Indian territories and trust land. The bill recognizes that law enforcement officers
32 appointed by the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation have exclusive authority
33 to enforce within their respective Indian territories, and law enforcement officers appointed
34 by the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians have exclusive authority to enforce within
35 Houlton Band Trust Land, the criminal and juvenile laws over which their respective tribal
36 courts have exclusive jurisdiction.
37 The bill also recognizes the authority of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians to create
38 a tribal school committee analogous to the authority of the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the
39 Penobscot Nation to create tribal school committees under current law.
40 With respect to civil jurisdiction, the bill:
41 1. Recognizes the exclusive authority, under federal Indian law, of the Houlton Band
42 of Maliseet Indians, the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation to exercise civil
Page 24 - 132LR0235(01)

413 regulatory authority on their respective Indian territory or trust land over their respective
424 tribal members and tribal entities;
3 2. Recognizes the concurrent authority with the State, under federal Indian law, of the
4 Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation to
5 exercise civil regulatory authority on their respective Indian territory or trust land over
6 persons and entities who are not tribal citizens or tribal entities; and
7 3. Recognizes and adopts the application of federal Indian law with respect to the
8 authority of the State and of the tribal courts of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, the
9 Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation to exercise adjudicatory jurisdiction over
10 civil actions arising on the band's, tribe's or nation's respective Indian territory or trust land.
11 The bill also requires the development of a dispute resolution process to facilitate
12 resolution of disputes between the State and tribes.
13 The bill explicitly provides that, for purposes of the federal Maine Indian Claims
14 Settlement Act of 1980, Public Law 96-420, except for any provision of federal Indian law
15 that conflicts with the Maine Implementing Act's allocation between the State and the tribes
16 of jurisdiction over crimes and juvenile crimes, the provisions of any federal law enacted
17 before, on or after October 10, 1980, that accords a special status or right to or relates to a
18 special status or right of any Indian, Indian nation, tribe or band of Indians, Indian lands,
19 Indian reservations, Indian country, Indian territory or land held in trust for Indians applies
20 to the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians
21 and their members and tribal lands. However, the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot
22 Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians may conduct gaming activities only in
23 accordance with state law and not under the authority of the federal Indian Gaming
24 Regulatory Act or its implementing regulations.
25 Finally, the bill either repeals or repeals and replaces each provision of the Maine
26 Implementing Act that was enacted by Public Law 1981, chapter 675 and provides that, if
27 the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians certifies its agreement to the provisions of this
28 legislation, that agreement constitutes a jurisdictional agreement between the State and the
29 Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians for purposes of the federal Maine Indian Claims
30 Settlement Act of 1980, Public Law 96-420, Section 6(e)(2) but does not constitute an
31 agreement by the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians that the provisions of Public Law 1981,
32 chapter 675 ever took effect.
33 The provisions of this bill take effect 150 days after adjournment of the First Regular
34 Session of the 132nd Legislature only if the relevant officials of the Passamaquoddy Tribe,
35 the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians certify the tribe's, nation's
36 and band's agreements to the legislation within 120 days after adjournment of the First
37 Regular Session of the 132nd Legislature.
