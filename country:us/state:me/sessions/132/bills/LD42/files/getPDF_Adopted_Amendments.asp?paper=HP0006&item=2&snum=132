1 (2) The Juvenile Court that conducts the bind-over hearing may grant a request
2 made pursuant to subparagraph (1). If the request is made to the Juvenile Court

6 subsequently, the Juvenile Court shall decide whether to grant the request prior to
7 the juvenile attaining 18 years of age.
8 (3) The Juvenile Court shall consider the following factors in deciding whether to
9 permit a bound-over juvenile to remain within a juvenile facility pending the return
10 of an indictment:
11 (a) Whether the juvenile's behavior at the juvenile facility creates a risk of harm
12 to others at the facility;
