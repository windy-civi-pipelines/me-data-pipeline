At the close of each fiscal year, the State Controller shall transfer to the Department of
Transportation, Secondary Road Program Fund, established in section 1803‑C and referred

exceeding $100,000 from the unallocated balance in the Highway Fund to the Department
of Transportation Highway and Bridge Capital; Highway Light Capital; Maintenance and
Operations; and Multimodal Transportation Fund programs, for capital and all other needs.
The Commissioner of Transportation may allot these funds by financial order upon the
recommendation of the State Budget Officer and the approval of the Governor. The
transferred amounts are considered adjustments to allocations. Within 30 days after
approval of the financial order, the Commissioner of Transportation shall provide to the
joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over transportation matters
a report detailing the financial status of the Department of Transportation, Highway and
Bridge Capital program.
