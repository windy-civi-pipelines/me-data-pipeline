1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 35-A MRSA §3131, sub-§4-E is enacted to read:
3 4-E. Local consumption standard. "Local consumption standard" means a
4 requirement that at least 50% of the electricity delivered by a high-impact electric
5 transmission line into the State will be allocated to and consumed within the State.
6 Sec. 2. 35-A MRSA §3132, sub-§6-F is enacted to read:
7 6-F. High-impact electric transmission line; local consumption standard. On or
8 after December 31, 2026, the commission may not issue a certificate of public convenience
9 and necessity approving the construction of a high-impact electric transmission line to
10 deliver electricity generated in Canada through this State within the electric grid operated
11 by the New England independent system operator unless the high-impact electric
12 transmission line meets the local consumption standard.
13 The commission may issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity approving
14 the construction of a high-impact electric transmission line that does not meet the local
15 consumption standard if the commission determines that requiring the high-impact electric
16 transmission line to meet the local consumption standard would interfere with the reliability
17 of the electric grid or regional energy agreements necessary for energy security in the State.
18 This subsection is repealed December 31, 2031.
19 Sec. 3. 35-A MRSA §3132-E is enacted to read:
20 §3132-E. Local consumption standard required; reporting
21 1. Local consumption standard required. On or after December 31, 2026, a person
22 may not operate a high-impact electric transmission line to deliver electricity generated in
23 Canada through this State to other states within the electric grid operated by the New
24 England independent system operator unless the high-impact electric transmission line
25 meets the local consumption standard.
26 2. Reporting. A person operating a high-impact electric transmission line that receives
27 a certificate of public convenience and necessity in accordance with section 3132,
28 subsection 6-F shall file on a quarterly basis with the commission a report that must include,
29 but is not limited to, the total amount of electricity delivered to the State through the high-
30 impact electric transmission line, the total amount of electricity allocated and consumed
31 within the State and the total amount of electricity delivered to other states within the
32 electric grid operated by the New England independent system operator.
33 3. Penalty. If the commission finds that a person operating a high-impact electric
34 transmission line violates any provision of this section, the commission shall, in an
35 adjudicatory proceeding, impose an administrative penalty on the operator of the high-
36 impact electric transmission line. In determining the amount of an administrative penalty
37 under this section, the commission shall consider the factors listed in section 1508-A,
38 subsection 2. Each quarter a violation continues constitutes a separate offense. The
39 maximum administrative penalty for a violation may not exceed $575,000 or 5% of the
40 gross revenue that the operator of the high-impact electric transmission line received from
41 the sale of electricity outside of the State during the quarter in which the violation occurred,
42 whichever amount is lower. Notwithstanding section 117, subsection 3, administrative
Page 1 - 132LR0600(01)
413 penalties collected by the commission must be deposited into the Public Utilities

20 SUMMARY
2211 This bill prohibits, beginning December 31, 2026, the Public Utilities Commission
2222 from issuing a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the construction of a high-
2233 impact electric transmission line to deliver electricity generated in Canada to other states
2244 within the electric grid operated by the New England independent system operator unless
2255 at least 50% of the electricity delivered to the State will be allocated to and consumed
2266 within the State. It requires the person operating a high-impact electric transmission line to
2277 file quarterly reports with the commission and provides that any penalties for
2288 noncompliance with the requirements of the law are paid into the Public Utilities
2299 Commission Energy Affordability Fund. The bill requires the commission to review the
3300 requirement established by the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3132-E,
3311 subsection 1 and develop recommendations for how the cost of electricity may be reduced
3322 to increase consumption and ensure that the 50% threshold required by the bill is met. By
3333 December 31, 2025, the commission must provide a report to the Joint Standing Committee
3344 on Energy, Utilities and Technology regarding its findings, including any
3355 recommendations for legislation.
36 No later than December 31, 2030, the commission is required to provide a report to the
37 joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over electricity matters
38 assessing the local consumption standard requirement, including an evaluation of the laws'
39 effect on the benefits and costs to electricity customers in the State and on regional energy
40 markets. The commission's report must include recommendations regarding the
41 continuation of the local consumption standard requirement. The bill includes a provision
42 that repeals the laws on December 31, 2031.
43 The bill also requires that, beginning December 31, 2027, each transmission and
44 distribution utility and competitive electricity provider to submit to the commission an
Page 3 - 132LR0600(01)
415 annual report describing the transmission and distribution utility's or competitive electricity
426 provider's efforts to collaborate with state and local economic development agencies to
437 encourage the expansion of businesses in the State or the relocation of businesses to the
448 State, including specific actions taken or considered by the transmission and distribution
459 utility or competitive electricity provider.
