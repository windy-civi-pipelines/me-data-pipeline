3 further amended to read:
4 B. "Reference base index" means:
5 (1) With respect to calculations made under this section subsection 2 relating to
6 dollar amounts stated in sections 2‑102, 2‑402, 2‑403, 2‑405 and 3‑1201, the
7 Consumer Price Index for calendar year 2017; and
8 (2) With respect to calculations made under this section subsection 2 relating to
9 the dollar amount stated in section 2‑807 for loss of comfort, society and
10 companionship, the Consumer Price Index for calendar year 2023.; and
11 (3) With respect to calculations made under subsection 3, the Consumer Price
12 Index for calendar year 2024.
13 Sec. 2. 18-C MRSA §1-108, sub-§3 is enacted to read:
14 3. Automatic adjustment of filing fees. The filing fee dollar amounts stated in
15 sections 1-602, 1-701, 9-301 and 9-312 apply to the fees assessed when the petition or
16 motion referenced in those sections is filed with the court in 2025, but for petitions or
17 motions filed after 2025, these dollar amounts must be increased or decreased if the
18 Consumer Price Index for the calendar year immediately preceding the year in which the
19 petition or motion was filed exceeds or is less than the reference base index. The amount
20 of any increase or decrease is computed by multiplying each dollar amount by the
21 percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for the calendar year immediately
22 preceding the year in which the petition or motion was filed exceeds or is less than the
23 reference base index. If any increase or decrease produced by the computation is not a
24 multiple of $5, the increase or decrease is rounded down, if an increase, or up, if a decrease,
25 to the next multiple of $5. With respect to calculations made under this subsection, if the
26 Consumer Price Index for calendar year 2024 is changed by the United States Department
27 of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, the reference base index must be revised using the
28 rebasing factor reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics or other comparable data if a
29 rebasing factor is not reported.
30 Sec. 3. 18-C MRSA §1-112 is enacted to read:
31 §1-112. Use of artificial intelligence technology in documents filed with the court
32 1. Verification of court filing. A party that uses artificial intelligence technology to
33 create or to assist in creating any petition, motion or other document filed with the court

35 other document that were created using artificial intelligence technology.
36 2. Sanctions for noncompliance. If the court finds that a party failed to comply with
37 the requirements of this section, it may impose any sanction that is appropriate in the
38 circumstances.
39 Sec. 4. 18-C MRSA §1-602, as amended by PL 2021, c. 250, §1, is further amended

25 SUMMARY
2266 This bill makes the following changes to the Maine Uniform Probate Code.
27 1. It increases certain filing fees throughout the Code and provides that, after 2025,
28 these fees must automatically be adjusted for inflation.
29 2. It requires any party that files a petition, motion or other document with a probate
30 court that is created with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology to verify the
31 accuracy of the petition, motion or other document by affidavit and authorizes the court to
32 impose appropriate sanctions on parties that violate this requirement.
33 3. It requires a personal representative who has mailed an inventory of the property of
34 the decedent to all interested parties who requested the inventory to also file the inventory
35 with the court. Under current law, the personal representative has discretion to file the
36 inventory with the court in these circumstances.
37 4. It provides that, like a guardian ad litem appointed by a probate court, a visitor
38 appointed by a probate court is entitled to quasi-judicial immunity for acts performed
39 within the scope of the visitor's duties.
40 5. It changes from 14 years of age or older to 12 years of age or older the age at which
41 an adoptee must consent either to a parent's consent to have the child adopted by a specific
Page 4 - 132LR0934(01)

412 petitioner or to a parent's surrender and release of the parent's parental rights in favor of a
423 licensed child-placing agency or the Department of Health and Human Services.
