10 SUMMARY
1111 This bill modifies the provisions of law governing distribution of stipends to persons
1122 or entities licensed to hold an agricultural fair.
13 Under current law, after certain distributions are made from the Stipend Fund pursuant
14 to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 7, section 86, the amount remaining is distributed
15 among fair licensees meeting certain requirements. Distributions are based on premiums
16 and gratuities actually paid by the licensees. The current law limits the use of premiums
17 and gratuities for determination of apportionment to premiums and gratuities paid for
18 certain specified activities and events.
19 The bill broadens the activities and events that may be considered in the calculation of
20 apportionment for stipends by specifying that, in addition to the activities and events
21 considered under current law, any other agricultural event approved by the Commissioner
22 of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry may be used to determine the apportionment.
