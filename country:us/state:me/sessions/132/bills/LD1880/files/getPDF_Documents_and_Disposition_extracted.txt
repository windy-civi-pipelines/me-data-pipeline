5 A. The voter may contact the voter's aide or witness and request that the aide or witness
6 cure the defect by appearing in person at the clerk's office and properly completing the

27 confirmed that the voter personally signed the return envelope pursuant to section 756‑A,
28 subsection 2 when applicable, that the voter is registered and enrolled when necessary and
29 that it contains the voter's Maine driver's license or nondriver identification card number or
30 a copy of the voter's photographic identification, the warden shall then examine the
31 incoming voting list to determine whether the voter voted in person at the election. The
32 warden shall then announce the name of each absentee voter who has not voted at the
33 election and remove each ballot from its envelope without destroying the envelope or
34 unfolding the ballot. After having an election clerk from a political party different from
35 that of the warden mark the letters "AV" beside the name of each absentee voter on the
36 incoming voting lists and place a check mark or horizontal line in red ink on the list beside
37 the voter's name, the warden shall accept the ballot.
38 Sec. 29. Effective date. This Act takes effect January 1, 2026.
39 SUMMARY
4400 This bill requires the presentation of photographic identification for in-person and
4411 absentee voting. Acceptable forms of photographic identification include an unexpired
4422 Maine driver's license, nondriver identification card, interim identification form issued by
4433 the Secretary of State, United States passport or United States passport card, United States
4444 military identification card, Maine National Guard identification card and United States
Page 10 - 132LR0339(01)
415 Department of Veterans Affairs identification card. The bill directs the Secretary of State
426 to provide free nondriver identification cards for photographic identification. The bill
437 allows voters without photographic identification to complete a challenged ballot and
448 within 4 days after the date of the election appear before the registrar of voters and present
459 photographic identification. The bill also provides an exception for voters with religious
560 objections to being photographed. The bill removes provisions of law that allow voters to
571 make telephone applications for absentee ballots and that allow voters to automatically
582 receive absentee ballots for each election without submitting a separate request for each
593 election. It also provides that a municipality may have only one secured drop box for the
1504 return of absentee ballots. It requires that a secured drop box be monitored at all times by
1515 a surveillance camera and that the video from this surveillance camera be accessible to a
1526 resident of the municipality in which the secured drop box is located.

4 Sec. 24. 21-A MRSA §754-A, sub-§2, as amended by PL 1999, c. 645, §7, is

23 B. The voter or the aide must mark the ballot in the presence of one of the following
24 witnesses: Notary public, clerk of a municipality, clerk of courts or another individual.
25 C. The voter or the aide, before marking the ballot, must show it to the witness who
26 must examine it to be certain it is unmarked.
27 D. While the voter or the aide is marking the ballot, there may be no communication
28 between the voter and any individual, other than the aide who must mark the ballot as
29 the voter indicates, as to the person or question for which the voter is to vote.
30 E. The voter or the aide must mark the ballot according to section 691 or 692 so that
31 it is impossible for anyone else present to see how the voter voted, then seal the ballot

33 sign the affidavit in the presence of the witness, who shall sign the witness certification.

38 clerk of the municipality of which the voter is a resident. The voter must send a
39 completed voter registration or absentee ballot application, if necessary, in a separate
40 envelope.

5 A. The voter may contact the voter's aide or witness and request that the aide or witness
6 cure the defect by appearing in person at the clerk's office and properly completing the
7 affidavit or witness certification. If the aide or witness corrects the affidavit or witness
8 certification as provided in this paragraph before the deadline for returning absentee
9 ballots under section 755, the clerk shall accept the absentee ballot without challenge.
10 B. The voter may cure the defect by telephone by self-identifying by name, date of
11 birth and residence address, confirming that the voter requested an absentee ballot and
12 explaining whether a 3rd person other than the voter's immediate family member
13 delivered or returned the absentee ballot or whether the voter received the assistance
14 of an aide as described in section 754‑A, subsection 3 in reading, marking or placing
15 the ballot in the return envelope. If the voter provides the information required by this

23 amended to read:
24 2. Accepted if correct. If the warden finds that the affidavit and the aide and witness
25 certification, if required, are properly completed, that the clerk has verified that the
26 signature on the envelope matches the signature on the application or that the voter
27 confirmed that the voter personally signed the return envelope pursuant to section 756‑A,
28 subsection 2 when applicable, that the voter is registered and enrolled when necessary and
29 that it contains the voter's Maine driver's license or nondriver identification card number or
30 a copy of the voter's photographic identification, the warden shall then examine the
31 incoming voting list to determine whether the voter voted in person at the election. The
32 warden shall then announce the name of each absentee voter who has not voted at the
33 election and remove each ballot from its envelope without destroying the envelope or
34 unfolding the ballot. After having an election clerk from a political party different from
35 that of the warden mark the letters "AV" beside the name of each absentee voter on the
36 incoming voting lists and place a check mark or horizontal line in red ink on the list beside
37 the voter's name, the warden shall accept the ballot.
38 Sec. 29. Effective date. This Act takes effect January 1, 2026.
39 SUMMARY
4400 This bill requires the presentation of photographic identification for in-person and
4411 absentee voting. Acceptable forms of photographic identification include an unexpired
4422 Maine driver's license, nondriver identification card, interim identification form issued by
4433 the Secretary of State, United States passport or United States passport card, United States
4444 military identification card, Maine National Guard identification card and United States
Page 10 - 132LR0339(01)

415 Department of Veterans Affairs identification card. The bill directs the Secretary of State
426 to provide free nondriver identification cards for photographic identification. The bill
437 allows voters without photographic identification to complete a challenged ballot and
448 within 4 days after the date of the election appear before the registrar of voters and present
459 photographic identification. The bill also provides an exception for voters with religious
560 objections to being photographed. The bill removes provisions of law that allow voters to
571 make telephone applications for absentee ballots and that allow voters to automatically
582 receive absentee ballots for each election without submitting a separate request for each
593 election. It also provides that a municipality may have only one secured drop box for the
1504 return of absentee ballots. It requires that a secured drop box be monitored at all times by
1515 a surveillance camera and that the video from this surveillance camera be accessible to a
1526 resident of the municipality in which the secured drop box is located.
