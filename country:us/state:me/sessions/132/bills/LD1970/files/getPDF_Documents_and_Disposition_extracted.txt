1 SUMMARY
22 This bill provides that an HIV test may be undertaken with a patient's general consent.
33 The bill defines "general consent" to mean consent obtained without undue inducement or
44 any element of compulsion, fraud, deceit, duress or any other form of constraint or coercion
55 and that is obtained after providing instruction to a patient that, as part of a medical
66 procedure or test, the patient may receive an HIV test and that receiving an HIV test is
77 voluntary and the patient may choose not to submit to an HIV test. The bill also provides
88 that disclosure of information in a medical record for the purpose of seeking insurance
99 reimbursement for HIV testing is not precluded. The bill removes the requirement that an
1100 HIV test may be undertaken only with a patient's informed consent.
