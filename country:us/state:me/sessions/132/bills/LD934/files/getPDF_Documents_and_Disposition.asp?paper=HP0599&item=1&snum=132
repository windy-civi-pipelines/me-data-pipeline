3300 Under the Maine resident homestead property tax exemption, an eligible homestead is

3322 of the exemption is based on the certified assessment ratio provided by a municipality to
3333 the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Revenue Services.
3344 Unless the municipality has a certified assessment ratio of 100%, the exemption amount is
3355 less than $25,000.
36 This bill provides 100% of the exemption amount, regardless of the assessment ratio
37 of the municipality, to an individual who qualifies for the Maine resident homestead
38 property tax exemption and is either at least 65 years of age or a veteran who served in the
39 Armed Forces of the United States. This bill also requires the State to reimburse a

410 municipality for 100% of the revenue lost as a result of this full exemption. Currently, the
421 State reimburses municipalities 76% of the revenue lost due to the Maine resident
432 homestead property tax exemption.
