33 jurisdiction over all children's services delivered or arranged by the State. It endows the
44 Child Advocate with authority to receive complaints, access information, investigate,
55 publicly report, make recommendations and advise the Governor, the Legislature,
66 administrators of state agencies and the public on the best interests of children in providing
77 services. It repeals the provision creating the ombudsman program in the Child and Family

1 SUMMARY
22 This bill establishes the Office of the Child Advocate as an independent agency with
33 jurisdiction over all children's services delivered or arranged by the State. It endows the
44 Child Advocate with authority to receive complaints, access information, investigate,
55 publicly report, make recommendations and advise the Governor, the Legislature,
66 administrators of state agencies and the public on the best interests of children in providing
77 services. It repeals the provision creating the ombudsman program in the Child and Family
88 Services and Child Protection Act but retains services formerly provided by the
99 ombudsman to be provided by the Office of the Child Advocate. It also provides for the
1100 transfer of funding from the ombudsman program to the Office of the Child Advocate.
