44 Child Advocate with authority to receive complaints, access information, investigate,
55 publicly report, make recommendations and advise the Governor, the Legislature,
66 administrators of state agencies and the public on the best interests of children in providing
77 services. It repeals the provision creating the ombudsman program in the Child and Family

99 ombudsman to be provided by the Office of the Child Advocate. It also provides for the
1100 transfer of funding from the ombudsman program to the Office of the Child Advocate.
