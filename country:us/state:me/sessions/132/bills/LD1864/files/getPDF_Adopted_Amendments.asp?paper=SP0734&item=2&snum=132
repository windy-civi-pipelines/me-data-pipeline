1 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section
2 number to read consecutively.
3 SUMMARY
44 This amendment amends the bill by providing a time-limited exemption to the Maine
55 Revised Statutes, Title 30-A, section 4353, subsection 4, paragraph A to allow any person
66 in the State, not just those in the Town of Harpswell as proposed in the bill, whose dock,

88 9, 2024 to January 13, 2024, to, no later than December 31, 2027, petition a municipality’s
99 board of appeals for and be granted a variance from a municipal shoreland zoning ordinance
1100 or a municipal floodplain management ordinance, even if the land on which the structure
1111 is located was not damaged to such an extent that it yields no reasonable return, so that the
1122 person may conduct repairs on those structures and may do so in time to take advantage of
1133 federal funds available pursuant to an emergency declaration. The amendment also
1144 changes the bill from a private and special law to a public law.
