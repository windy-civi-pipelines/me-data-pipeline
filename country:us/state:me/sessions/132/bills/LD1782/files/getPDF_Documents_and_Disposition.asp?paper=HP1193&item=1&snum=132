1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, this legislation must be adopted before the end of the 90-day period due to
4 ongoing and severe solid waste disposal issues at the Juniper Ridge Landfill in the City of
5 Old Town that must be resolved as quickly as possible; and
6 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
7 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
8 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
9 therefore,
10 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
11 Sec. 1. 38 MRSA ยง2122, sub-ยง3 is enacted to read:

16 contract operator of any state-owned or state-operated landfill pays a base per ton host fee
17 of not less than $5.00 per ton for all acceptable waste disposed of at the landfill. The
18 department shall annually index the base per ton host fee amount for inflation. All revenues
19 generated by the base per ton host fee must be allocated as follows:
20 A. Fifty percent to the municipality hosting the landfill to offset municipal costs and
21 burdens; and
22 B. Fifty percent to the regional school unit or other school unit serving the host
23 municipality to alleviate the property tax impact associated with the municipality's
24 hosting the landfill.
25 This subsection applies to any existing host community compensation and facility oversight
26 or similar agreement for a state-owned or state-operated landfill and to any future such
27 agreement.
28 The department shall impose a per ton surcharge on municipal solid waste sent to the state-
29 operated or state-owned landfill from a municipality that is not making reasonable efforts
30 to meet the State's recycling goals pursuant to sections 2132 and 2133. The department
31 shall set the surcharge at a level sufficient to incentivize compliance.
32 The bureau and the department shall require the contract operator of a state-owned or state-
33 operated landfill to provide free disposal of household municipal solid waste for residents
34 of a municipality hosting a state-owned or state-operated landfill.
35 Sec. 2. 38 MRSA ยง2122, sub-ยง4 is enacted to read:
36 4. Comprehensive solid waste management plan. The department and the
37 Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of General Services, referred
38 to in this subsection as "the bureau," shall jointly develop a comprehensive solid waste
39 management plan for a state-owned or state-operated landfill. In creating a plan under this
40 subsection, the department and bureau shall consult with owners and operators of public
41 and private solid waste management facilities and municipalities and quasi-municipal
42 entities involved with the state-owned or state-operated landfill.

10 (4) Propose any legislative or regulatory changes needed to preserve landfill
11 capacity, mitigate host-community burdens and improve statewide recycling and

5 SUMMARY
66 This bill updates the Juniper Ridge Landfill host community compensation agreement

88 landfill. It further directs the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau
99 of General Services and the Department of Environmental Protection to immediately
1100 investigate and address, through preparation of a solid waste management plan, several
1111 critical issues and developments in the State's solid waste management system involving
1122 the Juniper Ridge Landfill in the City of Old Town that have converged to create a crisis
1133 for approximately 159 central and northern municipalities and for sewer and utility districts
1144 and departments all across the State. The bill applies the same terms to other state-owned
1155 or state-operated landfills in the State.
