provide assistance to distressed borrowers, but these criminals may instead take your
money and private information without providing any assistance. You are encouraged
to seek help from a housing counselor who works for a housing counseling agency
approved by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
or from an attorney licensed to practice in the State of Maine."
