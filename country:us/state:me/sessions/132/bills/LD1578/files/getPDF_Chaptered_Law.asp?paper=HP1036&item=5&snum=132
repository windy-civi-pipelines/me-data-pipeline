Resolve, to Establish the Commission to Evaluate the Scope of Regulatory
Review and Oversight over Health Care Transactions That Impact the
Delivery of Health Care Services in the State
Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, this resolve establishes a commission to evaluate the scope of regulatory
review and oversight over health care transactions that impact the delivery of health care
services in the State; and
Whereas, the Legislature believes it is important to conduct this evaluation because
the State's health care delivery system faces significant financial and workforce challenges;
and
Whereas, this legislation must take effect as soon as possible in order to provide
adequate time for the commission to complete its work in a timely manner before
submitting its report; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore, be it
Sec. 1. Commission established. Resolved: That the Commission to Evaluate
