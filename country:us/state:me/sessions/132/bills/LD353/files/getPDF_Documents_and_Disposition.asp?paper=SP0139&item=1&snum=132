1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, deed fraud occurs when a person sells real property by falsely claiming to
4 be the property owner and records a deed of the fraudulently induced sale in the registry of
5 deeds, depriving the rightful owner of a significant asset without the owner's knowledge;
6 and
7 Whereas, the process for the rightful owner of the property to nullify a fraudulently
8 recorded deed is not only time-consuming and expensive but, if successful, can also leave
9 the innocent purchaser of the property with neither the property nor the funds used to
10 purchase the property from the perpetrator of the deed fraud; and
11 Whereas, this legislation establishes the Commission to Recommend Methods for
12 Preventing Deed Fraud in the State to study options for both preventing deed fraud and
13 recompensing the victims of deed fraud; and
14 Whereas, the study must be initiated before the 90-day period expires in order that
15 the study may be completed and a report submitted in time for submission to the next
16 legislative session; and
17 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
18 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
19 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
20 therefore, be it
