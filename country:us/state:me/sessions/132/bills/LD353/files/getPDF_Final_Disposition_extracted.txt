Deed Fraud in the State
Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, deed fraud occurs when a person sells real property by falsely claiming to
be the property owner and records a deed of the fraudulently induced sale in the registry of
deeds, depriving the rightful owner of a significant asset without the owner's knowledge;
and
Whereas, the process for the rightful owner of the property to nullify a fraudulently
recorded deed is not only time-consuming and expensive but, if successful, can also leave
the innocent purchaser of the property with neither the property nor the funds used to
purchase the property from the perpetrator of the deed fraud; and
Whereas, this legislation establishes the Commission to Recommend Methods for
Preventing Deed Fraud in the State to study options for both preventing deed fraud and
recompensing the victims of deed fraud; and
Whereas, the study must be initiated before the 90-day period expires in order that
the study may be completed and a report submitted in time for submission to the next
legislative session; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore, be it
Sec. 1. Commission established. Resolved: That the Commission to Recommend
