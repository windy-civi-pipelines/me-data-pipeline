Whereas, the land authorized for transfer by this resolve is within the designations in
the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 12, section 598-A; and
Whereas, the Director of the Bureau of Parks and Lands within the Department of
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry may sell, lease or exchange lands with the approval
of the Legislature in accordance with the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 12, sections 1814,
1837 and 1851; now, therefore, be it
Sec. 1. Director of the Bureau of Parks and Lands directed to modify the
deed that conveyed Montpelier, the General Henry Knox Museum, consisting
of historic site land, improvements, structures and historical collections, to the
Friends of Montpelier. Resolved: That the Director of the Bureau of Parks and Lands
within the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry shall modify the deed that
conveyed Montpelier, the General Henry Knox Museum, including 4.2 acres, more or less,
of historic site land and related improvements, structures and historical collections, in the
Town of Thomaston, Knox County, to the Friends of Montpelier, a nonprofit corporation,

any requirement that Montpelier be preserved, rehabilitated or restored in a manner as
required by the Maine Historic Preservation Commission.
