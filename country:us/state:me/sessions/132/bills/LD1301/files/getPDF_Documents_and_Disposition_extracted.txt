9 (1) Be based upon an enrollee's medical history, as applicable, and individual
10 clinical circumstances as presented by the requesting provider, as well as other

15 expression, sexual orientation, present or predicted disability, expected length of
16 life, degree of medical dependency, quality of life or other health conditions;

19 the written policies and procedures to an enrollee.
20 Use of artificial intelligence pursuant to this paragraph must be governed by policies

22 revised for accuracy and reliability. Data under this paragraph may not be used beyond

25 B. A denial, delay, modification or adjustment of health care services based on medical
26 necessity must be made by a clinical peer competent to evaluate the specific clinical
27 issues involved in the health care services requested by the enrollee's provider. The
28 clinical peer making the medical review or utilization review determination shall
29 consider the enrollee's provider's recommendation and the enrollee's medical history,
30 as applicable, and individual clinical circumstances.
31 For purposes of this subsection, "artificial intelligence" means an engineered or machine-
32 based system that varies in its level of autonomy and that can, for explicit or implicit
33 objectives, infer from the input it receives how to generate outputs that can influence
34 physical or virtual environments.
35 SUMMARY
3366 This bill establishes requirements, beginning January 1, 2026, for health insurance
3377 carriers that use artificial intelligence to make medical review or utilization review
3388 determinations relating to the approval, denial, delay, modification or adjustment of
