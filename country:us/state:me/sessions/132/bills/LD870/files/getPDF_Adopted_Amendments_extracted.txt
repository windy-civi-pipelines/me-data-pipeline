11 SUMMARY
1122 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, amends the
1133 membership of the Maine Land Use Planning Commission by increasing the number of
1144 members from 9 to 11, rather than 13 in the bill, with the Governor appointing 2 members;
1155 rather than 5 members in the bill. The amendment also directs the President of the Senate
1166 and the Speaker of the House of Representatives to appoint one member to the commission.
17 Current law provides that if a board of county commissioners fails to appoint a member
18 to the commission within 90 days of a vacancy on the commission to be filled by that
19 county, the Governor is required to appoint a resident of that county meeting certain criteria
20 to fill that vacancy. The bill changes the number of days to 30; the amendment strikes the
21 change in the bill and retains current law.
22 The amendment adds qualifications to be considered by the Governor when appointing
23 members to the commission. The amendment removes from the bill a membership term
24 limit of 2 consecutive 4-year terms. The amendment also removes from the bill the
25 provision relating to staggered terms.
2266 The amendment also strikes the requirement in the bill that the Secretary of State
2277 include information about the members of the commission in the Secretary of State's annual
2288 report on board appointments.

1122 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, amends the
1133 membership of the Maine Land Use Planning Commission by increasing the number of
1144 members from 9 to 11, rather than 13 in the bill, with the Governor appointing 2 members;
1155 rather than 5 members in the bill. The amendment also directs the President of the Senate
1166 and the Speaker of the House of Representatives to appoint one member to the commission.
17 Current law provides that if a board of county commissioners fails to appoint a member
18 to the commission within 90 days of a vacancy on the commission to be filled by that
19 county, the Governor is required to appoint a resident of that county meeting certain criteria
20 to fill that vacancy. The bill changes the number of days to 30; the amendment strikes the
21 change in the bill and retains current law.
22 The amendment adds qualifications to be considered by the Governor when appointing
23 members to the commission. The amendment removes from the bill a membership term
24 limit of 2 consecutive 4-year terms. The amendment also removes from the bill the
25 provision relating to staggered terms.
2266 The amendment also strikes the requirement in the bill that the Secretary of State
2277 include information about the members of the commission in the Secretary of State's annual
2288 report on board appointments.
