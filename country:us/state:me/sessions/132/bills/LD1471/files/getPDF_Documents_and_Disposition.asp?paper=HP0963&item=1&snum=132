11 4. Failure to meet insulation standards. Beginning January 1, 2035, a tenant under

20 monthly heating bill from the landlord until the insulation standards of the tenant's
21 dwelling unit under Title 35-A, section 10117, subsection 2 are met. If the tenant's
22 utility bill for the dwelling unit's heat includes charges for other uses or services, the

29 subsection 4, paragraph B if the landlord demonstrates that meeting the insulation standard
