5 A. That the filing under this subsection is within a reasonable amount of time based
6 upon the underlying circumstances; or

8 prior motion to extend because of the inability to serve the defendant.
9 If the court makes a finding for the plaintiff under paragraph A or B, the court shall follow
10 subsection 1 to determine whether an extension of the final protection order is necessary to
