2 Sec. 1. 20-A MRSA §5205, sub-§6, ¶C, as enacted by PL 1981, c. 693, §§5 and

4 Sec. 2. 20-A MRSA §5205, sub-§6, ¶C-1 is enacted to read:
5 C-1. A transfer approved under this subsection must continue to be considered in the
6 best interest of the student and must be automatically renewed on an annual basis unless
7 the superintendent of the school administrative unit to which the student transferred
8 determines that:
9 (1) The student's attendance is irregular;
10 (2) The student is disruptive in class, at school or at school activities;
11 (3) The student does not use best efforts to succeed in class; or
12 (4) Based on the available facts, data and evidence, the transfer is no longer in the

14 If a superintendent makes a determination under this paragraph, the superintendent of
15 the school administrative unit from which the student transferred and the
16 superintendent of the school administrative unit to which the student transferred shall
17 review the transfer and the transfer may be discontinued. If a determination is made to
18 discontinue the transfer, the superintendent of the school administrative unit to which
19 the student was transferred shall notify the student and the student's parent of the
20 determination and the facts, evidence and data used to make the determination. At the
21 request of a parent, a determination to discontinue the transfer may be reviewed by the

23 SUMMARY
2244 This bill repeals the provision in current law requiring superintendents to annually
2255 review transfers of students to a school administrative unit other than the one in which the
2266 student has permanent residence. The bill provides that such transfers must be
2277 automatically renewed on an annual basis unless a superintendent determines that the
2288 student's attendance is irregular, the student is disruptive, the student does not use best
2299 efforts to succeed in class or the transfer is no longer in the best interest of the student.
