1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, many individuals affected by exposure to harmful chemicals at the
4 Canadian military support base in Gagetown, New Brunswick are suffering from illnesses
5 that shorten life expectancy, and others are already deceased; and
6 Whereas, there have been numerous previous attempts to gather reliable data and to
7 secure the recognition and help these individuals deserve, and these attempts have failed;
8 and
9 Whereas, expedient action is necessary to help those most immediately affected and
10 to ensure that the necessary recognition and supports are in place for those who have been
11 exposed to harmful chemicals at the base but who are not yet aware of the effects of that
12 exposure on their health; and
13 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
14 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
15 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
16 therefore,
17 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
18 Sec. 1. 37-B MRSA ยง518 is enacted to read:
