9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 580, L.D. 915, “An Act to Modernize
10 Deed Duplication from Microfilm to a Digital Image”
11 Amend the bill in section 1 in the indented paragraph in the 3rd line (page 1, line 6 in
12 L.D.) by striking out the following: "stored in a fireproof area" and inserting the following:
13 'stored in a fireproof area and'
14 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section
15 number to read consecutively.
16 SUMMARY
1177 This amendment amends the bill by retaining the requirement under current law that a
1188 record of each page of every installment, plan or other document recorded in the registry
1199 office must be stored in a fireproof area.
20 The preliminary fiscal impact statement identifies a potential unfunded state mandate
21 in the requirement of counties to make records of instruments recorded in the register of
22 deeds office in the form of digital images stored on magnetic or optical media, not on
23 microfilm as in current law.
24 The committee reviewed the preliminary fiscal impact statement in consultation with
25 the Secretary of State's office and determined that because registries of deeds are already
26 required to pay to put their records on microfilm and that because the requirement in the
27 bill to store a record as a digital image on magnetic or optical media instead of microfilm
28 as in current law would be a shift in cost rather than an additional cost, the bill does not
29 require an expansion or modification of activities so as to necessitate additional
30 expenditures.
