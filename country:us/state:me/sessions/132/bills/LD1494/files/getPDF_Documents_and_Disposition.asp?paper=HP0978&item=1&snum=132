1 Sec. 1. Adapting procurement program to climate action plan. Resolved:
2 That the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Office of Procurement
3 Services, referred to in this resolve as "the office," shall coordinate with all executive
4 branch departments, agencies, offices, boards and commissions and all quasi-independent
5 agencies, boards, commissions, authorities and institutions, as well as with the legislative
6 branch and the judicial branch, referred to in this resolve as "agencies," to study adapting
7 the State's procurement program to the state climate action plan under the Maine Revised
8 Statutes, Title 38, section 577, referred to in this resolve as "the climate action plan." The
9 office shall survey the past 3 fiscal years of requests for proposals.
10 The office shall include in its survey:
11 1. An assessment of the volume and percentage of procurements for goods and services
12 that provide an opportunity to consider the climate change impact of the deliverables of the
13 requests for proposals and the volume and percentage of procurements that provide no such
14 opportunity;
15 2. A determination and quantification of the extent to which agencies have already
16 adapted the deliverables of their requests for proposals over the past 3 fiscal years to the
17 climate action plan;
18 3. A review of agencies identifying the opportunities they may have missed to consider
19 the greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals under the climate action plan when initiating
20 bids for goods and services; and
21 4. A review of agencies identifying potential issues based upon their experience with
22 the procurement process and knowledge of what goods and services they commonly
23 contract for.
24 Using the results of its survey, the office shall develop a report and recommendations,
25 including recommendations to change the State's procurement laws, for how best to
26 incorporate the goals of the climate action plan as priorities in the State's procurement
27 program, allowing for exceptions or waivers as are reasonable and appropriate.
28 Sec. 2. Report. Resolved: That, no later than December 3, 2025, the office shall
29 report on its findings and recommendations under section 1, including any suggested
30 legislation, to the Joint Standing Committee on State and Local Government. The joint
31 standing committee may report out a bill related to the report to the Second Regular Session
32 of the 132nd Legislature.
