Procurement Process to the State Climate Action Plan
Sec. 1. Adapting procurement program to climate action plan. Resolved:
That the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Office of Procurement
Services, referred to in this resolve as "the office," shall coordinate with all executive
branch departments, agencies, offices, boards and commissions, referred to in this resolve
as "agencies," to study adapting the State's procurement program to the state climate action
plan under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 38, section 577, referred to in this resolve as
"the climate action plan." The office shall exclude from the study procurements conducted
by the Public Utilities Commission for energy or transmission infrastructure pursuant to
Title 35-A. The office shall survey the past 3 fiscal years of requests for proposals.
The office shall include in its survey:

Section 2:
1. An assessment of the volume and percentage of procurements for goods and services
that provide an opportunity to consider the climate change impact of the deliverables of the
requests for proposals and the volume and percentage of procurements that provide no such
opportunity;

Section 3:
2. A determination and quantification of the extent to which agencies have already
adapted the deliverables of their requests for proposals over the past 3 fiscal years to the
climate action plan;

Section 4:
3. A review of agencies identifying the opportunities they may have missed to consider
the greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals under the climate action plan when initiating
bids for goods and services; and

Section 5:
4. A review of agencies identifying potential issues based upon their experience with
the procurement process and knowledge of what goods and services they commonly
contract for.
Using the results of its survey, the office shall develop a report and recommendations,
including recommendations to change the State's procurement laws, for how best to
incorporate the goals of the climate action plan as priorities in the State's procurement
program, allowing for exceptions or waivers as are reasonable and appropriate.
