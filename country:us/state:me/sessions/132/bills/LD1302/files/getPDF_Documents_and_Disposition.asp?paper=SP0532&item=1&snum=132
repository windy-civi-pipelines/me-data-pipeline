1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 30-A MRSA §7202, first ¶, as amended by PL 2003, c. 297, §1, is further
3 amended to read:
4 The voters of any municipality may petition for consideration of deorganization of the

6 written petition of a number of voters equal to at least 50% of the number of votes cast in
7 the municipality at the last gubernatorial election, but in no case less than 10, requesting a
8 municipal meeting for the purpose of discussing and determining whether the municipality
9 should deorganize, the municipal officers shall call and hold a special meeting in the
10 manner provided for the calling and holding of town meetings or city elections to discuss
11 deorganization of the municipality and to decide whether to develop a deorganization

13 SUMMARY
1144 This bill modifies the provision of law governing voter petition for the deorganization
1155 of a municipality. Current law requires a written petition of a number of voters equal to at
1166 least 50% of the number of votes cast in the municipality at the last gubernatorial election,
1177 but not fewer than 10 voters, to request a municipal meeting to discuss and determine
1188 whether the municipality should deorganize. The bill removes the limitation that the
1199 petition must be signed by at least 10 voters.
