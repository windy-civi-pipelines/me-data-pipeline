6 premiums. All compensation remitted by or on behalf of a pharmaceutical manufacturer,
7 developer or labeler, directly or indirectly, to a carrier, or to a pharmacy benefits manager
8 under contract with a carrier, related to its prescription drug benefits must be: remitted

13 A. Remitted directly to the covered person at the point of sale to reduce the out-of-
14 pocket cost to the covered person associated with a particular prescription drug; or

28 manufacturers must offer to covered entities or to apply to any covered entity under 42
29 United States Code, Section 256b.
30 SUMMARY
3311 This bill removes a provision that requires that compensation remitted by or on behalf
3322 of a pharmaceutical manufacturer, developer or labeler to a pharmacy benefits manager be
3333 remitted to the carrier if it is not remitted to the covered person. It retains the provision that
3344 requires that the compensation be remitted to the covered person to reduce the out-of-
3355 pocket costs associated with a prescription drug. It requires pharmacy benefits managers
3366 to annually report compliance with this requirement to the Superintendent of Insurance. It
3377 authorizes the superintendent to impose civil penalties and take enforcement action for
3388 noncompliance by a carrier or pharmacy benefits manager. It designates the information
3399 provided as confidential.
