1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, current law does not prohibit the ownership or control of the State's critical
4 public utility service providers by entities providing aid to foreign terrorist organizations;
5 and
6 Whereas, an entity influenced by those who provide aid to foreign terrorist
7 organizations is too dangerous to operate in the State; and
8 Whereas, immediate action is necessary to ensure the safety and reliability of utility
9 services relied upon by all residents of the State; and
10 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
11 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
12 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
13 therefore,
14 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:

16 A-1. The commission may not approve a reorganization pursuant to this section if the
17 reorganization would result in the ownership of 6% or more or control of a public utility
18 or the parent company of a public utility by an entity that the commission finds has
19 provided material aid or comfort to an organization that is designated by the United
20 States Secretary of State as a foreign terrorist organization in accordance with the
21 United States Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 219.
22 Sec. 2. 35-A MRSA §720 is enacted to read:
