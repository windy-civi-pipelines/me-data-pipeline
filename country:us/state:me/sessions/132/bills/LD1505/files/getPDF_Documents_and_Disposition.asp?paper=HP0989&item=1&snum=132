7 percentage point until the rate of tax imposed for that category of tangible personal
8 property, products transferred electronically or taxable service is 0%. The assessor,
9 beginning December 1, 2025, and every 2 years thereafter, shall publish on the bureau's
10 publicly accessible website the rate of tax to be imposed on each category of tangible
11 personal property, products transferred electronically and taxable service taxed pursuant to
12 subsection 1 that is in effect the January 1st following the publication. The assessor,
13 concurrent with that publication, shall submit a bill to the joint standing committee of the
14 Legislature having jurisdiction over taxation matters indicating the reduced rates pursuant
15 to this subsection and any other changes necessitated by the reduction or elimination of the
16 tax imposed pursuant to this section. The joint standing committee shall report out a bill
17 making the necessary statutory changes.
18 SUMMARY
1199 This bill phases out the tax imposed on the sale of tangible personal property, products
2200 transferred electronically and taxable services by reducing the tax rate by 1/2 of a
2211 percentage point every 2 years, beginning January 1, 2026, until the rate is 0% for each
2222 category of tangible personal property, products transferred electronically or taxable
2233 service subject to sales tax. Since use taxes are based on the sales tax rate, use tax rates
2244 will also be decreased a commensurate amount.
25 The bill also requires the State Tax Assessor, the month before a decrease is scheduled
26 to take effect, to publish on the bureau's publicly accessible website the new rates and to
27 submit a bill to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over
28 taxation matters making the statutory changes necessitated by the decreased rates.
