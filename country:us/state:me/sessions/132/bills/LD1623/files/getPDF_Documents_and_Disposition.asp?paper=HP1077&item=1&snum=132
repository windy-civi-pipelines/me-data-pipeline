17 oversized ATV, the new owner may also register that oversized ATV upon payment of the

21 solely in a business activity, other than a business activity involving recreational use of the
22 oversized ATV. For purposes of this subsection, "oversized ATV" means an ATV that is

28 without the permission of the landowner or, lessee or landowner's representative.
29 Permission is presumed on designated state-approved ATV trails or in areas open to ATVs
30 by landowner policy. A landowner or, lessee or landowner's representative may limit the
31 use of a designated state-approved ATV trail on that landowner's or lessee's property
32 through agreements with the State or an ATV club to address environmental, public safety
33 or management concerns, including by limiting the type, size and weight of ATVs
34 permitted on the landowner's or lessee's property. A person operating an ATV, including
35 an oversized ATV, on designated state-approved ATV trails shall adhere to limitations
36 imposed by a landowner or, lessee or landowner's representative and the State on that part
37 of the designated state-approved ATV trail on the landowner's or lessee's property in
38 accordance with this subsection. Written permission of the landowner or, lessee or
39 landowner's representative is required for use of an ATV on cropland or pastureland or in

41 of a designated state-approved ATV trail on that landowner's or lessee's property. As used
42 in this subsection, "cropland" means acreage in tillage rotation, land being cropped and
43 land in bush fruits and "pastureland" means acreage devoted to the production of forage
44 plants used for animal production. For purposes of this subsection, "oversized ATV" has
Page 2 - 132LR1540(01)

415 the same meaning as defined in section 13155, subsection 5‑B. Nothing in this This
426 subsection may not be construed to limit or expand a landowner's or lessee's property rights.
3 A. A person who violates this subsection commits a civil violation for which a fine of
4 not less than $100 or more than $500 may be adjudged.
5 B. A person who violates this subsection after having been adjudicated of having
6 committed 3 or more civil violations under this Part within the previous 5-year period

9 and affected by §422, is amended to read:
10 2. Stop and identify requirement. Persons operating ATVs upon the land of another
11 shall stop and identify themselves upon the request of the landowner, lessee or the
12 landowner's duly authorized representative. A person who violates this subsection commits
13 a Class E crime.
14 Sec. 7. 12 MRSA §13157-A, sub-§27, ¶A, as enacted by PL 2005, c. 397, Pt. E,
15 §26 and amended by PL 2011, c. 657, Pt. W, §5, is further amended by amending
16 subparagraph (2) in the first blocked paragraph to read:
17 The provisions of this subparagraph do not apply to a trail designated for ATV use
18 by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. The provisions of
19 this subparagraph also do not apply to a person accessing land for maintenance or
20 inspection purposes with the landowner's permission or the landowner's
21 representative's permission or to local, state or federal government personnel in the
22 performance of official duties, provided as long as there is no significant ground
23 disturbance or sedimentation of water bodies.
24 Sec. 8. 33 MRSA §2001, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 382, §1, is amended to read:
25 §2001. Placement of cameras and electronic surveillance equipment on private
26 property
