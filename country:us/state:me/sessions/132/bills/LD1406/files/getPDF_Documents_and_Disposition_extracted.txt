3 Whereas, this legislation needs to take effect before the expiration of the 90-day
4 period in order to apply to cases of abuse or neglect of a child or jeopardy to health or
5 welfare of a child as soon as possible; and
6 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
7 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
8 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
9 therefore,
10 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
11 Sec. 1. 22 MRSA §4002, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2021, c. 176, §1, is further
12 amended to read:
13 1. Abuse or neglect. "Abuse or neglect" means a threat to a child's health or welfare
14 by physical, mental or emotional injury or impairment, or sexual abuse or exploitation
15 including under Title 17‑A, sections 282, 852, 853 and 855 or deprivation of essential
16 needs, or lack of protection from these, by a person responsible for the child. "Abuse or
17 neglect" also means serious harm or threat of serious harm by a person responsible for the
18 child due to inadequate care or supervision of the child or deprivation of food, clothing,
19 shelter, education or medical care necessary for the child's health or welfare by that person
20 when that person is financially able to provide food, clothing, shelter, education or medical
21 care necessary for the child's health or welfare or is offered reasonable financial means or
22 other means to do so. "Abuse or neglect" also means truancy under Title 20‑A, section
23 3272, subsection 2, paragraph C or section 5051‑A, subsection 1, paragraph C or D when
24 truancy is the result of neglect by a person responsible for the child. "Abuse or neglect"
25 also means a threat to a child's health or welfare caused by child sex trafficking by any
26 person, regardless of whether or not the person is responsible for the child.
27 Sec. 2. 22 MRSA §4002, sub-§6, ¶B, as amended by PL 2021, c. 176, §3, is further
28 amended to read:
29 B. Deprivation of adequate food, clothing, shelter, supervision or care by the person
30 responsible for the child when that person is financially able to provide adequate food,
31 clothing, shelter, supervision or care or is offered reasonable financial means or other
32 means to do so;
33 Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation
34 takes effect when approved.
35 SUMMARY
3366 This bill changes the definitions of "abuse or neglect" and "jeopardy to health or
3377 welfare" in the Child and Family Services and Child Protection Act. It provides that "abuse
3388 or neglect" also means serious harm or threat of serious harm by a person responsible for
3399 the child due to inadequate care or supervision of the child or deprivation of food, clothing,
4400 shelter, education or medical care necessary for the child's health or welfare by that person
4411 when that person is financially able to provide food, clothing, shelter, education or medical
4422 care necessary for the child's health or welfare or is offered reasonable financial means or
Page 1 - 132LR1322(01)
413 other means to do so. It removes from the definition of "abuse or neglect" the lack of
424 protection from specified threats to a child's health or welfare by a person responsible for
435 the child. It provides that "jeopardy to health or welfare" means serious abuse or neglect
446 as evidenced by deprivation of adequate food, clothing, shelter, supervision or care by the
457 person responsible for the child when that person is financially able to provide adequate
468 food, clothing, shelter, supervision or care or is offered reasonable financial means or other
479 means to do so.
