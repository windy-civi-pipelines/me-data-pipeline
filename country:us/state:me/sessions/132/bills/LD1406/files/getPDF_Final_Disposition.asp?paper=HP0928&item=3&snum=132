An Act to Amend Certain Definitions in the Child and Family Services and
Child Protection Act
Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, this legislation needs to take effect before the expiration of the 90-day
period in order to apply to cases of abuse or neglect of a child or jeopardy to health or
welfare of a child as soon as possible; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore,
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
Sec. 1. 22 MRSA §4002, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2021, c. 176, §1, is further
amended to read:
1. Abuse or neglect. "Abuse or neglect" means a threat to a child's health or welfare
by physical, mental or emotional injury or impairment, or sexual abuse or exploitation
including under Title 17‑A, sections 282, 852, 853 and 855 or deprivation of essential
needs, or lack of protection from these, by a person responsible for the child. "Abuse or
neglect" also means serious harm or threat of serious harm by a person responsible for the
child due to inadequate care or supervision of the child or deprivation of food, clothing,
shelter, education or medical care necessary for the child's health or welfare by that person
when that person is financially able to provide food, clothing, shelter, education or medical
care necessary for the child's health or welfare or is offered lawful and reasonable financial
means or resources to do so. "Abuse or neglect" also means truancy under Title 20‑A,
section 3272, subsection 2, paragraph C or section 5051‑A, subsection 1, paragraph C or D
when truancy is the result of neglect by a person responsible for the child. "Abuse or
neglect" also means a threat to a child's health or welfare caused by child sex trafficking
by any person, regardless of whether or not the person is responsible for the child.
