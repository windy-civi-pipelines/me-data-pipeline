Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, there are currently intoxicating hemp products for sale in this State for
which there is no legal restriction preventing sale to minor children; and
Whereas, some of those products may be designed or packaged in a manner that a
person, including a child, could potentially be led to confuse the intoxicating products for
nonintoxicating products typically marketed to children, such as gummies or similar
products; and
Whereas, ingestion of intoxicating hemp products by a child can cause harm to the
child; and
Whereas, it is in the interest of child safety for the restrictions directed by this
legislation to go into effect as soon as possible; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore,
