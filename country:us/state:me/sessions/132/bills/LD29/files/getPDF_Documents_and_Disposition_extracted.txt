2 the Department of Transportation to seek legislative approval for any conversion of a state-

16 or paved bicycle and pedestrian trail; and
17 Whereas, the State Railroad Preservation and Assistance Act further requires that,
18 once the Commissioner of Transportation receives a report from a rail corridor use advisory
19 council that includes a recommendation of track removal or other change for interim

21 seek legislative approval of the recommendation by submitting legislation to the joint
22 standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over transportation matters prior
23 to the track removal or other change for interim nonrail use; and
24 Whereas, any track removal or other change for nonrail use is considered interim in
25 nature and rail corridors are to be preserved for future rail use as provided under the State
26 Railroad Preservation and Assistance Act; now, therefore, be it
27 Sec. 1. Trail construction on Lower Road. Resolved: That, based on the
28 majority recommendation of the Lower Road Rail Use Advisory Council and pursuant to
