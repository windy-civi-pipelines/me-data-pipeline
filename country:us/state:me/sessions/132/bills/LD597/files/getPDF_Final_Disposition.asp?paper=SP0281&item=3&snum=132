S.P. 281 - L.D. 597
An Act to Direct the Public Utilities Commission to Conduct Procurements
for Energy or Renewable Energy Credits
Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, it is critically important that Maine citizens have continued access to low-
cost, locally generated power through the timely procurement of long-term contracts
administered by the Public Utilities Commission; and
Whereas, delays in the procurement process will jeopardize rural jobs in the forest
products industry and place at risk applications to connect in a cost-effective manner to the
New England grid unless the Public Utilities Commission acts prior to the expiration of the
90-day period; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore,
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
Sec. 1. 35-A MRSA §3149 is enacted to read:
§3149. Negative pricing
The commission may not approve a contract for energy resulting from a competitive
solicitation conducted by the commission under this Title unless the contract includes a
provision that requires the reduction of payments to the bidder by the stranded costs arising
from energy produced during negative price intervals. The commission may grant an
exception from the inclusion of such a negative price provision if the bidder demonstrates
good cause for the exception and the commission finds that the contract is cost-effective,
includes other price protections for ratepayers and will avoid to the maximum extent
possible the curtailment of existing renewable resource generators.
Sec. 2. 35-A MRSA §3210, sub-§12, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 321, §2, is
repealed.
