14 §90-A. Licensing actions
15 1. Disciplinary proceedings and sanctions. The licensing board or, as delegated, its
16 subcommittee or staff, shall investigate a complaint on its own motion or upon receipt of a
17 written complaint filed with the licensing board regarding noncompliance with or violation
18 of this chapter or of any rules adopted by the board. Investigation may include an informal
19 conference before the board, its subcommittee or staff to determine whether grounds exist
20 for suspension, revocation or denial of a license or for taking other disciplinary action
21 pursuant to this chapter. The licensing board, its subcommittee or its staff may subpoena
22 witnesses, records and documents, including records and documents maintained by a health
23 care facility or other service organization or person related to the delivery of emergency
24 medical services, in any investigation or hearing it conducts.
25 2. Notice. The licensing board shall notify the licensee of the content of a complaint
26 filed against the licensee as soon as possible, but in no event later than 60 days after the
27 licensing board or its staff receives the initial pertinent information. The licensee has the
28 right to respond within 30 days in all cases except those involving an emergency denial,
29 suspension or revocation, as described in the Maine Administrative Procedure Act, Title 5,
30 chapter 375, subchapter 5. If the licensee's response to the complaint satisfies the licensing
31 board or its staff that the complaint does not merit further investigation or action, the matter
32 may be dismissed, with notice of the dismissal to the complainant, if any.
33 3. Informal conference. If, in the opinion of the board, its subcommittee or staff, the
34 factual basis of the complaint is or may be true and the complaint is of sufficient gravity to
35 warrant further action, the board or staff may request an informal conference with the
36 licensee. The board shall provide the licensee with adequate notice of the conference and
37 of the issues to be discussed. The conference must be conducted in executive session of
38 the board, subcommittee or staff, pursuant to Title 1, section 405, unless otherwise
39 requested by the licensee. Statements made at the conference may not be introduced at a
40 subsequent formal administrative or judicial hearing unless all parties consent. The
41 licensee may, without prejudice, refuse to participate in an informal conference if the
42 licensee prefers to request an adjudicatory hearing. If the licensee participates in the
43 informal conference, the licensee waives the right to object to a participant at the hearing
44 who participated at the informal conference.
Page 4 - 132LR0301(01)

1 4. Further action. If the licensing board, its subcommittee or its staff finds that the
2 factual basis of the complaint is true and is of sufficient gravity to warrant further action,
3 it may take any of the following actions.
4 A. The licensing board, its subcommittee or its staff may negotiate a consent
5 agreement with the licensee that fixes the period and terms of probation necessary to
6 protect the public health and safety and to rehabilitate or educate the licensee. A
7 consent agreement may be used to terminate a complaint investigation, if entered into
8 by the licensing board or its staff, the licensee and the Department of the Attorney
9 General.
10 B. If a licensee voluntarily surrenders a license, the licensing board, its subcommittee
11 or its staff may negotiate stipulations necessary to ensure protection of the public health
12 and safety and the rehabilitation or education of the licensee. These stipulations may
13 be set forth only in a consent agreement signed by the licensing board or its staff, the
14 licensee and the Department of the Attorney General.
15 C. If the licensing board, its subcommittee or its staff concludes that modification,
16 nonrenewal or suspension pursuant to section 88, subsection 3 subsection 7 of a license
17 or imposition of a civil penalty pursuant to section 88, subsection 3 subsection 7 is in
18 order, the licensing board shall so notify the licensee and inform the licensee of the
19 licensee's right to request an adjudicatory hearing. If the licensee requests an
20 adjudicatory hearing in a timely manner, the adjudicatory hearing must be held by the
21 licensing board in accordance with Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 4. If the licensee
22 wishes to appeal the final decision of the licensing board, the licensee shall file a
23 petition for review with the Superior Court within 30 days of receipt of the licensing
24 board's decision. Review under this paragraph must be conducted pursuant to Title 5,
25 chapter 375, subchapter 7.
26 D. Except in the specific circumstances where for which Title 5, section 10004 may
27 be invoked, if the licensing board or its staff concludes that suspension beyond the
28 authority conferred by section 88 and subsection 7 of the license is in order, the
29 licensing board or its staff shall request the Attorney General to file a complaint in the
30 District Court in accordance with Title 4, chapter 5 and the Maine Administrative
31 Procedure Act to commence either full or emergency proceedings.
32 5. Grounds for licensing action. A decision to take action against any applicant or
33 licensee pursuant to this chapter or any rules adopted pursuant to this chapter, including,
34 but not limited to, a decision to impose a civil penalty or to refuse to issue or renew a license
35 or to modify, suspend or revoke a license of a person, service or vehicle, may be predicated
36 on the following grounds:
37 A. Fraud or deceit in obtaining a license under this chapter or in connection with
38 service rendered within the scope of the license issued;
39 B-1. The use of any drug, narcotic or substance that is illegal under state or federal
40 law, or to the extent that the licensee's ability to provide emergency medical services
41 or emergency medical dispatch services would be impaired;
42 B-2. A declaration of or claim pertaining to the licensee of legal incompetence that
43 has not been legally terminated;
Page 5 - 132LR0301(01)

1 B-3. Any condition or impairment within the preceding 3 years, including, but not
2 limited to, substance use disorder or a mental, emotional or nervous disorder or
3 condition, that in any way affects, or if untreated could impair, the licensee's ability to
4 provide emergency medical services or emergency medical dispatch services;
5 D. Aiding or abetting the practice of emergency care by a person not duly licensed
6 under this chapter who purports to be so;
7 E. Incompetent professional practice as evidenced by:
8 (1) Demonstrated inability to respond appropriately to a client, patient or the
9 general public; or
10 (2) Inability to apply principles, skills or knowledge necessary to successfully
11 carry out the practice for which the licensee is licensed;
12 F. Violation of any reasonable standard of professional behavior, conduct or practice
13 that has been established in the practice for which the licensee is licensed;
14 G. Subject to the limitations of Title 5, chapter 341, conviction of a crime that involves
15 dishonesty or false statement, conviction of a crime that relates directly to the practice
16 for which the licensee is licensed, conviction of a crime for which incarceration for one
17 year or more may be imposed or conviction of a crime defined in Title 17‑A, chapter
18 11, 12 or 45;
19 H. Any violation of this chapter or any rule adopted by the board or the licensing
20 board; or
21 I. For other purposes as specified by rules or law.
22 6. Notice of action. In any proceeding under this section with regard to an ambulance
23 service owned and operated by a municipality or a private ambulance service with which a
24 municipality contracts for services, if the licensing board or its staff takes further licensing
25 action under subsection 4, the licensing board shall notify in writing the town manager or
26 city manager and the municipal officers of the municipality that owns and operates or
27 contracts with the ambulance service within 5 business days of taking the action.
28 7. Authority. In addition to authority otherwise conferred, the licensing board or, as
29 delegated, its staff may, for each violation of applicable laws, rules or conditions of
30 licensure or registration, in accordance with the procedures established in this section and
31 any rules adopted by the board, take one or more of the following actions:
32 A. Issue warnings, censures or reprimands to a licensee, deny or refuse to renew a
33 license and suspend or revoke a license. Each warning, censure, reprimand and
34 revocation issued must be based upon violations of different applicable laws, rules or
35 conditions of licensure or must be based upon separate instances of actionable conduct
36 or activity;
37 B. Suspend a license or registration for up to 90 days for each violation of applicable
38 laws, rules and conditions of licensure or registration or for each instance of actionable
39 conduct or activity. Suspensions may be set to run concurrently or consecutively.
40 Execution of all or any portion of a term of suspension may be stayed pending
41 successful completion of conditions of probation, although the suspension remains part
42 of the licensee's record;
Page 6 - 132LR0301(01)

1 C. Impose civil penalties of up to $1,500 for each violation of applicable laws, rules
2 and conditions of licensure or for each instance of actionable conduct or activity;
3 D. Impose conditions of probation upon an applicant or licensee. Probation may run
4 for that time period as the licensing board or its staff determines appropriate. Probation
5 may include conditions such as: additional continuing education; medical, psychiatric
6 or mental health consultations or evaluations; mandatory professional or occupational
7 supervision of the applicant or licensee; and other conditions as the licensing board or
8 its staff determines appropriate. Costs incurred in the performance of terms of
9 probation are borne by the applicant or licensee. Failure to comply with the conditions
10 of probation is a ground for disciplinary action against a licensee;
11 E. Execute a consent agreement that resolves a complaint or investigation without
12 further proceedings. Consent agreements may be entered into only with the consent of
13 the applicant or licensee, the licensing board or its staff and the Department of the
14 Attorney General. Any remedy, penalty or fine or cost recovery that is otherwise
15 available by law, even if only in the jurisdiction of the District Court, may be achieved
16 by consent agreement, including long-term suspension and permanent revocation of a
17 professional license. A consent agreement is not subject to review or appeal and may
18 be modified only by a writing executed by all parties to the original consent agreement.
19 A consent agreement is enforceable by an action in Superior Court; or
20 F. Assess a licensee the costs of investigation and adjudicatory hearings relating to
21 that licensee.
22 8. Authority to issue letters of guidance. In addition to authority otherwise
23 conferred, the licensing board or, as delegated, its staff may issue a letter of guidance or
24 concern to an applicant or licensee.
25 A letter of guidance or concern may be used to educate, reinforce knowledge regarding
26 legal or professional obligations and express concern over action or inaction by the licensee
27 or applicant that does not rise to the level of misconduct sufficient to merit disciplinary
28 action. The issuance of a letter of guidance or concern is not a formal proceeding and does
29 not constitute an adverse disciplinary action of any form. Notwithstanding any other
30 provision of law, a letter of guidance or concern is not confidential. The licensing board
31 or, as delegated, its staff may place a letter of guidance or concern, together with any
32 underlying complaint, report and investigation materials, in a licensee's or applicant's file
33 for a specified amount of time, not to exceed 10 years. Any letters, complaints and
34 materials placed on file may be accessed and considered by the licensing board or its staff
35 in any subsequent action commenced against the applicant or licensee within the specified
36 time frame.
37 9. Authority to request mental and physical examinations. For the purposes of this
38 subsection, by application for and acceptance of a license to practice, an emergency
39 medical services person is considered to have given consent to a mental or physical
40 examination when directed by the licensing board. The licensing board may direct an
41 emergency medical services person to submit to an examination whenever the licensing
42 board determines the emergency medical services person may be suffering from a mental
43 illness that may be interfering with the competent practice of emergency medical services
44 or from the use of intoxicants or drugs to an extent that they are preventing the emergency
45 medical services person from practicing competently and with safety to patients. An
Page 7 - 132LR0301(01)

416 emergency medical services person examined pursuant to an order of the licensing board
427 may not prevent the testimony of the examining individual or prevent the acceptance into
438 evidence of the report of an examining individual in a proceeding under subsection 1.
449 Failure to comply with an order of the licensing board to submit to a mental or physical
550 examination results in the immediate suspension of the license of the emergency medical
561 services person until the emergency medical services person submits to the examination.
7 10. Appeals of nondisciplinary actions and refusals to issue. Any person or
8 organization aggrieved by the decision of the staff of the licensing board in taking any
9 nondisciplinary action pursuant to this chapter or rules adopted pursuant to this chapter or
10 in the interpretation of this chapter or rules adopted pursuant to this chapter or in refusing
11 to issue a license may appeal the decision to the licensing board for a final decision. The
12 staff's decision stands until the licensing board issues a decision to uphold, modify or
13 overrule the staff's decision. In the case of nonrenewal, the person or organization must be
14 afforded an opportunity for hearing in accordance with this chapter and the Maine
15 Administrative Procedure Act. A final decision of the licensing board constitutes final
16 agency action appealable pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 7.
17 Sec. 18. 32 MRSA §90-C, as enacted by PL 2015, c. 82, §7, is amended to read:
18 §90-C. Duty of all licensees and applicants for licensure to report certain information

20 notify the licensing board in writing within 10 days of a:
21 A. Change of name or address;
22 B. Criminal conviction;
23 C. Revocation, suspension or other disciplinary action taken in this or any other
24 jurisdiction against any occupational or professional license held by the applicant or
25 licensee; or
26 D. Material change in the conditions or qualifications set forth in the original
27 application for licensure submitted to the licensing board.

35 obtained by discovery from the committee, the board or its staff or the licensing board or
36 its staff. Quality assurance information may be disclosed to a licensee as part of any board-
37 approved educational or corrective process. All complaints and investigative records of
38 the licensing board or any committee or subcommittee of the board are confidential during
39 the pendency of an investigation and may not be disclosed by the committee, the licensing
40 board or its staff. Information or records that identify or permit identification of any patient
41 that appears in any reports, information or records provided to the licensing board or
42 department for the purposes of investigation are confidential and may not be disclosed by
43 the committee, the licensing board or its staff.

15 or employment to the applicant or licensee.
