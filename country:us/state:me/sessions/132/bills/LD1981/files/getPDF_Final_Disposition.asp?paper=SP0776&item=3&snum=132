§90-A. Licensing actions
1. Disciplinary proceedings and sanctions. The licensing board or, as delegated, its
subcommittee or staff, shall investigate a complaint on its own motion or upon receipt of a
written complaint filed with the licensing board regarding noncompliance with or violation
of this chapter or of any rules adopted by the board. Investigation may include an informal
conference before the board, its subcommittee or staff to determine whether grounds exist
for suspension, revocation or denial of a license or for taking other disciplinary action
pursuant to this chapter. The licensing board, its subcommittee or its staff may subpoena
witnesses, records and documents, including records and documents maintained by a health
care facility or other service organization or person related to the delivery of emergency
medical services, in any investigation or hearing it conducts.
2. Notice. The licensing board shall notify the licensee of the content of a complaint
filed against the licensee as soon as possible, but in no event later than 60 days after the
licensing board or its staff receives the initial pertinent information. The licensee has the
right to respond within 30 days in all cases except those involving an emergency denial,
suspension or revocation, as described in the Maine Administrative Procedure Act, Title 5,
Page 4 - 132LR0301(03)

chapter 375, subchapter 5. If the licensee's response to the complaint satisfies the licensing
board or its staff that the complaint does not merit further investigation or action, the matter
may be dismissed, with notice of the dismissal to the complainant, if any.
3. Informal conference. If, in the opinion of the board, its subcommittee or staff, the
factual basis of the complaint is or may be true and the complaint is of sufficient gravity to
warrant further action, the board or staff may request an informal conference with the
licensee. The board shall provide the licensee with adequate notice of the conference and
of the issues to be discussed. The conference must be conducted in executive session of
the board, subcommittee or staff, pursuant to Title 1, section 405, unless otherwise
requested by the licensee. Statements made at the conference may not be introduced at a
subsequent formal administrative or judicial hearing unless all parties consent. The
licensee may, without prejudice, refuse to participate in an informal conference if the
licensee prefers to request an adjudicatory hearing. If the licensee participates in the
informal conference, the licensee waives the right to object to a participant at the hearing
who participated at the informal conference.
4. Further action. If the licensing board, its subcommittee or its staff finds that the
factual basis of the complaint is true and is of sufficient gravity to warrant further action,
it may take any of the following actions.
A. The licensing board, its subcommittee or its staff may negotiate a consent
agreement with the licensee that fixes the period and terms of probation necessary to
protect the public health and safety and to rehabilitate or educate the licensee. A
consent agreement may be used to terminate a complaint investigation, if entered into
by the licensing board or its staff, the licensee and the Department of the Attorney
General.
B. If a licensee voluntarily surrenders a license, the licensing board, its subcommittee
or its staff may negotiate stipulations necessary to ensure protection of the public health
and safety and the rehabilitation or education of the licensee. These stipulations may
be set forth only in a consent agreement signed by the licensing board or its staff, the
licensee and the Department of the Attorney General.
C. If the licensing board, its subcommittee or its staff concludes that modification,
nonrenewal or suspension pursuant to section 88, subsection 3 subsection 7 of a license
or imposition of a civil penalty pursuant to section 88, subsection 3 subsection 7 is in
order, the licensing board shall so notify the licensee and inform the licensee of the
licensee's right to request an adjudicatory hearing. If the licensee requests an
adjudicatory hearing in a timely manner, the adjudicatory hearing must be held by the
licensing board in accordance with Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 4. If the licensee
wishes to appeal the final decision of the licensing board, the licensee shall file a
petition for review with the Superior Court within 30 days of receipt of the licensing
board's decision. Review under this paragraph must be conducted pursuant to Title 5,
chapter 375, subchapter 7.
D. Except in the specific circumstances where for which Title 5, section 10004 may
be invoked, if the licensing board or its staff concludes that suspension beyond the
authority conferred by section 88 and subsection 7 of the license is in order, the
licensing board or its staff shall request the Attorney General to file a complaint in the
Page 5 - 132LR0301(03)

District Court in accordance with Title 4, chapter 5 and the Maine Administrative
Procedure Act to commence either full or emergency proceedings.
5. Grounds for licensing action. A decision to take action against any applicant or
licensee pursuant to this chapter or any rules adopted pursuant to this chapter, including,
but not limited to, a decision to impose a civil penalty or to refuse to issue or renew a license
or to modify, suspend or revoke a license of a person, service or vehicle, may be predicated
on the following grounds:
A. Fraud or deceit in obtaining a license under this chapter or in connection with
service rendered within the scope of the license issued;
B-1. The use of any drug, narcotic or substance that is illegal under state or federal
law, or to the extent that the licensee's ability to provide emergency medical services
or emergency medical dispatch services would be impaired;
B-2. A declaration of or claim pertaining to the licensee of legal incompetence that
has not been legally terminated;
B-3. Any condition or impairment within the preceding 3 years, including, but not
limited to, substance use disorder or a mental, emotional or nervous disorder or
condition, that in any way affects, or if untreated could impair, the licensee's ability to
provide emergency medical services or emergency medical dispatch services;
D. Aiding or abetting the practice of emergency care by a person not duly licensed
under this chapter who purports to be so;
E. Incompetent professional practice as evidenced by:
(1) Demonstrated inability to respond appropriately to a client, patient or the
general public; or
(2) Inability to apply principles, skills or knowledge necessary to successfully
carry out the practice for which the licensee is licensed;
F. Violation of any reasonable standard of professional behavior, conduct or practice
that has been established in the practice for which the licensee is licensed;
G. Subject to the limitations of Title 5, chapter 341, conviction of a crime that involves
dishonesty or false statement, conviction of a crime that relates directly to the practice
for which the licensee is licensed, conviction of a crime for which incarceration for one
year or more may be imposed or conviction of a crime defined in Title 17‑A, chapter
11, 12 or 45;
H. Any violation of this chapter or any rule adopted by the board or the licensing
board; or
I. For other purposes as specified by rules or law.
6. Notice of action. In any proceeding under this section with regard to an ambulance
service owned and operated by a municipality or a private ambulance service with which a
municipality contracts for services, if the licensing board or its staff takes further licensing
action under subsection 4, the licensing board shall notify in writing the town manager or
city manager and the municipal officers of the municipality that owns and operates or
contracts with the ambulance service within 5 business days of taking the action.
Page 6 - 132LR0301(03)

7. Authority. In addition to authority otherwise conferred, the licensing board or, as
delegated, its staff may, for each violation of applicable laws, rules or conditions of
licensure or registration, in accordance with the procedures established in this section and
any rules adopted by the board, take one or more of the following actions:
A. Issue warnings, censures or reprimands to a licensee, deny or refuse to renew a
license and suspend or revoke a license. Each warning, censure, reprimand and
revocation issued must be based upon violations of different applicable laws, rules or
conditions of licensure or must be based upon separate instances of actionable conduct
or activity;
B. Suspend a license or registration for up to 90 days for each violation of applicable
laws, rules and conditions of licensure or registration or for each instance of actionable
conduct or activity. Suspensions may be set to run concurrently or consecutively.
Execution of all or any portion of a term of suspension may be stayed pending
successful completion of conditions of probation, although the suspension remains part
of the licensee's record;
C. Impose civil penalties of up to $1,500 for each violation of applicable laws, rules
and conditions of licensure or for each instance of actionable conduct or activity;
D. Impose conditions of probation upon an applicant or licensee. Probation may run
for that time period as the licensing board or its staff determines appropriate. Probation
may include conditions such as: additional continuing education; medical, psychiatric
or mental health consultations or evaluations; mandatory professional or occupational
supervision of the applicant or licensee; and other conditions as the licensing board or
its staff determines appropriate. Costs incurred in the performance of terms of
probation are borne by the applicant or licensee. Failure to comply with the conditions
of probation is a ground for disciplinary action against a licensee;
E. Execute a consent agreement that resolves a complaint or investigation without
further proceedings. Consent agreements may be entered into only with the consent of
the applicant or licensee, the licensing board or its staff and the Department of the
Attorney General. Any remedy, penalty or fine or cost recovery that is otherwise
available by law, even if only in the jurisdiction of the District Court, may be achieved
by consent agreement, including long-term suspension and permanent revocation of a
professional license. A consent agreement is not subject to review or appeal and may
be modified only by a writing executed by all parties to the original consent agreement.
A consent agreement is enforceable by an action in Superior Court; or
F. Assess a licensee the costs of investigation and adjudicatory hearings relating to
that licensee.
8. Authority to issue letters of guidance. In addition to authority otherwise
conferred, the licensing board or, as delegated, its staff may issue a letter of guidance or
concern to an applicant or licensee.
A letter of guidance or concern may be used to educate, reinforce knowledge regarding
legal or professional obligations and express concern over action or inaction by the licensee
or applicant that does not rise to the level of misconduct sufficient to merit disciplinary
action. The issuance of a letter of guidance or concern is not a formal proceeding and does
not constitute an adverse disciplinary action of any form. Notwithstanding any other
Page 7 - 132LR0301(03)

provision of law, a letter of guidance or concern is not confidential. The licensing board
or, as delegated, its staff may place a letter of guidance or concern, together with any
underlying complaint, report and investigation materials, in a licensee's or applicant's file
for a specified amount of time, not to exceed 10 years. Any letters, complaints and
materials placed on file may be accessed and considered by the licensing board or its staff
in any subsequent action commenced against the applicant or licensee within the specified
time frame.
9. Authority to request mental and physical examinations. For the purposes of this
subsection, by application for and acceptance of a license to practice, an emergency
medical services person is considered to have given consent to a mental or physical
examination when directed by the licensing board. The licensing board may direct an
emergency medical services person to submit to a mental examination whenever the
licensing board determines the emergency medical services person may be suffering from
a mental illness that may be interfering with the competent practice of emergency medical
services or from the use of intoxicants or drugs to an extent that they are preventing the
emergency medical services person from practicing competently and with safety to
patients. The licensing board may direct an emergency medical services person to submit
to a physical examination whenever the licensing board determines the emergency medical
services person may have diminished physical capabilities to an extent that they are
preventing the emergency medical services person from practicing competently and with
safety to patients. An emergency medical services person examined pursuant to an order
of the licensing board may not prevent the testimony of the examining individual or prevent
the acceptance into evidence of the report of an examining individual in a proceeding under
subsection 1. Failure to comply with an order of the licensing board to submit to a mental
or physical examination results in the immediate suspension of the license of the emergency
medical services person until the emergency medical services person submits to the
examination.
10. Appeals of nondisciplinary actions and refusals to issue. Any person or
organization aggrieved by the decision of the staff of the licensing board in taking any
nondisciplinary action pursuant to this chapter or rules adopted pursuant to this chapter or
in the interpretation of this chapter or rules adopted pursuant to this chapter or in refusing
to issue a license may appeal the decision to the licensing board for a final decision. The
staff's decision stands until the licensing board issues a decision to uphold, modify or
overrule the staff's decision. In the case of nonrenewal, the person or organization must be
afforded an opportunity for hearing in accordance with this chapter and the Maine
Administrative Procedure Act. A final decision of the licensing board constitutes final
agency action appealable pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 7.
Sec. 18. 32 MRSA §90-C, as enacted by PL 2015, c. 82, §7, is amended to read:
§90-C. Duty of all licensees and applicants for licensure to report certain information
