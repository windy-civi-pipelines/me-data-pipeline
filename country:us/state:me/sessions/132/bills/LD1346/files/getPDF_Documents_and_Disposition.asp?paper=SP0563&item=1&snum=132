1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not

3 Whereas, the New Sharon Water District has struggled to maintain consistent

5 Whereas, the current board of trustees and the select board of the Town of New
6 Sharon recognize that stability is necessary for ratepayers to be properly served; and
7 Whereas, this legislation must take effect before the expiration of the 90-day period
8 to authorize submission of the issue of dissolution of the New Sharon Water District to the
9 voters of the Town of New Sharon at the June 2025 primary; and
10 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
11 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as

9 assets and obligations of the New Sharon Water District to the Town of New Sharon
10 pursuant to this Act.
11 Sec. 6. Referendum; effective date. This Act takes effect when approved only
12 for the purpose of permitting its submission to the legal voters within the Town of New
13 Sharon at a referendum called for that purpose and held after March 1, 2025, but within 3
14 years after the effective date of this Act. The referendum must be called by the municipal
15 officers of the town and must be held at the town's regular voting places. The referendum
16 must be called, advertised and conducted according to the law relating to municipal
17 elections. The registrar shall make a complete list of all the eligible voters of the Town of

20 workday preceding the referendum. The subject matter of this Act is reduced to the
21 following question:
22 "Do you favor the New Sharon Water District turning over all assets,
23 liabilities and responsibilities to the Town of New Sharon for the purposes
24 of providing drinking water and fire protection to existing and future
25 customers?"
26 The voters shall indicate by a cross or check mark placed against the word "Yes" or
27 "No" their opinion of the same. The results must be declared by the municipal officers of
28 the Town of New Sharon and due certificate of the results filed by the clerk with the
29 Secretary of State. This Act takes effect for all other purposes immediately upon its
30 approval by a majority of the legal voters of the Town of New Sharon voting at the
31 referendum. Failure to achieve the necessary approval in any referendum does not prohibit
32 subsequent referenda consistent with this section, as long as the referenda are held within
33 3 years after the effective date of this Act. If, after March 1, 2025, but prior to approval of
34 this Act, a referendum on the question specified in this section is held in accordance with
35 this section and a majority of the legal voters of the Town of New Sharon voting at the
36 referendum cast votes in favor of the question and due certificate of the results are filed
37 with the Secretary of State, this Act takes effect when approved.
38 Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation
39 takes effect when approved.
