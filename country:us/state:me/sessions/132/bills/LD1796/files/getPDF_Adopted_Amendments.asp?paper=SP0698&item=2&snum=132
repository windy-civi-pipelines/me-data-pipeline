24 and reimburse the reasonable expenses of an attorney appointed under this subsection.
25 Sec. 5. 18-C MRSA §5-205, sub-§5, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 402, Pt. A, §2 and

570 whether there has been a substantial change in circumstances necessitating modification of
581 the order and how the court should modify the order in furtherance of the best interest of
592 the minor and the parent's rights. The court may identify certain requirements that must be
1503 met before specific provisions of the order are modified. A court may modify a term of a
1514 guardianship order as needed to grant relief to a party to address contempt or other failure
1525 to follow the order.

16 bring a petition to terminate the guardianship of a minor. A parent's notification to the
17 court of the revocation of prior consent for a guardianship must be considered a petition to
18 terminate the guardianship. Before the court may apply the termination requirements in

20 burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the parent seeking to terminate
21 the guardianship is currently unfit to regain custody of the minor, in accordance with the
22 standard set forth in section 5‑204, subsection 2, paragraph C. If the party opposing
23 termination of the guardianship fails to meet its burden of proof on the question of the
24 parent's fitness to regain custody, the court shall terminate the guardianship and make any
25 further order that may be appropriate. In a contested action, the court may appoint counsel
26 for the minor or for any indigent guardian or parent. If the court appoints counsel for a
27 minor or an indigent guardian or parent under this subsection, the court shall provide
28 reasonable compensation to and reimburse the reasonable expenses of the attorney. In
29 ruling on a petition to terminate a guardianship, the court may modify the terms of the

13 SUMMARY
1144 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, replaces the bill. The
1155 amendment makes the following changes to the laws governing court-appointed counsel.
16 1. It amends the definition of "indigent legal services" to include services that an
17 attorney performs at the direction of the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services
18 that aid the commission in its duty to provide indigent legal services.
19 2. It provides that the commission is not responsible for compensating counsel
20 appointed by a District Court or a county probate court to represent a party in a proceeding
21 under the Maine Uniform Probate Code. It further clarifies that if a court appoints an
22 attorney to represent a party who has a right to counsel at public expense under the Maine
23 Uniform Probate Code, the court is responsible for paying reasonable compensation to and
24 reimbursing the reasonable expenses of the attorney. The court is also responsible for
25 paying reasonable compensation to and reimbursing the reasonable expenses of an attorney
26 appointed at the court’s discretion to represent a minor or an indigent party in a proceeding
27 under the Maine Uniform Probate Code.
28 3. It provides that the commission is not responsible for compensating a guardian ad
29 litem appointed by a District Court or a county probate court in a termination of parental
30 rights proceeding or in any proceeding under the Maine Uniform Probate Code.
31 4. It provides that if a termination of parental rights proceeding is brought under the
32 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 19-A, the court is responsible for compensating any counsel
33 the court may, in its discretion, appoint to represent the petitioner in the termination
34 proceeding. By contrast, the commission is responsible for compensating counsel
35 appointed to represent the parent whose rights may be terminated.
36 5. It clarifies that the commission, not the court, is responsible for compensating an
37 attorney appointed to represent a person subject to an involuntary commitment proceeding.
38 6. It prohibits a court from directly assigning public defenders or employed counsel,
39 who are employees of the commission, to represent parties in particular proceedings.
