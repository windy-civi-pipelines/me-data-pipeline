JOINT RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING THE MAINE FOREST
SERVICE FOR ITS 2024 OUT-OF-STATE MOBILIZATIONS
WHEREAS, regionally and nationally, the Maine Forest Service, as part of the
Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, works within mutual aid agreements to
assist state and federal partners, including during the recent 2024 mobilization season; and
WHEREAS, through the Northeast Forest Fire Protection Compact and National Stafford
Act Master Agreement, the Maine Forest Service had 30 mobilizations in 2024, sending
resources to other parts of the country to respond to 25 incidents, including Hurricane Helene
in the Town of Black Mountain in North Carolina; and
WHEREAS, in 2024 the Maine Forest Service also sent personnel and equipment to
California, New Mexico, Washington, Nevada, Oregon, Georgia, Alabama, Connecticut and
Massachusetts; and
WHEREAS, forty-one rangers, one forester and one entomologist from the Maine Forest
Service participated in the 2024 mobilization season, as did staff from the Maine Land Use
Planning Commission and other state agencies and 24 call-when-needed firefighters; and
WHEREAS, the Maine Forest Service sent these personnel and resources to other states
to respond to wildfires and natural disasters, but because of our mutual aid agreements, Maine
can rely on help from other states when natural disasters occur here; and
WHEREAS, while Maine forest rangers and Maine Forest Service staff, other state staff
and the call-when-needed firefighters are highly trained, by mobilizing across the country, they
gained invaluable additional training and experience that they can apply to the protection of
Maine's natural resources; and
WHEREAS, wildfire suppression and emergency response missions are inherently
dangerous, but through training, having reliable equipment, using proper personal protective
equipment, conducting medical screenings and relying on peer support systems, the Maine
Forest Service was successful operationally and in protecting all personnel both here and away
in 2024; now, therefore, be it
RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred Thirty-second Legislature now
assembled in the First Regular Session, take this opportunity to recognize the Maine Forest
Service for its 2024 mobilization season and express our appreciation for and pride in the
personnel of the Maine Forest Service and all who answered the call.
