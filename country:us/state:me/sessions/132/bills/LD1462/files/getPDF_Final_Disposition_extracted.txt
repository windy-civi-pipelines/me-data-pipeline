except that a municipality may adopt restrictions regulating the time, place and manner of
the vending of expressive matter if the restrictions are:
A. Directly related to health, safety or welfare concerns;
B. Necessary to ensure the public's use and enjoyment of natural resources and
recreational opportunities;
C. Necessary to prevent an undue concentration of commercial activity that
unreasonably interferes with the scenic and natural character of a park owned or
operated by the municipality;
D. Limitations on hours of operation that are not unduly restrictive;
E. Necessary to maintain sanitary conditions; or
F. Necessary to ensure compliance with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of
