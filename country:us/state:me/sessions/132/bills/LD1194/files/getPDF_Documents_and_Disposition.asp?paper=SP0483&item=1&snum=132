5 pursuant to this chapter.
6 1. Annual mileage. The department shall maintain a record of the annual mileage of

10 during a motor vehicle inspection as required under Title 29-A, chapter 15.
11 The department shall create a digital reporting system for an owner of a motor vehicle to
12 report annual mileage for the purposes of calculating the usage-based infrastructure fee
13 pursuant to subsection 2.
14 2. Calculation of usage-based infrastructure fee. A motor vehicle is subject to a

32 biennial audit report on the financial and operational impact of the usage-based
33 infrastructure fee to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over
34 transportation matters. The report must include an evaluation of municipal funding to
35 ensure municipalities receive at least an equivalent revenue through usage-based
36 infrastructure fees as that received from excise taxes.
37 7. Progress report. By January 1, 2028 and each year thereafter, the department shall
38 submit a report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over
39 transportation matters. The committee is authorized to submit legislation related to the

5 Sec. A-2. 36 MRSA §1482, sub-§1, ¶C, as amended by PL 2013, c. 263, §1, is
6 further amended to read:
7 C. For the privilege of operating a motor vehicle or camper trailer on the public ways,
8 each motor vehicle, other than a stock race car, or each camper trailer to be so operated
9 is subject to excise tax as follows, except as specified in subparagraph (3), (4) or (5):
10 a sum equal to 24 mills on each dollar of the maker's list price for the first or current
11 year of model, 17 1/2 mills for the 2nd year, 13 1/2 mills for the 3rd year, 10 mills for
12 the 4th year, 6 1/2 mills for the 5th year and 4 mills for the 6th and succeeding years.
13 The minimum tax is $5 for a motor vehicle other than a bicycle with motor attached,
14 $2.50 for a bicycle with motor attached, $15 for a camper trailer other than a tent trailer
15 and $5 for a tent trailer. The excise tax on a stock race car is $5. Beginning July 1,
16 2025 and each July 1st for the next 4 years, each amount specified in this paragraph is
17 reduced by 20% of the original amount for each year until the amount equals zero after
18 the final reduction on July 1, 2029.
19 (1) On new registrations of automobiles New automobiles, trucks and truck
20 tractors, the excise tax payment must be made prior to registration and is for a one-
21 year period from the date of registration purchased from a motor vehicle dealer
22 licensed in any state for the sale of new motor vehicles are exempt from the excise
23 tax under this section beginning July 1, 2025.
24 (2) Vehicles registered under the International Registration Plan are subject to an
25 excise tax determined on a monthly proration basis if their registration period is
26 less than 12 months.
27 (3) For commercial vehicles manufactured in model year 1996 and after, the
28 amount of excise tax due for trucks or truck tractors registered for more than 26,000
29 pounds and for Class A special mobile equipment, as defined in Title 29‑A, section
30 101, subsection 70, is based on the purchase price in the original year of title rather
31 than on the list price. Verification of purchase price for the application of excise
32 tax is determined by the initial bill of sale or the state sales tax document provided
33 at point of purchase. The initial bill of sale is that issued by the dealer to the initial
34 purchaser of a new vehicle.
35 (4) For buses manufactured in model year 2006 and after, the amount of excise
36 tax due is based on the purchase price in the original year of title rather than on the
37 list price. Verification of purchase price for the application of excise tax is
38 determined by the initial bill of sale or the state sales tax document provided at
39 point of purchase. The initial bill of sale is that issued by the dealer to the initial
40 purchaser of a new vehicle.
41 (5) For trucks or truck tractors registered for more than 26,000 pounds that have
42 been reconstructed using a prepackaged kit that may include a frame, front axle or
43 body but does not include a power train or engine and for which a new certificate
Page 3 - 132LR0594(01)

414 of title is required to be issued, the amount of excise tax due is based on the maker's
425 list price of the prepackaged kit.
3 For motor vehicles being registered pursuant to Title 29‑A, section 405, subsection 1,
4 paragraph C, the excise tax must be prorated for the number of months in the
5 registration.
6 Sec. A-3. Reports. By January 1, 2026, the Department of Transportation shall
7 submit a plan to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over
8 transportation matters that outlines how the usage-based infrastructure fee under the Maine
9 Revised Statutes, Title 23, chapter 19, subchapter 9 will be implemented statewide
10 beginning on July 1, 2027. The committee is authorized to submit legislation related to the
11 plan.
12 By January 1, 2035, the department shall submit a report to the joint standing
13 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over transportation matters. The report
14 must include findings and recommendations regarding the compliance, effectiveness and
15 equity of the usage-based infrastructure fee pursuant to Title 23, section 1863. The
16 department may also consider whether the creation of a 0.5% luxury goods sales tax is
17 needed to supplement the cost of administering the usage-based infrastructure fee. The
18 committee is authorized to submit legislation related to the report.
19 PART B

30 application and upon evidence of payment of the excise tax required by Title 36, section
31 1482 or upon evidence of exemption from excise tax under Title 36, section 1483,
32 subsection 12, shall issue, with no annual registration fee, a registration certificate and upon
33 request special designating plates to be used in lieu of regular registration plates for a

35 disabled veteran when that application is accompanied by certification from the United
36 States Department of Veterans Affairs or any branch of the United States Armed Forces as
37 to the veteran's permanent disability and receipt of 100% service-connected benefits. Upon
38 request a disability placard may be issued at no fee. The Secretary of State may issue a
39 registration certificate and special designating plates for more than one vehicle owned by

12 price of a vehicle is not readily obtainable the State Tax Assessor shall prescribe the maker's
13 list price to be used or the manner in which the maker's list price is determined.

Page 7 - 132LR0594(01)

1 3. It establishes, beginning July 1, 2027, a usage-based infrastructure fee. The usage-
2 based infrastructure fee imposes a fee on a person who owns a motor vehicle for using

4 maintained by the Department of Transportation.
5 4. It specifies that a person or a certified inspection mechanic during an annual motor
6 vehicle inspection must report the annual mileage for the purposes of calculating the usage-
7 based infrastructure fee. The department is responsible for establishing a digital reporting
8 system for an owner of a motor vehicle to report the annual mileage on the motor vehicle
9 and ensuring accurate vehicle mileage reporting.
10 5. It establishes the Maine Transportation Fund within the department for the purposes
11 of maintaining and repairing roads, maintaining and repairing bridges and funding
12 transportation infrastructure projects. The funds allocated to the fund may be transferred to
13 municipalities and to the Highway Fund.
14 6. It requires the State Auditor to submit a biennial audit report to the joint standing
15 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over transportation matters on the
16 financial and operational impact of the usage-based infrastructure fee, including a
17 comparison of municipal funding generated by the fees rather than excise taxes.
18 7. It requires the department to submit an annual report on the findings and
19 recommendations regarding the compliance of the usage-based infrastructure fee, findings
20 and recommendations regarding the effectiveness and equity of the usage-based
21 infrastructure fee and the costs associated with the transition to and the administration of
22 the usage-based infrastructure fee.
23 8. It requires, by January 1, 2026, the department to submit a plan to the joint standing
24 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over transportation matters on the
25 implementation of the usage-based infrastructure fee.
26 9. It requires, by January 1, 2035, the department to submit a report to the joint standing
27 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over transportation matters on the findings
28 and recommendations regarding the compliance, effectiveness and equity of the usage-
29 based infrastructure fees.
