1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, placement in assisted living facilities is limited, resulting in waiting lists;
4 and
5 Whereas, existing facilities that are constructing new facilities should be licensed as
6 quickly as possible; and
7 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
8 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
9 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
10 therefore,
11 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
12 Sec. 1. 22 MRSA §7851, sub-§3-A, ¶B, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 176, §7, is
13 amended to read:
14 B. The department may issue more than one license at the same license level to an
15 applicant for an assisted living facility license or a residential care facility license that,
16 on October 1, 2023, held more than one license at the same license level for services
17 offered in the same location. The department may also issue more than one license at
18 the same license level to an applicant for an assisted living facility license or a
19 residential care facility license if the applicant had begun construction, prior to October
20 1, 2023, on a facility at the same license level for services offered in the same location
21 as long as there were no violations of the license substantiated prior to October 1, 2023.
22 Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation
23 takes effect when approved.
24 SUMMARY
2255 This bill allows an assisted living facility that received a license prior to October 1,
2266 2023 and commenced construction of a new facility prior to October 1, 2023 to be subject
2277 to the same licensure requirements as the licensee was subject to at the time of the prior
2288 license. If there were licensing violations at the facility under the previous license, the
2299 licensee does not qualify.
