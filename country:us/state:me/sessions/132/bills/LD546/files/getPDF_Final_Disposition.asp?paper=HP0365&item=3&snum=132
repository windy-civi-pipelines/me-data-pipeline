H.P. 365 - L.D. 546
Resolve, to Require the Preparation of Preapproved Building Types
Sec. 1. Preapproved building types. Resolved: That the Maine Office of
Community Affairs, referred to in this resolve as "the office," shall contract with an
appropriate consultant to establish a set of building types that municipalities may adopt as
preapproved building types in order to reduce the cost and time associated with processing
building permit applications.
The office shall:
1. Require the consultant to develop no fewer than 5 and no more than 8 preapproved
building types. Preapproved building types may include, but are not limited to, single-
family homes, duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes and mixed-use residential and retail
buildings. Each preapproved building type must include no fewer than 8 and no more than
10 design options for building components. For purposes of this section, "building
components" include dormers, rear and side additions, windows, porches, stoops, cross
gables and other elements that add volume to a building. For each preapproved building
type, multiple design options must be prepared to reflect the vernacular architecture in the
State, with a range of building components that allow for permitted modifications for each
preapproved building type. For purposes of this section, "vernacular architecture" means
an architectural style that is designed based on local needs, availability of construction
materials and local traditions. Preapproved building types must be designed to fit on lots
with dimensions that commonly exist in the State and that allow for efficient use of private
and public infrastructure. Preapproved building types must be designed to meet any
applicable state or federal building and energy codes and have prototypical site plans for
each preapproved building type in order to identify the location of the building on the lot,
location of parking on the lot, access to parking on the lot, setbacks and build-to lines;
2. Determine the area median income for each county in the State and require the
consultant to develop preapproved building types that include units that can be rented at a
cost that does not exceed 30% of the area median income in the county where the building
may be used as a preapproved building type;
3. Ensure a process of public engagement with the consultant as the consultant
develops the preapproved building types, including, but not limited to, in-person focus

groups, online crowdsourced visual preference surveys and at least 2 rounds of public
crowdsourced feedback on draft preapproved building types and prototypical site plans;
4. Require the consultant to work with the Department of Public Safety, Office of the
State Fire Marshal to determine compliance of each preapproved building type with the
National Fire Protection Association Life Safety Code adopted by the office;
5. Require the consultant to create a final proposed work product that includes a
catalog of preapproved building types and prototypical site plans, including a publicly
accessible website with information and forms relating to preapproved building types; and
6. Seek input from a postsecondary institution in the State with a program that uses
new technologies in developing methods to produce materials and develop building
methods designed to make housing more efficient and affordable.
Sec. 2. Maine Office of Community Affairs to provide report. Resolved:
That the office shall submit a report no later than November 4, 2026 to the joint standing
committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over housing matters with findings and
recommendations relating to preapproved building types established under section 1. The
report must include recommended legislation to ensure that when a municipality adopts
preapproved building types, applications for permits to develop a preapproved building
type must be deemed administratively approved when the preapproved building types are
located along existing streets or within designated growth areas served by a public, special
district or other centrally managed water system and a public, special district or other
comparable sewer system. The joint standing committee of the Legislature having
jurisdiction over housing matters may report out legislation relating to the subject matter
of the report to the 133rd Legislature in 2027.
Sec. 3. Appropriations and allocations. Resolved: That the following
appropriations and allocations are made.
