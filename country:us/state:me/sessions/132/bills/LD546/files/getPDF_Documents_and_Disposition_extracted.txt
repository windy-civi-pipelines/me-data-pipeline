1 Sec. 1. Preapproved building types. Resolved: That the Department of
2 Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, Bureau of Resource Information and Land Use
3 Planning, referred to in this resolve as "the bureau," shall contract with an appropriate
4 consultant to establish a set of building types that municipalities may adopt as preapproved
5 building types in order to reduce the cost and time associated with processing building
6 permit applications.
7 The bureau shall:
8 1. Require the consultant to develop no fewer than 5 and no more than 8 preapproved
9 building types. Preapproved building types may include, but are not limited to, single-
10 family homes, duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes and mixed-use residential and retail
11 buildings. Each preapproved building type must include no fewer than 8 and no more than
12 10 design options for building components. For purposes of this section, "building
13 components" include dormers, rear and side additions, windows, porches, stoops, cross
14 gables and other elements that add volume to a building. For each preapproved building
15 type, multiple design options must be prepared to reflect the vernacular architecture in the
16 State, with a range of building components that allow for permitted modifications for each
17 preapproved building type. For purposes of this section, "vernacular architecture" means
18 an architectural style that is designed based on local needs, availability of construction
19 materials and local traditions. Preapproved building types must be designed to fit on lots
20 with dimensions that commonly exist in the State and that allow for efficient use of private
21 and public infrastructure. Preapproved building types must be designed to meet any
22 applicable state or federal building and energy codes and have prototypical site plans for
23 each preapproved building type in order to identify the location of the building on the lot,
24 location of parking on the lot, access to parking on the lot, setbacks and build-to lines;
25 2. Determine the area median income for each county in the State and require the
26 consultant to develop preapproved building types that include units that can be rented at a
27 cost that does not exceed 30% of the area median income in the county where the building
28 may be used as a preapproved building type;
29 3. Ensure a process of public engagement with the consultant as the consultant
30 develops the preapproved building types, including, but not limited to, online
31 crowdsourced visual preference surveys and at least 2 rounds of public crowdsourced
32 feedback on draft preapproved building types and prototypical site plans;
33 4. Require the consultant to work with the Department of Public Safety, Office of the
34 State Fire Marshal to determine compliance of each preapproved building type with the
35 National Fire Protection Association Life Safety Code adopted by the office;
36 5. Require the consultant to create a final proposed work product that includes a
37 catalog of preapproved building types and prototypical site plans, including a publicly
38 accessible website with information and forms relating to preapproved building types; and
39 6. Seek input from a postsecondary institution in the State with a program that uses
40 new technologies in developing methods to produce materials and develop building
41 methods designed to make housing more efficient and affordable.
42 Sec. 2. Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, Bureau of
43 Resource Information and Land Use Planning to provide report. Resolved:
44 That the bureau shall submit a report no later than November 4, 2026 to the joint standing
Page 1 - 132LR1959(01)
415 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over housing matters with findings and
426 recommendations relating to preapproved building types established under section 1. The
437 report must include recommended legislation to ensure that when a municipality adopts
448 preapproved building types, applications for permits to develop a preapproved building
459 type must be deemed administratively approved when the preapproved building types are
560 located along existing streets or within designated growth areas served by a public, special
571 district or other centrally managed water system and a public, special district or other
582 comparable sewer system. The joint standing committee of the Legislature having
593 jurisdiction over housing matters may report out legislation relating to the subject matter
1504 of the report to the First Regular Session of the 133rd Legislature.

12 SUMMARY
1133 This resolve directs the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, Bureau
1144 of Resource Information and Land Use Planning to contract with an appropriate consultant
1155 to establish a set of building types that municipalities may adopt as preapproved building
1166 types in order to reduce the cost and time associated with processing building permit
1177 applications. It requires the consultant to ensure that each preapproved building type can
1188 be developed to ensure that rent for affordable units does not exceed 30% of the median
1199 income in the county where the building will be located, and it requires the consultant to
2200 seek input from a postsecondary institution in the State with a program that uses new
2211 technologies to produce materials and develop building methods designed to make housing
2222 more efficient and affordable. The resolve also requires the bureau to submit a report no
2233 later than November 4, 2026 to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having
2244 jurisdiction over housing matters. The joint standing committee may report out legislation
