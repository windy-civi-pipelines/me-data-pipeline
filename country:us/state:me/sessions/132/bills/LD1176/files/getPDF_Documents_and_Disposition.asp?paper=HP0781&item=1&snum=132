3 amended to read:
4 1. Definitions. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the
5 following terms have the following meanings.
6 A. "Emerging fishery" means the commercial fishing for any marine organism, except
7 herring and groundfish species, that requires a commercial fishing license issued under
8 section 6501 or a commercial pelagic and anadromous fishing license issued under
9 section 6502-A.
10 B. "Endorsement" means an authorization, identified on a commercial fishing license
11 issued under section 6501 or a commercial pelagic and anadromous fishing license
12 issued under section 6502-A, to harvest, possess, transport and sell a specific marine
13 organism for which there is an emerging fishery.
14 Sec. 2. 12 MRSA §6171-B, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 1999, c. 297, §1, is amended
15 to read:
16 2. Determination of sustainability. The commissioner may investigate conditions
17 affecting marine resources and, with the advice and consent of the Marine Resources
18 Advisory Council, may require a person to hold an endorsement to participate in an
19 emerging fishery if the commissioner determines that a marine organism or its habitat is
20 under increasing pressure that could impact its sustainability or if the commissioner
21 determines that a marine organism is becoming established in the waters of this State and
22 that access to that marine organism must be limited to ensure its sustainable management.
23 The commissioner shall ensure that emerging fisheries do not develop at a rate that is not
24 sustainable on a long-term basis.
25 Harvesters involved in an emerging fishery may petition the commissioner to investigate
26 the sustainability of that emerging fishery.
27 Sec. 3. 12 MRSA §6171-B, sub-§4, as enacted by PL 1999, c. 297, §1, is amended
28 to read:
29 4. Endorsement required. Notwithstanding section sections 6501 and 6502-A, a
30 person may not fish for, take, possess, ship, transport or sell a marine organism for which
31 an endorsement is required pursuant to subsection 2 unless that person holds a current
32 commercial fishing license or a commercial pelagic and anadromous fishing license with
33 an endorsement for that organism, except that a license with an endorsement is not required
34 for that person to fish for, take, possess or transport the organism only for personal use.
35 A fee may not be charged for an endorsement required pursuant to this section.
36 Sec. 4. 12 MRSA §6804, as amended by PL 2017, c. 346, §§1 and 2, is further

27 The commissioner shall provide a report regarding management of the northern shrimp
28 resource and the northern shrimp fishing industry to the joint standing committee of the
29 Legislature having jurisdiction over marine resources matters by January 15th of the year
30 following a year in which the commissioner limited the number of licenses issued under

33 SUMMARY
3344 This bill amends the sustainable development of emerging fisheries law to allow the
3355 Commissioner of Marine Resources to require an endorsement on a fishing license for an
3366 emerging fishery for a species whose harvest is currently authorized under the commercial
3377 pelagic and anadromous fishing license. It also removes a license exemption for the taking
3388 of northern shrimp for personal use and creates a resident noncommercial northern shrimp
3399 license at a cost of $20, which is deposited in the Shrimp Management Fund.
