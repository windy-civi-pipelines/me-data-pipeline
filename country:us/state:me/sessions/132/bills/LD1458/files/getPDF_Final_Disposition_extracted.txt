13 Amend the bill by striking out all of sections 2 and 3 and inserting the following:
14 'Sec. 2. 38 MRSA §484-D, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 448, §2, is amended

20 and fisheries habitats, as defined by the department, to comply with section 484, subsection
21 3 conservation projects to compensate for the conversion of undeveloped areas of land for
22 renewable energy development. Compensation fees pursuant to this section must be
23 designed to satisfy all requirements related to off-site habitat improvements or habitat
24 preservation for a renewable energy development, except for any compensation
25 requirements relating to habitat for rare, threatened or endangered species; high and
26 moderate value deer wintering areas; significant vernal pool habitat; high and moderate
27 value waterfowl and wading bird habitat; or any other habitat defined as significant wildlife
28 habitat under section 480-B, subsection 10. For purposes of this section, "renewable energy
29 development" means a development subject to the requirements of this article that is:
30 A. A solar energy development and associated facilities;

7 consist of habitat comparable to the habitat affected by the renewable energy development.
8 The department shall base approval of a compensation conservation project on the
9 management priorities for the biophysical region in which the project is located. For

19 It also amends current law regarding the compensation fee program to offset the
20 adverse effects of a renewable energy development to provide that the program must fund
21 conservation projects to compensate for the conversion of undeveloped areas of land for
22 renewable energy development and that compensation fees under that program must be
23 designed to satisfy all requirements related to off-site habitat improvements or habitat
24 preservation for a renewable energy development, except for any compensation
25 requirements relating to habitat for rare, threatened or endangered species; high and
