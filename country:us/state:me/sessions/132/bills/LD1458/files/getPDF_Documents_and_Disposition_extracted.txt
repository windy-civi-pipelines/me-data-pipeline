12 compensation and instead requires a compensation fee equal to the average value of the
13 undeveloped land occupied by the renewable energy development project, with certain
14 exceptions. The bill also specifies which wildlife habitats the department may consider for
15 purposes of determining an adverse effect. Finally, the bill changes rules adopted by the
16 department to routine technical rules.
