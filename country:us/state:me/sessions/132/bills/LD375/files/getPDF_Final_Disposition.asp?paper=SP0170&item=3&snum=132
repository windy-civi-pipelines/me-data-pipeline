Resolve, Directing the University of Maine System to Study the Feasibility of
Distance Learning Programs at the University of Maine School of Law
Sec. 1. University of Maine System to study feasibility of distance learning
courses at University of Maine School of Law. Resolved: That the University of
Maine System shall study the feasibility of expanding the current juris doctor degree
program at the University of Maine School of Law to offer distance learning courses and
examine providing a new juris doctor degree program that provides 100% distance
learning. The feasibility study must include the following:
1. The costs of operating the current juris doctor degree program with distance learning
courses and the anticipated effect the offering of distance learning courses will have on
student enrollment in the program;
2. The costs of operating a new juris doctor degree program that provides 100%
distance learning courses and the anticipated enrollment of students in such a program;
3. The process and costs of the University of Maine School of Law to apply to the
American Bar Association for acquiescence, as necessary, to offer a juris doctor degree
program with distance learning, whether by expanding the current juris doctor degree
program to offer distance learning courses or by providing a new juris doctor degree
program that provides 100% distance learning; and
4. The anticipated benefits and disadvantages of expanding and operating the current
juris doctor degree program to offer distance learning courses and of providing a new juris
doctor degree program providing 100% distance learning courses.
The University of Maine System shall submit a report detailing its findings, including any
suggested legislation, no later than November 4, 2026, to the joint standing committee of
the Legislature having jurisdiction over education matters. The joint standing committee
may report out a bill related to the contents of the report to the 133rd Legislature in 2027.
