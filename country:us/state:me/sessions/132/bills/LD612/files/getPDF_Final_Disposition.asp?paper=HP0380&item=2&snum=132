COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 380, L.D. 612
1 SUMMARY
22 This amendment removes from the bill the requirement that the Department of Health
33 and Human Services cross-check data of lottery winners with recipients of Medicaid
44 benefits or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and deduct from the winnings
55 the past 5 years of benefits received by the prize winner and administrative costs. It limits
66 the department’s duty to monitor solely out-of-state electronic benefits transfer, or EBT,
77 card transactions to swiped transactions, defined as transactions that require the user to
88 insert or present an EBT card into or to a physical card reading device to complete the
99 transaction. It excludes purchases made in New Hampshire from the monitoring
1100 requirement. It changes from 90 to 45 days the time after which solely out-of-state
1111 transactions trigger a department response. The amendment also changes the title of the
1122 bill.
