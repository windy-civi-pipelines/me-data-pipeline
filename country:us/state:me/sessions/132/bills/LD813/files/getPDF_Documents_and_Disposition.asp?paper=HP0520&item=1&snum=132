35 commission in favor of state recognition within 2 years after receipt of the
36 recommendation by the legislative committee. For purposes of this paragraph, the
37 Legislature fails to act if the Legislature fails to enact legislation recognizing the
38 applicant or denying recognition to the applicant.
39 5. Effect of state recognition. Recognized tribes and their members are subject to all
40 laws of the State. Recognition confers only those rights specifically described in this
41 chapter and may not be construed to grant the recognized tribe or its members any right or
42 claim to land or real estate in the State or right to conduct any gambling activities except
43 as otherwise allowed by the laws of the State.

4 Sec. 4. Staggered terms. Notwithstanding the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5,
5 section 26002, subsection 4, for the original appointments of members of the Maine
6 Commission on Native American Indian Affairs, the Governor shall designate the terms of
7 2 of the members as one-year terms. An initial term of one year under this section may not
8 be considered a full term for purposes of limiting the number of terms for which a member
9 of the commission may serve.
10 Sec. 5. Meetings. Notwithstanding the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, section
11 26002, subsection 6, the Maine Commission on Native American Indian Affairs shall meet
12 at least 3 times during the first 12 months following the effective date of this Act.
13 SUMMARY
1144 This bill establishes a process for state recognition of Native American Indian tribes,
1155 which is designed to recognize the historical and cultural contributions of Native
1166 Americans to the State, to protect and strengthen the heritage of Native Americans in the
1177 State and to provide technical assistance to state-recognized Native American Indian tribes
1188 and their members related to state and federal programs and activities. It establishes the
1199 Maine Commission on Native American Indian Affairs, a 5-member panel of experts
2200 appointed by the Governor to review and to make recommendations on applications for
2211 state recognition of Native American Indian tribes in the State and to provide specific
2222 assistance to state-recognized Native American Indian tribes and their members. The
2233 ultimate decision whether to confer state recognition lies with the Legislature.
24 State-recognized Native American Indian tribes and their members remain subject to
25 all of the laws of the State, and recognition may not be construed to grant the state-
26 recognized Native American Indian tribe or its members any right or claim to land or real
27 estate in the State or the right to conduct any gambling activities otherwise prohibited by
28 law.

32 D. At least one public hearing on each application;
33 E. Appointment, in coordination with the applicant, of a 3-member review panel to
34 determine the sufficiency, accuracy and relevance of the application materials and any
35 supplemental documentation and to submit a detailed written report of its findings and
36 conclusions to the commission, the applicant and the legislative committee. The
37 members appointed must be professional or academic specialists with expertise in
38 cultural or physical anthropology, Indian law, archaeology, Native American Indian
39 genealogy or history or a related subject area. Members of the review panel may not

Page 4 - 132LR1309(01)

1 F. Review by the commission of the application and any supplemental documentation,
2 the report of the review panel and any other relevant information to determine
3 compliance with subsection 1 and to recommend whether the Legislature should grant
4 or deny state recognition of the applicant. A recommendation in favor of state
5 recognition of the applicant may be made only by a majority vote of eligible
6 commission members. If the commission recommends that the Legislature deny state
7 recognition of the applicant, it must provide the applicant and the legislative committee
8 with a written notice of the reasons for the denial, including specific information
9 regarding the criteria in subsection 1 that were not satisfied;
10 G. Deadlines for the review panel to submit its written report to the commission and
11 for the commission to notify the applicant and the legislative committee of its
12 recommendation. The deadline for the commission to notify the applicant and the
13 legislative committee of its recommendation may not be later than one year after the
14 date that the application and any supplemental documentation were filed, unless the
15 commission provides a written explanation to the applicant and the legislative
16 committee of the reasons for the delay that identifies the expected date for the
17 commission's issuance of its recommendation;
18 H. A process for the applicant to file, within one year of receiving notice of the denial
19 by the commission, a request for reconsideration supported by additional
20 documentation. An applicant that fails to file a request for reconsideration within the
21 time required by this paragraph may not file a new application for 2 years following
22 the date the applicant received the notice of denial;
23 I. Procedures for the applicant to withdraw its application at any time before the
24 commission issues a recommendation under paragraph F, which must prohibit the
25 applicant from filing a new application for 2 years following the date that the
26 application is withdrawn; and
27 J. A requirement that a new application filed by an applicant more than 2 years after
28 receiving a notice of denial by the commission or more than 2 years following the
29 withdrawal of its earlier application must be considered without reference to the denied
30 or withdrawn application and any supplemental documentation that was submitted with
31 the denied or withdrawn application.
32 4. State recognition. An applicant may be recognized only:
33 A. By approval of the Legislature; or
34 B. By the failure of the Legislature to take action on a recommendation from the
35 commission in favor of state recognition within 2 years after receipt of the
36 recommendation by the legislative committee. For purposes of this paragraph, the
37 Legislature fails to act if the Legislature fails to enact legislation recognizing the
38 applicant or denying recognition to the applicant.
39 5. Effect of state recognition. Recognized tribes and their members are subject to all
40 laws of the State. Recognition confers only those rights specifically described in this
41 chapter and may not be construed to grant the recognized tribe or its members any right or
42 claim to land or real estate in the State or right to conduct any gambling activities except
43 as otherwise allowed by the laws of the State.

1 6. Confidentiality. Records of genealogy submitted as part of an application or in
2 support of an application for state recognition under this section are confidential and may
3 be disclosed by the commission only to members of the review panel.
4 Sec. 4. Staggered terms. Notwithstanding the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5,
5 section 26002, subsection 4, for the original appointments of members of the Maine
6 Commission on Native American Indian Affairs, the Governor shall designate the terms of
7 2 of the members as one-year terms. An initial term of one year under this section may not
8 be considered a full term for purposes of limiting the number of terms for which a member
9 of the commission may serve.
10 Sec. 5. Meetings. Notwithstanding the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, section
11 26002, subsection 6, the Maine Commission on Native American Indian Affairs shall meet
12 at least 3 times during the first 12 months following the effective date of this Act.
13 SUMMARY
1144 This bill establishes a process for state recognition of Native American Indian tribes,
1155 which is designed to recognize the historical and cultural contributions of Native
1166 Americans to the State, to protect and strengthen the heritage of Native Americans in the
1177 State and to provide technical assistance to state-recognized Native American Indian tribes
1188 and their members related to state and federal programs and activities. It establishes the
1199 Maine Commission on Native American Indian Affairs, a 5-member panel of experts
2200 appointed by the Governor to review and to make recommendations on applications for
2211 state recognition of Native American Indian tribes in the State and to provide specific
2222 assistance to state-recognized Native American Indian tribes and their members. The
2233 ultimate decision whether to confer state recognition lies with the Legislature.
24 State-recognized Native American Indian tribes and their members remain subject to
25 all of the laws of the State, and recognition may not be construed to grant the state-
26 recognized Native American Indian tribe or its members any right or claim to land or real
27 estate in the State or the right to conduct any gambling activities otherwise prohibited by
28 law.
