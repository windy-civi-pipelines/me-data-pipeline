1166 "commercial sporting camp." Under the provisions of the bill, the Department of Health
1177 and Human Services may not require a commercial sporting camp located in an area
1188 without a municipal water supply to install sprinkler systems or to make upgrades or

2200 and septic systems are operational. The department may not require an applicant for a
2211 license to demonstrate compliance with any other state laws except for compliance with
2222 the licensing requirements. The bill provides that a commercial sporting camp must qualify
2233 to serve meals and may not be prohibited from serving or catering meals to the general
2244 public if the camp meets the requirements of a Class A restaurant. The bill also makes a
2255 commercial sporting camp eligible for a separate moose permit drawing.
