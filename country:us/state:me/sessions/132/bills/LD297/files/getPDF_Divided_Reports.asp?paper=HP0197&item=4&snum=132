1199 This amendment amends Committee Amendment "A." The amendment clarifies that
2200 the 12-month period described in Public Law 2023, chapter 283, section 2, subsection 1
2211 means a 12-month period ending prior to July 1, 2026.
22 The amendment adds a new subsection to the public law that provides that the total
23 weight of the residue generated by a solid waste processing facility and disposed of in a
24 solid waste landfill that may be considered waste generated within the State for the period
25 between July 1, 2026 and June 30, 2027 is 12,500 tons as long as it is composed of
26 oversized bulky waste placed in a state-owned solid waste landfill.
27 The amendment also adds provisions allowing additional excess residue associated
28 with the processing of the oversized bulky waste in any 12-month period prior to July 1,
29 2026 to be considered waste generated within the State, not to exceed 75,000 tons in that
30 12-month period, as long as that additional excess residue is not composed of oversized
31 bulky waste and is used at a state-owned solid waste landfill as daily cover. The amendment
32 provides that the same conditions apply to additional excess residue associated with the
33 processing of the oversized bulky waste in the 12-month period between July 1, 2026 and
34 June 30, 2027, except that the maximum amount of residue that may be considered waste
35 generated within the State is 37,500 tons.
