1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, implementation of the provisions in this legislation facilitates the landfilling
4 of additional sludge amounts at the state-owned landfill by providing additional sludge
5 bulking and stabilization material; and
6 Whereas, Public Law 2023, chapter 283, section 2 provided a temporary allowance
7 for the disposal or placement of certain oversized bulky waste until July 1, 2025; and
8 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
9 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
10 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
11 therefore,
12 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
13 Sec. 1. PL 2023, c. 283, ยง2 is amended to read:
14 Sec. 2. Temporary allowance for disposal or placement of oversized bulky
15 waste in landfill. Notwithstanding any provision of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title
16 38, section 1303-C, subsection 40-A to the contrary, for the period beginning on the
17 effective date of this Act June 23, 2023 and ending July 1, 2025 2028:
18 1. If in any 12-month period the total weight of the residue generated by a solid waste
19 processing facility and disposed of or otherwise placed in a solid waste landfill exceeds the
20 total weight of the solid waste initially generated within the State that was processed by the
21 facility in that 12-month period, such excess residue, not to exceed 25,000 tons in that 12-
22 month period, is deemed to be waste generated within the State within the meaning of Title
23 38, section 1303-C, subsection 40-A as long as that excess residue is composed of oversized
24 bulky waste and is disposed of or otherwise placed in a state-owned solid waste landfill;
25 and.
26 2. Any excess residue, other than the excess residue identified in subsection 1,
27 generated by the facility in that 12-month period is deemed not to be waste generated within
28 the State within the meaning of Title 38, section 1303-C, subsection 40-A.
29 As used in this section, "oversized bulky waste" means large items of solid waste that
30 are residue from processing construction and demolition debris, including, but not limited
31 to, household appliances, furniture and mattresses.
32 For the purposes of this section, excess residue associated with the processing of
33 oversized bulky waste that is used as alternative daily cover is considered waste generated
34 within the State as defined in Title 38, section 1303-C, subsection 40-A.
35 Sec. 2. Retroactivity. This Act applies retroactively to June 23, 2023.
