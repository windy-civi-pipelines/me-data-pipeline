27 At least 50% of the waste that a solid waste processing facility characterizes as
28 recycled under this subparagraph must have been reused or recycled by the facility
29 through methods other than placement of the waste in a solid waste landfill, except
30 that a solid waste processing facility that was in operation during calendar year
31 2018, that accepts exclusively construction and demolition debris and that accepted
32 more than 200,000 tons of such debris in calendar year 2018 shall:
33 (a) Reuse or recycle at least 15% of such debris through methods other than

18 month period, is deemed to be waste generated within the State within the meaning of Title
19 38, section 1303-C, subsection 40-A, as long as that excess residue is composed of
20 oversized bulky waste and is disposed of or otherwise placed in a state-owned solid waste
21 landfill; and
22 1-A. Any additional excess residue associated with the processing of the oversized
23 bulky waste amount identified in subsection 1 generated by the solid waste processing
24 facility in that 12-month period and used at a solid waste landfill, not to exceed 75,000 tons
25 in that 12-month period, is deemed to be waste generated within the State within the
26 meaning of Title 38, section 1303-C, subsection 40-A, as long as that additional excess
27 residue is not composed of oversized bulky waste and is used at a state-owned solid waste
28 landfill as daily cover; and

30 subsections 1 and 1-A, generated by the solid waste processing facility in that 12-month

7 SUMMARY
88 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, replaces the bill,
99 changes the title and adds an appropriations and allocations section and does the following.
10 1. It amends the law regarding the reuse or recycling of construction and demolition
11 debris by certain solid waste processing facilities that were in operation during calendar
12 year 2018 and that accept exclusively construction and demolition debris by extending the
13 dates by which such facilities must reuse or recycle a certain percentage of such debris
14 through methods other than placement in a solid waste landfill.
15 2. Public Law 2023, chapter 283, section 2, which took effect June 23, 2023, provides
16 that for the period ending July 1, 2025, if in any 12-month period the total weight of the
17 residue generated by a solid waste processing facility and disposed of or otherwise placed
18 in a solid waste landfill exceeds the total weight of the solid waste initially generated within
19 the State that was processed by the facility in that 12-month period, such excess residue,
20 not to exceed 25,000 tons in that 12-month period, is deemed to be waste generated within
21 the State, as long as that excess residue is composed of oversized bulky waste and is
22 disposed of or otherwise placed in a state-owned solid waste landfill. Under that public
23 law, any other excess residue generated by the facility in that 12-month period is deemed
24 not to be waste generated within the State. The amendment amends that section of the
25 public law to extend the end date of the period in which the law applies to July 1, 2027. It
26 also provides that any additional excess residue associated with the processing of the
27 25,000 tons of oversized bulky waste amount generated by the solid waste processing
28 facility in that 12-month period and used at a solid waste landfill, not to exceed 75,000 tons
29 in that 12-month period, is deemed to be waste generated within the State, as long as that
30 additional excess residue is not composed of oversized bulky waste and is used at a state-
31 owned solid waste landfill as daily cover.
32 The changes to these laws provided in the amendment are made retroactive to June 23,
33 2023.
