41 A debt limit proposal becomes effective upon its acceptance by a majority of the legal
42 voters within the district voting at the referendum. Failure of approval by the majority of
43 voters voting at the referendum does not prevent subsequent referenda from being held for
44 the same purpose. The costs of referenda are borne by the district.
