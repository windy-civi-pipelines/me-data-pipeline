amended to read:
§6209. Ownership; title; management Fee title; evaluation; legislative approval;

1. Uses of funds. The board may use the Land for Maine's Future Trust Fund, the
Conservation and Recreation Fund and the Public Access to Maine Waters Fund to acquire
real property in both fee and less-than-fee simple interest, including, but not limited to,
conservation easements, access easements, scenic easements, other permanent interests in
land and long-term leases of at least 99 years as long as those acquisitions are primarily
natural lands meeting the criteria set forth in this chapter.
2. Title Fee title. Title Fee title to all lands interests in land acquired pursuant to this

lands may be contracted by the land-owning state agency to cooperating entities, subject to
appropriate lease arrangements, upon the recommendation of the agency's commissioner
Page 3 - 132LR0152(03)

and approval of the board clear to ensure that the State's interests in funding the acquisition
are protected.
3. Matching funds. When matching funds for a project include cash not derived from
a bond request, an allocation of up to 20% of the appraised value of the acquired land or
the amount of cash, whichever is less, may be put into the stewardship account of the state
agency holding title to the land.
4. Payments. Payments from the fund may be made to cooperating entities for
qualifying lands acquired on behalf of the State, provided that a state agency has issued to
the cooperating entity a letter of intent requesting assistance in the acquisition. Upon
submission to the state agency of a cooperating entity's direct expenses for acquisition and
related costs of an authorized acquisition, the board shall authorize payment of those
expenses, provided that the total of all expenses does not exceed the appraised value of the
acquired property. Expenses must be paid at intervals during the acquisition process, as
determined by the board.
5. Land evaluated. All lands interests in property acquired with money from the Land
for Maine's Future Trust Fund, the Conservation and Recreation Fund or the Public Access
to Maine Waters Fund must be evaluated for rare, threatened or endangered species of
plants and animals, exemplary natural communities, features of historic significance and
other high priority natural features and ecologic functions as determined by the board, with
reference to the best inventory data available to the State. Subsequent management by state
agencies holding properties found to have such important features and functions must
reflect the objective of maintaining and protecting those features and functions.
6. Legislative Fee title legislative approval. Except as provided in subsection 7, fee
interests in land acquired under this chapter and held by the State may not be sold or used
for purposes other than those stated in this chapter, unless approved by a 2/3 majority of

and the Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, may sell or otherwise
convey in accordance with Title 12, section 1814‑A access rights by easement across a rail
trail acquired under this chapter.
For the purposes of this subsection, "rail trail" means a former railroad right-of-way in
which the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry holds an ownership
interest and that is:
A. No longer used for rail service; and
B. Managed by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry for use as a

value" means any agreement in recordable form between the fee owner of working
farmland property and one or more qualified holders that permits a qualified holder to
control, either directly or indirectly, the purchase price of the working farmland property
for the primary purpose of making available and affordable, and preserving the permanent
availability and affordability of, that property for working farmland.
2. Qualified holder or holder. "Qualified holder" or "holder" means:
A. A governmental entity authorized to hold an interest in real property;
B. A nonprofit organization organized under state law whose purposes include the
permanent protection of working farmland or the enlargement of working farmland
opportunities for farmers; or
C. A nonprofit organization organized under state law whose purposes or powers
include retaining or protecting working farmland or providing access to working
farmland.
3. Third-party right of enforcement. "Third-party right of enforcement" means a
right provided in an option to purchase at agricultural value to enforce any of its terms
granted by the grantor and holder of the option to purchase at agricultural value to a
governmental entity or nonprofit organization that meets the qualifications of a holder.
4. Working farmland or working farmland property. "Working farmland" or
"working farmland property" has the same meaning as in Title 5, section 6201, subsection
4-A.
§142. Creation; conveyance; acceptance; duration; filing
1. Option to purchase at agricultural value. Except as otherwise provided in this
chapter, an option to purchase at agricultural value may be created, conveyed, recorded,
assigned, released, modified, terminated or otherwise altered or affected in the same
manner as other options to purchase real property created by written instrument. An option
to purchase at agricultural value may include a 3rd-party right of enforcement and may be
incorporated into an agricultural easement or be an independent document suitable for
recording.
2. Right or duty. A right or duty in favor of or against a qualified holder may not
arise under an option to purchase at agricultural value unless it is accepted in writing by
the qualified holder.
Page 5 - 132LR0152(03)

3. Limitation. Except as provided in this chapter, an option to purchase at agricultural
value is unlimited in duration unless a change of circumstances renders the option to
purchase at agricultural value no longer in the public interest as determined in an action
under section 143, subsection 2.
4. Filing. An option to purchase at agricultural value must be recorded in the county
registry of deeds, and a copy of the recorded option to purchase at agricultural value must
be filed with the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry together with a
map showing with specificity the location of the affected property on the form or forms
that the department requires.
5. Other interest. An interest in real property in existence at the time an option to
purchase at agricultural value is created is not affected by the option to purchase at
agricultural value unless the fee owner of the interest is a party to the option to purchase at
agricultural value or consents to the option to purchase at agricultural value.
6. Right to enter real property. The written instrument creating an option to purchase
at agricultural value must designate how and when representatives of the holder of an

compliance.

other proceeding at law or in equity.
B. Acting in accordance with charitable trust principles, the court may modify,

must find that, due to a change in circumstance, the option to purchase at agricultural
value no longer serves the public interest in protecting or enhancing the protection of
working farmland or related businesses of the State. The Attorney General must be
made a party to any action under this paragraph, and written notice must be provided
to the Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry.
C. If the court modifies, terminates or denies equitable enforcement of an option to
purchase at agricultural value, the court may order payment by the fee owner of money
or other damages to the holder or the State. The holder or the State shall apply the
same in a manner consistent with the purposes of this law as approved by the court.
