33 have the following meanings.
34 1. Option to purchase at agricultural value. "Option to purchase at agricultural
35 value" means any agreement in recordable form between the fee owner of working
36 farmland property and one or more qualified holders that permits a qualified holder to
37 control, either directly or indirectly, the purchase price of the working farmland property
38 for the primary purpose of making available and affordable, and preserving the permanent
39 availability and affordability of, that property for working farmland.
Page 4 - 132LR0152(01)
1 2. Qualified holder or holder. "Qualified holder" or "holder" means:
2 A. A governmental entity authorized to hold an interest in real property;
3 B. A nonprofit organization organized under state law whose purposes include the
4 permanent protection of working farmland or the enlargement of working farmland
5 opportunities for farmers; or

7 include retaining or protecting working farmland or providing access to working
8 farmland.
9 3. Third-party right of enforcement. "Third-party right of enforcement" means a
10 right provided in an option to purchase at agricultural value to enforce any of its terms
11 granted by the grantor and holder of the option to purchase at agricultural value to a
12 governmental entity or nonprofit organization that meets the qualifications of a holder.
13 4. Working farmland or working farmland property. "Working farmland" or
14 "working farmland property" has the same meaning as in Title 5, section 6201, subsection
15 4-A.
16 §142. Creation; conveyance; acceptance; duration; filing
17 1. Option to purchase at agricultural value. Except as otherwise provided in this
18 chapter, an option to purchase at agricultural value may be created, conveyed, recorded,
19 assigned, released, modified, terminated or otherwise altered or affected in the same
20 manner as other options to purchase real property created by written instrument. An option
21 to purchase at agricultural value may include a 3rd-party right of enforcement and may be
22 incorporated into an agricultural easement or be an independent document suitable for
23 recording.
24 2. Right or duty. A right or duty in favor of or against a qualified holder may not
25 arise under an option to purchase at agricultural value unless it is accepted in writing by
26 the qualified holder.
27 3. Limitation. Except as provided in this chapter, an option to purchase at agricultural
28 value is unlimited in duration unless a change of circumstances renders the option to
29 purchase at agricultural value no longer in the public interest as determined in an action
30 under section 143, subsection 2.
31 4. Filing. An option to purchase at agricultural value must be recorded in the county
32 registry of deeds, and a copy of the recorded option to purchase at agricultural value must
33 be filed with the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry together with a
34 map showing with specificity the location of the affected property on the form or forms
35 that the department requires.
36 5. Other interest. An interest in real property in existence at the time an option to
37 purchase at agricultural value is created is not affected by the option to purchase at
38 agricultural value unless the fee owner of the interest is a party to the option to purchase at
39 agricultural value or consents to the option to purchase at agricultural value.
40 6. Right to enter real property. The written instrument creating an option to purchase
41 at agricultural value must designate how and when representatives of the holder of an
42 option to purchase at agricultural value are entitled to enter the real property to ensure
43 compliance.

14 terminate or deny equitable enforcement of an option to purchase at agricultural value
15 in an action brought by a party under subsection 1. In taking such an action, the court
16 must find that, due to a change in circumstance, the option to purchase at agricultural
17 value no longer serves the public interest in protecting or enhancing the protection of
18 working farmland or related businesses of the State. The Attorney General must be
19 made a party to any action under this paragraph, and written notice must be provided
20 to the Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry.
21 C. If the court modifies, terminates or denies equitable enforcement of an option to
22 purchase at agricultural value, the court may order payment by the fee owner of money
23 or other damages to the holder or the State. The holder or the State shall apply the
24 same in a manner consistent with the purposes of this law as approved by the court.
25 The fact that a working farmland property might be used for more valuable economic
26 purposes may not be considered when determining whether an option to purchase at
27 agricultural value is no longer in the public interest.
28 §144. Scope of option to purchase at agricultural value

1 SUMMARY
22 Part A of this bill amends the laws governing the Land for Maine's Future program and
33 the Land for Maine's Future Board within the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and
44 Forestry in the following ways.
5 1. It defines "interest in property" to include both fee and less-than-fee simple interest
6 for purposes of acquiring property and interests in property.
7 2. It requires the board to provide public notice of its intent to determine the final
8 award for the land offered for acquisition.
9 3. It authorizes the board to use its discretion in determining whether to make an award.
10 4. It provides that the board may not fund the acquisition of a fee interest in land used
11 for commercially harvested or harvestable forest land. Current law does not specify that to
12 be prohibited the acquisition must be of a fee interest.
13 5. It repeals redundant and conflicting provisions of law regarding how the board may
14 use certain funds.
15 6. It requires that land acquired by the board have clear title.
16 7. It removes redundant references to matching requirements and payments to
17 cooperating entities.
18 Part B of the bill authorizes the creation of an option to purchase at agricultural value,
19 which is defined in the bill as an agreement between a fee owner of working farmland
20 property and a governmental entity or nonprofit organization that permits the governmental
21 entity or nonprofit organization to control the purchase price of working farmland property
22 for the purpose of making available and affordable and preserving the permanent
23 availability and affordability of that property as working farmland.
24 Part C of the bill amends the law regarding reporting requirements for conservation
25 easements and parcels of land owned in fee for conservation purposes.

16 §142. Creation; conveyance; acceptance; duration; filing
17 1. Option to purchase at agricultural value. Except as otherwise provided in this
18 chapter, an option to purchase at agricultural value may be created, conveyed, recorded,
19 assigned, released, modified, terminated or otherwise altered or affected in the same

15 in an action brought by a party under subsection 1. In taking such an action, the court

17 value no longer serves the public interest in protecting or enhancing the protection of
18 working farmland or related businesses of the State. The Attorney General must be
19 made a party to any action under this paragraph, and written notice must be provided
20 to the Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry.
21 C. If the court modifies, terminates or denies equitable enforcement of an option to
22 purchase at agricultural value, the court may order payment by the fee owner of money
23 or other damages to the holder or the State. The holder or the State shall apply the
24 same in a manner consistent with the purposes of this law as approved by the court.
25 The fact that a working farmland property might be used for more valuable economic
26 purposes may not be considered when determining whether an option to purchase at
27 agricultural value is no longer in the public interest.

1 SUMMARY
22 Part A of this bill amends the laws governing the Land for Maine's Future program and
33 the Land for Maine's Future Board within the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and
44 Forestry in the following ways.
5 1. It defines "interest in property" to include both fee and less-than-fee simple interest
6 for purposes of acquiring property and interests in property.
7 2. It requires the board to provide public notice of its intent to determine the final
8 award for the land offered for acquisition.
9 3. It authorizes the board to use its discretion in determining whether to make an award.
10 4. It provides that the board may not fund the acquisition of a fee interest in land used
11 for commercially harvested or harvestable forest land. Current law does not specify that to
12 be prohibited the acquisition must be of a fee interest.
13 5. It repeals redundant and conflicting provisions of law regarding how the board may
14 use certain funds.
15 6. It requires that land acquired by the board have clear title.
16 7. It removes redundant references to matching requirements and payments to
17 cooperating entities.
18 Part B of the bill authorizes the creation of an option to purchase at agricultural value,
19 which is defined in the bill as an agreement between a fee owner of working farmland
20 property and a governmental entity or nonprofit organization that permits the governmental
21 entity or nonprofit organization to control the purchase price of working farmland property
22 for the purpose of making available and affordable and preserving the permanent
23 availability and affordability of that property as working farmland.
24 Part C of the bill amends the law regarding reporting requirements for conservation
25 easements and parcels of land owned in fee for conservation purposes.
