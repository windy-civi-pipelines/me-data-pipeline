28 implemented by a large investor-owned transmission and distribution utility to reduce or
29 defer the need for investment in grid infrastructure in the State.
30 SUMMARY
3311 This bill adjusts the time frame for the ongoing submission dates for certain reviews
3322 and reports required of transmission and distribution utilities and the Public Utilities
3333 Commission to align with the integrated grid planning process required pursuant to the
3344 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3147.
35 The bill requires that, beginning May 1, 2027, and every 5 years thereafter, instead of
36 every 3 years as in current law, a transmission and distribution utility is required to submit
37 a 10-year plan that includes specific actions for addressing the expected effects of climate
38 change on the utility's assets needed to transmit and distribute electricity to its customers.
39 Current law requires the Public Utilities Commission to conduct a review, or contract
40 with a consultant to conduct a review, related to available grid-enhancing technology every
41 5 years beginning in 2025. The bill adjusts the schedule of reviews by requiring a review
42 in 2027, and then every 5 years thereafter. The review conducted in 2027 must update the

413 review conducted in 2025. The bill also adds language specifying that a review conducted
424 pursuant to this provision of law may update an earlier review.
