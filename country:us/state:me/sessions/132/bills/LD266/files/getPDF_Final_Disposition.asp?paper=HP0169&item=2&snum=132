25 SUMMARY
2266 This amendment replaces the bill and changes the title. The amendment requires a
2277 registrar to notify a registered voter when a signature made by the registered voter on a
2288 primary petition, nomination petition or petition to initiate proceedings for a people's veto
2299 referendum or the direct initiative of legislation does not match the signature of the
3300 registered voter in the central voter registration system. The registrar must provide the
3311 registered voter with information on how to update the registered voter's signature in the
3322 central voter registration system.
33 The preliminary fiscal impact statement identified a potential unfunded state mandate
34 in the requirements that registrars notify voters whose signatures on a petition do not match

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 169, L.D. 266
315 the signatures in the central voter registration system and to provide the voters with
326 information on updating their signature in the central voter registration system.
3 The committee members who voted in favor of this report reviewed the preliminary
4 fiscal impact statement and determined that because the impact on municipalities is
5 anticipated to be insignificant statewide and that the frequency of such an event occurring
6 is likely to be low the requirement likely will not have significant costs and does not require
7 an expansion or modification of activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures.
