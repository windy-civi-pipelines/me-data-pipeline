12 SUMMARY
1133 This bill eliminates the Governor's Energy Office, creates a new cabinet-level
1144 Department of Energy Resources and transfers the functions of the Governor's Energy
1155 Office to the new department. The Department of Energy Resources has responsibility for
1166 oversight of state energy policies, programs and development efforts, is the designated state
1177 energy office and is directed to assess energy supply and infrastructure needs while aligning
1188 with the State's greenhouse gas reduction targets. The department also administers the
1199 Distributed Solar and Energy Storage Program and the Maine Energy Resources
2200 Development Program and coordinates state energy policy and actively fosters cooperation
2211 with the Efficiency Maine Trust. The bill establishes a process for the conduct of
2222 competitive solicitations by the department.
23 The Commissioner of Energy Resources is appointed by the Governor and is
24 responsible for developing and implementing the comprehensive state energy plan,
25 overseeing energy efficiency efforts and supporting renewable energy goals, including
26 reducing energy costs, increasing renewable energy capacity and lowering oil dependence.
27 The bill establishes the salary range of the commissioner and deputy commissioner, adds
28 the commissioner as a nonvoting member of the board of directors of the Maine
29 Technology Institute and authorizes the commissioner to act as a representative of the State
30 in the regional greenhouse gas initiative. The bill also amends the membership of the
31 Maine State Housing Authority to require that one of the commissioners have expertise in
32 the sustainability requirements for construction projects funded by the authority and
33 amends the at-large membership of the Finance Authority of Maine to require that one of
34 the members be knowledgeable in the field of clean energy finance or technology solutions
35 to climate change.
36 The bill requires the Department of Energy Resources to work with the joint standing
37 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy, utilities and technology
38 matters and staff from the Office of Policy and Legal Analysis and the Office of the Revisor
39 of Statutes to develop legislation to effect the transition of responsibilities from the
40 Governor's Energy Office to the Department of Energy Resources.
