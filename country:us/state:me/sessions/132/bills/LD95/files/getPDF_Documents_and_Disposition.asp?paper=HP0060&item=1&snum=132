24 confidential under this subsection, the commissioner may not disclose the information

27 SUMMARY
2288 This bill repeals certain provisions of law related to special regulations regarding deer
2299 hunting season that are now redundant due to that language being placed in Department of
3300 Inland Fisheries and Wildlife rule. This bill also reorganizes certain laws regarding
3311 rulemaking related to open and closed seasons for deer hunting and clarifies the distinctions
3322 between the expanded archery season and a special hunting season and corrects cross-
3333 references.
34 It also creates a Freedom of Access Act public records exemption by making location
35 data regarding species of special concern confidential in statute, just as location data
36 regarding threatened and endangered species are.
