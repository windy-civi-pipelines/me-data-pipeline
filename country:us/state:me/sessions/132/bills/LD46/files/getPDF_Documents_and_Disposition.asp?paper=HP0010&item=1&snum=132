3 Whereas, this legislation establishes the Inclusive Higher Education Grant Program

8 Medicaid home and community-based services waiver, known as the Lifespan Waiver, to
9 support individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities or autism spectrum
10 disorder; and

22 SUMMARY
2233 This bill establishes a grant program in the Department of Education to increase
2244 postsecondary educational opportunities and support employability for students with
2255 intellectual or developmental disabilities or autism spectrum disorder.
26 Under the grant program, the department awards competitive grants to institutions of
27 higher education in the State to develop and implement program plans that offer students
28 with intellectual or developmental disabilities or autism spectrum disorder, to the greatest
29 extent possible, the same rights, privileges, experiences, benefits and outcomes in a higher
30 education experience as students without disabilities.
31 The bill requires that, in order to receive funding under the grant program, program
32 plans developed by institutions of higher education must meet the requirements of a
33 comprehensive transition and postsecondary program under the federal Higher Education
34 Act of 1965 so that students enrolled in the program plan may be eligible for certain federal
35 grants and work-study programs. The bill requires institutions of higher education to use
36 25% of the funds received through the grant program for scholarships for students
37 participating in the program plan.
38 Finally, the bill requires institutions of higher education that have been awarded grants
39 to make periodic reports to the department concerning the progress and sustainability of
40 their program plans and requires the department to annually report to the Legislature on the
41 effectiveness of the grant program.
