14 increase, if any, as of August of 2025 over August of 2024 in the Consumer Price Index
15 for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, CPI-W, for the Northeast Region, or its
16 successor index, as published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor

34 payment of wages a statement that clearly shows the date of the pay period, the hours, total
35 earnings and itemized deductions. An employer making payment by direct deposit or other
36 means of electronic transfer shall provide each employee with an accurate record of the
37 transfer, including the date of the pay period, the hours, total earnings and itemized
38 deductions, when the transfer is made. If the record is provided in an electronic format, the
39 employer shall provide a method by which the employee may have ready access to the
40 information and print it without cost to the employee. The director or the director's
41 authorized representative may, and upon written complaint shall, enter the place of business
42 or employment of an employer or employee for the purpose of examining and inspecting
43 such records and copy any such records as the director or the director's authorized
