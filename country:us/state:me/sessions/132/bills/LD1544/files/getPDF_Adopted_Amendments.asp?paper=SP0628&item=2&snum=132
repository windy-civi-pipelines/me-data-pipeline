12 'Sec. 4. 22 MRSA §4034, sub-§4, as amended by PL 2015, c. 501, §10, is further
13 amended to read:
14 4. Summary preliminary hearing. The court shall schedule a summary preliminary
15 hearing on a preliminary protection order within 14 days but not less than 7 days after
16 issuance of the preliminary protection order, except that counsel for a parent may request
17 that the hearing take place sooner. Upon request of counsel, the court may conduct the
18 summary preliminary hearing as expeditiously as the court determines the interests of
19 justice require. If a parent, custodian or legal guardian appears for the summary
20 preliminary hearing and does not consent to the preliminary protection order, the court shall
21 conduct a hearing at which the petitioner bears the burden of proof. At a summary
22 preliminary hearing, the court shall consider the trauma to the child of removal from the
23 child's home in determining whether to continue the preliminary protection order and
24 whether the department has exhausted the options to mitigate the immediate risk of serious
25 harm to the child and avoid the removal of the child from the child's home. The court may
26 limit testimony to the testimony of the caseworker, parent, custodian, legal guardian,
27 guardian ad litem, foster parent, preadoptive parent or relative providing care and may
28 admit evidence, including reports and records, that would otherwise be inadmissable
29 inadmissible as hearsay evidence. If after the hearing the court finds by a preponderance
30 of the evidence that returning the child to the child's custodian would place the child in
31 immediate risk of serious harm, it shall make findings explaining why the risk of harm to
32 the child is outweighed by the trauma of the child's removal from the child's home and that
33 the department has exhausted the options to mitigate the immediate risk of serious harm
34 and avoid the removal of the child from the child's home and continue the order or make
35 another disposition under section 4036. If the court's preliminary protection order includes
36 a finding of an aggravating factor, the court may order the department not to commence
37 reunification or to cease reunification, in which case the court shall conduct a hearing on
