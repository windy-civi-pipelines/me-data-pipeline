1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 35-A MRSA §3209-A, sub-§8, as amended by PL 2023, c. 230, §1, is
3 repealed and the following enacted in its place:
4 8. Unused kilowatt-hour credits. Unused kilowatt-hour credits accumulated by a
5 customer participating in a net energy billing arrangement may not expire. Notwithstanding
6 any provision of law to the contrary, a transmission and distribution utility may not charge
7 a customer a fee related to unused kilowatt-hour credits.
8 Sec. 2. 35-A MRSA §3214, sub-§2, ¶B, as amended by PL 2023, c. 230, §2, is
9 further amended to read:
10 B. Set initial funding for programs based on an assessment of aggregate customer need
11 in periodic rate cases. The funding formula may not result in assistance being counted
12 as income or as a resource in other means-tested assistance programs for low-income
13 households. To the extent possible, assistance must be provided in a manner most
14 likely to prevent the loss of other federal assistance; and.
15 Sec. 3. 35-A MRSA §3214, sub-§2, ¶C, as enacted by PL 2023, c. 230, §2, is
16 repealed.
17 SUMMARY
1188 This bill replaces the provision of law that allows the Public Utilities Commission to
1199 adopt rules providing that unused kilowatt-hour credits accumulated by a residential
2200 customer participating in a net energy billing arrangement may expire with a provision that
2211 prohibits the expiration of unused kilowatt-hour credits. The bill also prohibits a
2222 transmission and distribution utility from charging a customer a fee related to unused
2233 kilowatt-hour credits.
