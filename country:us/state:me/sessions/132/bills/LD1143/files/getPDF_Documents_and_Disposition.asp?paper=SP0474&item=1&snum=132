1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 30-A MRSA §4353, sub-§4-B, as amended by PL 1993, c. 627, §1, is
3 further amended to read:
4 4-B. Set-back Setback variance for single-family dwellings. A municipality may
5 adopt an ordinance that permits the board to grant a set-back setback variance for a single-
6 family dwelling. An ordinance adopted under this subsection may permit a variance from
7 a set-back setback requirement only when strict application of the zoning ordinance to the
8 petitioner and the petitioner's property would cause undue hardship. The term "undue
9 hardship" as used in this subsection means:
10 A. The need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not
11 to the general conditions in the neighborhood;
12 B. The granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the locality;
13 C. The hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior owner;
14 D. The granting of the variance will not substantially reduce or impair the use of
15 abutting property; and
16 E. That the granting of a variance is based upon demonstrated need, not convenience,
17 and no other feasible alternative is available.
18 An ordinance adopted under this subsection is strictly limited to permitting a variance from
19 a set-back setback requirement for a single-family dwelling that is the primary year-round
20 residence of the petitioner. A variance under this subsection may not exceed 20% of a set-
21 back setback requirement and may not be granted if the variance would cause the area of
22 the dwelling to exceed the maximum permissible lot coverage. An ordinance may allow
23 for a variance under this subsection to exceed 20% of a set-back setback requirement,
24 except for minimum setbacks from a wetland or water body required within shoreland
25 zones by rules adopted pursuant to Title 38, chapter 3, subchapter I 1, article 2‑B, if the
26 petitioner has obtained the written consent of an affected abutting landowner.
27 Sec. 2. 30-A MRSA §4353, sub-§4-C, ¶F, as enacted by PL 1997, c. 148, §2, is
28 amended to read:
29 F. The property is not wholly located in whole or in part within shoreland areas as
30 described in Title 38, section 435.
31 SUMMARY
3322 This bill changes references to a single-family dwelling in the law regarding setback
3333 variances to a dwelling. It also changes the law governing variances from dimensional
3344 standards to allow a variance when there is a practical difficulty and the property is not
3355 wholly located within a shoreland area.
