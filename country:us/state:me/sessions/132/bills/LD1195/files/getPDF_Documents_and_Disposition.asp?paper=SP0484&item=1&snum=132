1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 39-A MRSA §403, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2017, c. 401, §1, is further
3 amended by amending the first blocked paragraph to read:
4 Except as provided in subsection 5, paragraph A‑1, a self-insurer may, with the approval
5 of the Superintendent of Insurance, use the following types of security to satisfy the self-
6 insurer's responsibility to post security required by the superintendent: a surety bond; an
7 irrevocable standby letter of credit; cash deposits and acceptable securities; and an
8 actuarially determined fully funded trust. For purposes of this section, "tangible net worth"
9 means equity less assets that have no physical existence and depend on expected future
10 benefits for their ascribed value. Unless disapproved by the superintendent pursuant to
11 paragraph C, subparagraphs (5) and (6), a group self-insurer that maintains a trust
12 actuarially funded to the confidence level required by the superintendent may use an
13 irrevocable standby letter of credit as follows: only in an amount not greater than the
14 difference between the funding to the required confidence level and funding to the
15 confidence level reduced by 10 percentage points; only as long as the trust assets are not
16 used as collateral for the letter of credit; and only as long as the value of trust assets,
17 excluding the value of the letter of credit, is at least equal to the present value, evaluated to
18 the 65% confidence level, of ultimate incurred claims, claims settlement costs and, if
19 determined necessary by the superintendent, administrative costs.
20 Sec. 2. 39-A MRSA §403, sub-§3, ¶A, as amended by PL 2017, c. 401, §1, is
21 further amended by amending the 3rd blocked paragraph to read:
22 The irrevocable standby letter of credit must be the individual obligation of the issuing
23 financial institution, may not be subject to any agreement, condition, qualification or
24 defense between the financial institution and the employer or group and may not in any
25 way be contingent on reimbursement by the employer or group. If the rating of an
26 issuing financial institution that has issued an irrevocable standby letter of credit
27 pursuant to this section falls below the required standard, the employer or group shall
28 obtain a new irrevocable standby letter of credit from a qualified financial institution
29 or shall provide other eligible security of equal value approved by the Superintendent
30 of Insurance. The irrevocable standby letter of credit is automatically extended for one
31 year from the date of expiration unless, at least 90 days prior to any expiration date, the
32 issuing financial institution notifies the Superintendent of Insurance that the financial
33 institution elects not to renew the irrevocable standby letter of credit.
34 Sec. 3. 39-A MRSA §403, sub-§3, ¶A, as amended by PL 2017, c. 401, §1, is
35 further amended by amending the 4th blocked paragraph to read:
36 An irrevocable standby letter of credit that has been issued by a qualified financial
37 institution and accepted by the Superintendent of Insurance binds the issuing financial
38 institution to pay one or more drafts drawn by the Treasurer of State, as directed by the
39 superintendent, as long as the draft does not exceed the total amount of the irrevocable
40 standby letter of credit. Any draft presented by the Treasurer of State, as directed by
41 the superintendent, must be promptly honored if accompanied by the certification of
42 the superintendent that any obligation under this chapter has not been paid when due
43 or that a proceeding in bankruptcy has been initiated by or with respect to the employer
44 or group in a court of competent jurisdiction.

1 Sec. 4. 39-A MRSA §403, sub-§3, ¶A, as amended by PL 2017, c. 401, §1, is
2 further amended by repealing the 5th blocked paragraph.
3 Sec. 5. 39-A MRSA §403, sub-§3, ¶A, as amended by PL 2017, c. 401, §1, is
4 further amended by repealing the 6th blocked paragraph.
5 Sec. 6. 39-A MRSA §403, sub-§3, ¶A, as amended by PL 2017, c. 401, §1, is
6 further amended by repealing the 7th blocked paragraph.
7 Sec. 7. 39-A MRSA §403, sub-§3, ¶A-1 is enacted to read:
8 A-1. The Superintendent of Insurance may instruct the Treasurer of State to draw on
9 an irrevocable standby letter of credit if:
10 (1) Any obligation under this chapter has not been paid by the employer or group
11 when due;
12 (2) A proceeding in bankruptcy has been initiated by or with respect to the
13 employer or group in a court of competent jurisdiction; or
14 (3) The following conditions have been met:
15 (a) The superintendent has received notice that that the financial institution
16 elects not to renew the irrevocable standby letter of credit;
17 (b) The self-insurer has had at least 15 days’ notice to replace the security with
18 other eligible security of equal value approved by the superintendent; and
19 (c) The self-insurer has not replaced the irrevocable standby letter of credit
20 with a new letter of credit or other approved security.
21 The issuing financial institution shall promptly honor a draft on an irrevocable standby
22 letter presented by the Treasurer of State. Any proceeds from a draw on such an
23 irrevocable standby letter of credit by the treasurer must be held by the treasurer on
24 behalf of workers' compensation claimants to secure payment of claims until either the
25 superintendent authorizes the treasurer to release those proceeds to the employer or
26 group upon provision by the employer or group of replacement security adequate to
27 meet the requirements for security set by the superintendent, or the superintendent
28 directs distribution of the proceeds in accordance with this Title.
29 To the extent not inconsistent with state law, the letter of credit is subject to and
30 governed by the International Standby Practices 1998 or successor practices governing
31 standby letters of credit duly adopted by the International Chamber of Commerce. If
32 any legal proceedings are initiated with respect to payment of the letter of credit, those
33 proceedings are subject to the State's courts and law.
34 Sec. 8. 39-A MRSA §403, sub-§3, ¶C, as amended by PL 2017, c. 401, §1, is
35 further amended to read:
36 C. A self-insurer may establish an actuarially determined fully funded trust, funded at
37 a level sufficient to discharge those obligations incurred by the employer pursuant to
38 this Act as they become due and payable from time to time, as long as the
39 Superintendent of Insurance requires that the value of unencumbered trust assets be at
40 least equal to the present value of ultimate expected incurred claims and claims
41 settlement costs, plus required safety margins and, if determined necessary by the
42 superintendent, administrative costs for the operation of the plan of self-insurance. For
Page 2 - 132LR0624(01)

413 the purpose of determining whether a group self-insurer's actuarially determined fully
424 funded trust has a surplus of funds in excess of that is fully funded as required by this
435 subsection, the superintendent shall consider, based upon the group's audit for all
446 completed plan years, only the following assets held outside the trust account: cash up
457 to $10,000; accounts receivable, limited to amounts collected and deposited in the trust
468 account by the date of the surplus distribution; accrued interest on trust account assets
479 that will be collected and deposited in the trust account within 6 months from the date
580 of the surplus determination; tangible assets that will be converted to cash and
591 deposited in the trust account prior to the distribution date of any surplus; and a letter
1502 of credit to be used to partially fund the trust to the extent allowed under this section
1513 and rules adopted by the superintendent, as supported in the actuarial review. The
1524 superintendent shall consider cash held outside the trust account in excess of $10,000
1535 if the self-insurer provides, to the superintendent's satisfaction, documentation
1546 regarding why the money is being held outside the trust account. An actuarially
1557 determined fully funded trust must be funded as follows, as determined by the
1568 superintendent.
17 (1) For individual and group self-insurers, the amount of security must be
18 determined based upon an actuarial review. The actuarial review must take into
19 consideration the use by a group self-insurer of any irrevocable standby letter of
20 credit. Except as provided in subparagraph (3), initial funding for each plan year
21 must be maintained at the 90% or higher confidence level. Funding after the
22 completion of the initial plan year may be established no lower than the 75%
23 confidence level if the following has occurred:
24 (a) A year considered for reduction is completed;
25 (b) The supporting actuarial review includes an evaluation of the completed
26 year experience with claims evaluated not less than 6 months from the end of
27 the plan year, or in the case of a group self-insurer in existence for at least 36
28 months, not less than 4 months from the end of the plan year; and
29 (c) For individual self-insurers, prior approval from the superintendent is
30 obtained.
31 For the purposes of determining the confidence level, all completed years at the
32 same confidence level may be aggregated. For individual self-insurers, funds may
33 not be released from the trust or transferred between years except as approved by
34 the superintendent. The governing body of a group self-insurer may at any time
35 declare a surplus of funds above the required confidence level, but may only release
36 funds after the completion of any plan year. The superintendent may request
37 information regarding any such declaration. Any distribution of surplus must be
38 based upon an actuarial review of all outstanding obligations for all completed plan
39 years, an audited financial statement of the group for all completed plan years and
40 a surplus distribution worksheet for all completed plan years on a form approved
41 by the superintendent. The group self-insurer must provide the required
42 information within 10 days after the distribution. Any surplus declared or
43 distributed pursuant to this paragraph is subject to adjustment after review by the
44 superintendent within 60 days of the receipt of the required information. Any
45 deficit below the required confidence level, as determined by the superintendent,
Page 3 - 132LR0624(01)

416 that results from a distribution under this paragraph must be funded within 45 days
427 from the date of the notice by the superintendent.
3 (1-A) A group self-insurer may secure its obligations to the confidence level
4 required by the superintendent in the following manner:
5 (a) The obligations must be secured by an actuarially determined fully funded
6 trust with unencumbered assets at least equal to the present value of ultimate
7 expected incurred claims and claims settlement costs, or such higher amount
8 as the superintendent may require in accordance with subparagraphs (5) and
9 (6); and
10 (b) The balance may be secured by a letter of credit complying with paragraph
11 A.
12 (2) A group self-insurer may elect to fund at a higher confidence level through the
13 use of cash, marketable securities or reinsurance. If a member of a group self-
14 insurer terminates membership in the group for any reason, that member shall fund
15 the member's proportionate share of the liabilities and obligations of the trust to the
16 95% confidence level. If for any reason the departing member fails to fund the
17 member's proportionate share of the trust's exposure to the 95% level of
18 confidence, the trust is responsible for that member's liabilities and obligations to
19 the trust. If the superintendent finds that a material risk to the trust's ability to
20 satisfy its liabilities and obligations in full exists due to the failure of one or more
21 departing members to fund the departing members' proportionate share of those
22 liabilities and obligations to the 95% confidence level or due to the failure of the
23 group trust to enforce the funding requirement, the superintendent shall consider
24 the unfunded share of the trust's exposure when approving a determination of a
25 surplus or deficit in the trust.
26 (3) Subject to prior approval by the superintendent in accordance with
27 subparagraph (5), a self-insurer that has successfully maintained an actuarially
28 determined fully funded trust for a period of 5 or more consecutive years may fund
29 all years, including the prospective fund year, at the 75% or higher confidence level
30 in the aggregate and a group self-insurer that has successfully maintained an
31 actuarially determined fully funded trust for a period of 10 or more consecutive
32 years may fund all years, including the prospective fund year, at the 65% or higher
33 confidence level in the aggregate.
34 (4) Trust assets must consist of cash or marketable securities of a type and risk
35 character as specified in subsection 9. The trustee shall submit a report to the
36 superintendent not less frequently than quarterly that lists the assets comprising the
37 corpus of the trust, including a statement of their market value and the investment
38 activity during the period covered by the report. The trust must be established and
39 maintained subject to the condition that trust assets may not be transferred or revert
40 in any manner to the employer except to the extent that the superintendent finds
41 that the value of the trust assets exceeds the present value of incurred claims and
42 claims settlement costs with an actuarially indicated margin for future loss
43 development. In all other respects, the trust instrument, including terms for
44 certification, funding, designation of trustee and payout, must be as approved by
45 the superintendent, except that the value of the trust account must be actuarially
Page 4 - 132LR0624(01)

416 calculated at least annually by a casualty actuary who is a member of the American
427 Academy of Actuaries and adjusted to the required level of funding.
3 (5) In determining whether a self-insurer that maintains an actuarially determined
4 fully funded trust qualifies for a reduction in the required confidence level pursuant
5 to subparagraph (1) or (3) or is subject to an enhanced confidence level pursuant
6 to subparagraph (6), the superintendent shall consider the financial condition of the
7 self-insurer in relation to the potential workers' compensation liabilities. The
8 factors the superintendent may consider include the self-insurer's liquidity,
9 leverage, tangible net worth, size and net income. For group self-insurers, the
10 superintendent's review must be based on the aggregate financial condition of the
11 group members. At the request of the superintendent, a group self-insurer shall
12 report relevant financial information, on a form prescribed by the superintendent,
13 at such intervals as the superintendent directs. The superintendent may establish
14 additional review criteria or procedures by rule. Rules adopted pursuant to this
15 subparagraph are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375,
16 subchapter 2‑A.
17 (6) If the superintendent determines, based on an evaluation of a self-insurer's
18 financial condition pursuant to subparagraph (5), that the confidence level at which
19 the self-insurer has been authorized to fund its trust is not sufficient to provide
20 adequate security for the self-insurer's reasonably anticipated potential workers'
21 compensation liabilities, the superintendent shall make a determination of the
22 appropriate confidence level and order the self-insurer to take prompt action to
23 increase funding to that level within 60 days.
24 Sec. 9. 39-A MRSA §403, sub-§4-A, ¶L, as enacted by PL 2009, c. 232, §2, is
25 amended by amending subparagraph (1) to read:
26 (1) Any out-of-state self-insurer that participates in the account may do so only
27 through participation in a protected cell. An employer or group authorized by the
28 Superintendent of Insurance to self-insure its Maine liabilities pursuant to this
29 section is considered an out-of-state insurer self-insurer to the extent that it is
30 reinsuring out-of-state liabilities beyond the scope of its Maine self-insurance plan.
31 Sec. 10. 39-A MRSA §403, sub-§5, ¶A-1, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 401, §3, is
32 amended by amending subparagraph (2) to read:
33 (2) If the principal member does not have employees in the State, the principal
34 member must meet the same qualifications as a subsidiary employer applying to
35 become qualified parent corporation of an individual self-insurer under subsection
36 3, paragraph G, except that direct majority ownership is not required and the
37 group's indemnity agreement is deemed to meet the requirement for an irrevocable
38 contract of assignment.
39 Sec. 11. 39-A MRSA §403, sub-§11, as enacted by PL 1991, c. 885, Pt. A, §8 and
40 affected by §§9 to 11, is amended to read:
41 11. Qualifications for reinsurance carriers. A workers' compensation contract or
42 policy issued after the effective date of this section January 1, 1993 may not be recognized
43 by the Superintendent of Insurance in considering the ability of an individual or group self-
44 insurer to fulfill its financial obligations under this Act, unless the contract or policy is
Page 5 - 132LR0624(01)

415 issued by an admitted insurance company or a reinsurance company that meets on a
426 continuous basis the requirements of Title 24‑A, chapter 9, subchapter III 3 and the
437 reinsurance company has been approved by the superintendent to issue in this State
448 contracts of primary workers' compensation reinsurance, or by Lloyd's of London, a
459 syndicate of unincorporated alien insurers that has established and maintains United States
560 trust funds consistent with the requirements of Title 24‑A, chapter 9, subchapter III
571 formally organized association of incorporated underwriters and individual unincorporated
582 underwriters, any one or more of which underwrite and assume as insurer a portion of the
593 risk insured by them as set forth in the contract of insurance. Each contract of primary
1504 workers' compensation reinsurance that is proposed for use in this State must be filed for
1515 approval in the manner set out in Title 24‑A, section 2412. Insofar as is To the extent
1526 practicable, a contract so approved may be modified with less than 30 days advance filing
1537 notice if the superintendent determines the modifications suggested are not contrary to
1548 provisions of Title 24‑A, section 2412, this Title or Bureau of Insurance Rule Chapter 250
1559 and are necessary to effect required reinsurance coverage to authorize the self-insurer to
1660 operate a plan of workers' compensation self-insurance.
17 Sec. 12. 39-A MRSA §403, sub-§14, ¶F-1 is enacted to read:
18 F-1. After terminating or suspending an authorization for self-insurance in accordance
19 with this subsection, the Superintendent of Insurance shall promptly notify the board
20 and forward to it a copy of the order terminating or suspending the authorization.
