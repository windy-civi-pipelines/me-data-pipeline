34 Sec. 8. 22 MRSA §1066, sub-§5, as enacted by PL 2009, c. 595, §2, is amended to

36 5. Assessments. By January 1, 2011 and annually thereafter, the board shall determine
37 an assessment for each assessed entity in accordance with this subsection. The board shall

39 board may conduct an audit of the number of covered life months for children individuals

Page 1 - 132LR0253(01)
411 subsection is an adjudicatory proceeding within the meaning of Title 5, chapter 375,
422 subchapter 4.
3 A. In determining the amount of the assessment, the board shall:
4 (1) Determine the total costs of the fund for the succeeding program year;
5 (2) Add a reserve of up to 10% of the total costs of the fund under subparagraph
6 (1) for unanticipated costs associated with providing vaccines to children
7 individuals covered by the assessed entity;
8 (3) Subtract the amount of any unexpended assessments collected in the preceding
9 year and any unexpended interest accrued to the fund during the preceding year;
10 and
11 (4) Calculate the assessment on a monthly basis per child individual to be paid by
12 an assessed entity by dividing the amount determined in accordance with
13 subparagraphs (1), (2) and (3) by the number of children individuals projected to
14 be covered by the assessed entity during the succeeding program year divided by
15 12.
16 B. The board shall provide the assessed entity with notice of the assessment amount
17 for the succeeding program year no later than January 1, 2011 and annually thereafter.
18 C. Beginning July 1, 2011, the assessment must be paid on a quarterly basis as follows:
19 (1) An assessed entity shall pay a quarterly assessment equal to the monthly
20 assessment rate per child individual as described under paragraph A, subparagraph
21 (4) multiplied by the number of child individual member months covered by the
22 assessed entity in the preceding calendar quarter; and
23 (2) The assessment must be paid within 45 days following the close of the calendar
24 quarter.
25 D. After the close of a program year, the board shall reconcile the total assessments
26 paid by assessed entities, including interim assessments determined under paragraph
27 E, with the actual costs of vaccines provided under the program to children individuals
28 covered by assessed entities during that program year and the annual operating
29 expenses of the program during that program year. Any unexpended assessments must
30 be used to reduce the assessment in the succeeding program year as required under
31 paragraph A, subparagraph (3).
32 E. The board may determine an interim assessment for new vaccines that the board
33 has made available through the program pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph E. The

36 following the establishment of the federal contract price. The board may not impose
37 more than one interim assessment per year, except in the case of a public health
38 emergency declared in accordance with state or federal law.
39 F. If the combination of funding available from the United States Department of Health
40 and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Vaccines for
41 Children Program and the immunization grant program under the federal Public Health
42 Service Act, Section 1928 of the Social Security Act, 42 United States Code, Section
43 1396s is insufficient to provide coverage for vaccines for the children who qualify for
Page 2 - 132LR0253(01)
414 vaccines under the Vaccines for Children Program, money from the fund may not be
425 used to cover the cost of vaccines for children who would otherwise be provided
436 vaccines under the Vaccines for Children Program.
4 G. If the assessments under this subsection are insufficient to cover the cost of vaccines
5 to be provided to children individuals covered by assessed entities, the State is not
6 required to cover the cost of vaccines for those children individuals.
7 Sec. 9. 22 MRSA §1066, sub-§7, as enacted by PL 2009, c. 595, §2, is amended to

14 and invest the fund in conformance with prudent investor standards and maintain complete
15 records of all assets, investments, deposits, disbursements and other transactions of the
16 fund. All money and securities in the fund must be held in trust by the Treasurer of State
17 for the purpose of making payments under this section and are not money or property for
18 the general use of the State. The Treasurer of State is the custodian of the fund and may
19 make disbursements only upon written direction from the board or the service agent. All
20 assessments collected pursuant to this section, all interest on the balance in the fund and all
21 income from any other source must be deposited into the fund. The fund does not lapse.

28 immunizations for children individuals and the assets, investments and expenditures of the
29 fund.
