for children individuals as reported by an assessed entity. An assessment determination
made pursuant to this subsection is an adjudicatory proceeding within the meaning of Title
5, chapter 375, subchapter 4.
A. In determining the amount of the assessment, the board shall, as it determines
appropriate following a public hearing, establish one or more subfunds by age and
coverage type and, for each subfund:
(1) Determine the total costs of the fund subfund for the succeeding program year;
(2) Add a reserve of up to 10% of the total costs of the fund subfund under
subparagraph (1) for unanticipated costs associated with providing vaccines to
children individuals covered by the assessed entity;
(2-A) Add an administrative allowance for the department of up to 10% of the
total costs of the subfund;
(3) Subtract the amount of any unexpended assessments collected in the preceding
year and any unexpended interest accrued to the fund subfund during the preceding
year; and
(4) Calculate the assessment on a monthly basis per child individual to be paid by
an assessed entity by dividing the amount determined in accordance with
subparagraphs (1), (2), (2-A) and (3) by the number of children individuals
projected to be covered by the assessed entity during the succeeding program year
divided by 12.
B. The board shall provide the assessed entity with notice of the assessment amount
for each subfund established pursuant to paragraph A for the succeeding program year
no later than January 1, 2011 and annually thereafter.
C. Beginning July 1, 2011 2025, the assessment must be paid on a quarterly basis as
follows:
(1) An assessed entity shall pay a quarterly assessment for each subfund
established pursuant to paragraph A equal to the monthly assessment rate per child
individual as described under paragraph A, subparagraph (4) multiplied by the
number of child individual member months covered by the assessed entity in the
preceding calendar quarter; and
(2) The assessment must be paid within 45 days following the close of the calendar
quarter.
D. After the close of a program year, the board shall reconcile the total assessments
paid by assessed entities, including interim assessments determined under paragraph

covered by assessed entities during that program year and the annual operating
expenses of the program during that program year. Any unexpended assessments must
Page 3 - 132LR0253(04)

be used to reduce the assessment for the respective subfund established pursuant to
paragraph A in the succeeding program year as required under paragraph A,
subparagraph (3).
E. The board may determine an interim assessment for new vaccines that the board
has made available through the program pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph E. The
board shall calculate the interim assessment in accordance with paragraph A, and the
interim assessment is payable the calendar quarter that begins no less than 30 days
following the establishment of the federal contract price. The board may not impose
more than one interim assessment per year, except in the case of a public health
emergency declared in accordance with state or federal law.

and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Vaccines for
Children Program and the immunization grant program under the federal Public Health
Service Act, Section 1928 of the Social Security Act, 42 United States Code, Section
1396s is insufficient to provide coverage for vaccines for the children who qualify for
vaccines under the Vaccines for Children Program, money from the fund may not be
used to cover the cost of vaccines for children who would otherwise be provided
vaccines under the Vaccines for Children Program.
G. If the assessments under this subsection are insufficient to cover the cost of vaccines
to be provided to children individuals covered by assessed entities, the State is not
required to cover the cost of vaccines for those children individuals.
H. For any subfund established pursuant to paragraph A after June 2025, after one year
of operation and until discontinued by a 2/3 vote of the board determining that the
adjustments described in this paragraph are not needed to maintain equity in assessment
allocations among assessed entities, the following apply:
(1) Annually, assessed entities shall supply such data as may be determined by the
board to be necessary for the purposes of this subsection and reasonably convenient
for the assessed entities to supply in order to enable the calculations of the AAF
for each entity, to multiply by the otherwise applicable assessment amount to adjust
for variations between entities in the split between participating and
nonparticipating providers in vaccine costs of that entity's covered individuals.
The service agent shall compute the AAF annually for each entity based on
supplied data;
(2) Annually, AAF calculations must be completed during the first quarter of each
calendar year; and
(3) Each assessment amount otherwise calculated in accordance with this
subsection must be multiplied by the AAF for the respective entity to compute the
final assessment due.
