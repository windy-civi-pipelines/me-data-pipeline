9 SUMMARY
1100 This bill provides that, beginning July 1, 2027, a designated food waste generator may
1111 not dispose of its generated food waste at an incineration facility or solid waste landfill and
1122 must to the maximum extent practicable reduce the volume of food waste it generates,
1133 separate and arrange for the donation of excess edible food and manage the remaining food
1144 waste it generates through agricultural use, composting or anaerobic digestion at the point
1155 of generation, at a different location or by transferring the food waste to an organics
1166 recycler for management. The Department of Environmental Protection may approve a
1177 temporary waiver from these requirements for a designated food waste generator based on
1188 undue hardship for a period not to exceed 3 years.
19 The bill specifies that whether a person is considered a designated food waste generator
20 is based on the average amount of food waste generated weekly by the person. Beginning
21 July 1, 2027 and until June 30, 2029, a designated food waste generator is a person that
22 generates an annual average of 2 or more tons per week of food waste and that is located
23 within 20 miles of an organics recycler with available capacity. Beginning July 1, 2029, a
24 designated food waste generator is a person that generates an annual average of one or more
25 tons per week of food waste and that is located within 25 miles of an organics recycler with
26 available capacity. The bill specifies that, not earlier than July 1, 2032, the department may
27 adopt rules providing that a designated food waste generator includes a person that
28 generates an annual average of less than one ton but greater than 100 pounds per week of
29 food waste or that is located farther than 25 miles from an organics recycler with available
30 capacity. The bill also makes changes to the State's food recovery hierarchy and clarifies
31 the state waste disposal reduction goal.

1 If the department adopts rules pursuant to this paragraph, the department may by rule

9 SUMMARY
1100 This bill provides that, beginning July 1, 2027, a designated food waste generator may
1111 not dispose of its generated food waste at an incineration facility or solid waste landfill and
1122 must to the maximum extent practicable reduce the volume of food waste it generates,
1133 separate and arrange for the donation of excess edible food and manage the remaining food
1144 waste it generates through agricultural use, composting or anaerobic digestion at the point
1155 of generation, at a different location or by transferring the food waste to an organics
1166 recycler for management. The Department of Environmental Protection may approve a
1177 temporary waiver from these requirements for a designated food waste generator based on
1188 undue hardship for a period not to exceed 3 years.
19 The bill specifies that whether a person is considered a designated food waste generator
20 is based on the average amount of food waste generated weekly by the person. Beginning
21 July 1, 2027 and until June 30, 2029, a designated food waste generator is a person that
22 generates an annual average of 2 or more tons per week of food waste and that is located
23 within 20 miles of an organics recycler with available capacity. Beginning July 1, 2029, a
24 designated food waste generator is a person that generates an annual average of one or more
25 tons per week of food waste and that is located within 25 miles of an organics recycler with
26 available capacity. The bill specifies that, not earlier than July 1, 2032, the department may
27 adopt rules providing that a designated food waste generator includes a person that
28 generates an annual average of less than one ton but greater than 100 pounds per week of
29 food waste or that is located farther than 25 miles from an organics recycler with available
30 capacity. The bill also makes changes to the State's food recovery hierarchy and clarifies
31 the state waste disposal reduction goal.
