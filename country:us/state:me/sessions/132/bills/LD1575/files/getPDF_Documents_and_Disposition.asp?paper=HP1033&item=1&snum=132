1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the salary for Legislators is currently paid in equal payments every 2 weeks
4 over the length of the legislative session based on statutory adjournment; and
5 Whereas, this compressed payment method means that no salary is received for the
6 rest of the year; and
7 Whereas, this legislation is immediately necessary to allow Legislators presently in
8 office to better plan for future expenses; and
9 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
10 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
11 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
12 therefore,
13 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
14 Sec. 1. 3 MRSA §2, first ¶, as amended by PL 2023, c. 446, §1, is further amended

12 SUMMARY
1133 Under current practice, a Legislator receives the salary for a biennium divided into
1144 equal payments spread out over the legislative session, beginning at the start of the session
1155 and ending on the date of statutory adjournment for that session with the balance paid at
1166 the end of each session. This bill allows a Legislator to opt to be paid over the length of
1177 the year in an amount equal to the payment due for that session divided into 26 equal
1188 payments.
