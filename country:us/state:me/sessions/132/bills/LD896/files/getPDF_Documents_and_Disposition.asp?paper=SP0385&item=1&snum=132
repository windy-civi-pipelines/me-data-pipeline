1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 22 MRSA ยง3174-G, sub-ยง5 is enacted to read:
3 5. Continuous coverage of children under 6 years of age. Upon the approval of the
4 federal Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
5 Services, the department shall adopt rules to establish the continuous eligibility of a child
6 from birth through 5 years of age. A child who is eligible for and enrolls in Medicaid or the
7 Children's Health Insurance Program established in section 3174-T is eligible to receive
8 continuous coverage through Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program,
9 regardless of the family's change in income. Continuous eligibility must be maintained
10 through the end of the month in which the child attains 6 years of age.
11 A child's eligibility to receive continuous coverage under this subsection must be
12 redetermined or terminated if:
13 A. The child is no longer a resident of the State;
14 B. The child's parent or legal guardian requests termination of the child's eligibility;
15 C. The child dies; or
16 D. The department determines that the child's eligibility was erroneously granted at
17 the most recent determination, redetermination or renewal of eligibility because of
18 agency error, fraud, abuse or perjury.
19 Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5,
20 chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
21 Sec. 2. Department to apply for federal approval. The Department of Health
22 and Human Services shall, by December 31, 2025, apply to the federal Department of
23 Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for a waiver or
24 demonstration project or to amend a pending or current waiver or demonstration project to
25 provide continuous eligibility for a child from birth through 5 years of age who is eligible
26 for and enrolls in the MaineCare program.
27 SUMMARY

2299 31, 2025, to the federal Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare
3300 and Medicaid Services for a waiver or demonstration project or to amend a pending or
3311 current waiver or demonstration project to provide continuous eligibility to a child from
3322 birth through 5 years of age who is eligible for and enrolls in the Medicaid program. Upon

3366 in income. Continuous eligibility must be maintained through the end of the month in which
3377 the child attains 6 years of age, but a child's eligibility to receive continuous coverage must
3388 be redetermined or terminated if the child is no longer a resident of the State, the child's
3399 parent or legal guardian requests termination of the child's eligibility, the child dies or the
4400 department determines that the child's eligibility was erroneously granted at the most recent
4411 determination, redetermination or renewal of eligibility because of agency error, fraud,
4422 abuse or perjury.
