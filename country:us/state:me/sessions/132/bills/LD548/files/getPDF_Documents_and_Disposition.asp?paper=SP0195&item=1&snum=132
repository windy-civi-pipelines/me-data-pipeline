17 milligrams or less per 16 ounce or greater bottle or can to be sold only as an individual
18 bottle or can. The bill would prohibit the sale of intoxicating hemp products and beverages
19 containing one or more intoxicating cannabinoids, including, but not limited to, delta-8
20 tetrahydrocannabinol, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, tetrahydrocannabinol-O-acetate and
21 tetrahydrocannabiphorol in concentrations in the aggregate of 5 milligrams or less per 16
22 ounce or greater bottle or can to be sold as an individual bottle or can, to persons under 21
23 years of age and require that such products meet certain testing, packaging and labeling
24 standards to protect public health and safety.
25 The bill would remove the restriction on manufacturing hemp products contained in
26 the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 28-B, section 502, subsection 1-A and would expressly
27 authorize licensed adult use cannabis products manufacturing facilities to ship intoxicating
28 hemp products outside of the State for sale in other markets, subject to all other applicable
29 laws, including federal law, in the jurisdiction where those products are sold.
