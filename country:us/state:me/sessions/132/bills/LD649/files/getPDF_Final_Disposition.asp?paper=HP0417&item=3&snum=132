An Act to Certify Chiropractic Assistants Who Perform X-rays as
Chiropractic Radiographers
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
Sec. 1. 32 MRSA §451, sub-§3-A is enacted to read:
3-A. Chiropractic radiographer. "Chiropractic radiographer" means a licensed
chiropractic assistant who has been issued a certificate pursuant to section 559.
Sec. 2. 32 MRSA §451, sub-§3-B is enacted to read:
3-B. Chiropractic radiography. "Chiropractic radiography" means the use of
ionizing radiation on human beings for chiropractic diagnostic purposes while under the
supervision and control of a chiropractor in accordance with this chapter.
Sec. 3. 32 MRSA §555, as amended by PL 1993, c. 600, Pt. A, §52, is further
amended to read:
§555. Assistants
This chapter does not prohibit an individual from rendering ancillary diagnostic or
therapeutic services as used in chiropractic practice, other than the adjustive or
manipulative techniques, if those services are rendered under the supervision and control
of a licensed chiropractor as long as that individual has successfully completed a training
program recognized by the board. "Supervision and control" may not be construed as
requiring the personal presence of the supervising and controlling chiropractor at the place
where those services are rendered, unless physical presence is necessary to provide patient
care of the same quality as provided by the chiropractor. This chapter does not prohibit a
chiropractor from delegating to an employee certain activities relating to the care and
treatment being performed by custom and usage when those activities are under the direct
control of and in the presence of the chiropractor. The chiropractor delegating those
activities to an employee, to a program graduate or to a participant in an approved training
program is legally liable for those activities performed by such an individual, and that
individual is considered to be the chiropractor's agent. A chiropractic assistant may
practice chiropractic radiography as long as the chiropractic assistant has been issued a
certificate as a chiropractic radiographer pursuant to section 559.
