10 for persons with intellectual disabilities, the department may establish rules for the
11 administration of medication as it considers necessary. In establishing rules for each type
12 of facility, the department shall consider, among other factors, the general health of the
13 persons likely to receive medication, the number of persons served by the facility and the
14 number of persons employed at the facility who might be involved in the administration of
15 medication. Any rules for the administration of medication must be established in

25 facilities for persons with intellectual disabilities may be performed by unlicensed
26 personnel when these personnel have received appropriate training and instruction and the

35 The term of a full license may not exceed 2 years.

23 8. Right of entry and inspection of ICF/IID. The department and any duly
24 designated officer or employee of the department has the right to enter the premises of an
25 ICF/IID licensed under this section at any reasonable time in order to determine whether
26 the ICF/IID is complying with this section and any rules adopted pursuant to this section.

5 used per week or per month within the ICF/IID group facility. The department may suspend

7 either classification of ICF/IID indicates deficiencies that are related to client care and that
8 arise from the sharing of staff.
9 11. Notice of voluntary closure. Any person, including a county or local
10 governmental unit, that is conducting, managing or operating an ICF/IID and that is

35 violate this section or department rules issued pursuant to this section that, in the opinion
36 of the commissioner, immediately endanger the health or safety of the clients of the ICF/IID
37 or create an emergency, the department by its duly authorized agents may request, under
38 the emergency proceeding provisions of Title 4, section 184, subsection 6, that the District
39 Court suspend or revoke the ICF/IID's license.

24 Sec. 5. 22 MRSA §8752, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2011, c. 542, Pt. A, §48, is
25 further amended to read:
26 2. Health care facility. "Health care facility" or "facility" means a state institution as
27 defined under Title 34‑B, chapter 1 or a health care facility licensed by the division, except
28 that it does not include a facility licensed as a nursing facility or licensed under chapter
29 1664. "Health care facility" includes a general and specialty hospital, an ambulatory
30 surgical facility, and an end-stage renal disease facility and an intermediate care facility for
31 persons with intellectual disabilities or other developmental disabilities.
32 SUMMARY
3333 This bill updates the provision of law governing the licensing of intermediate care
3344 facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities, or ICF/IIDs, to establish specific
3355 licensing requirements in statute. Under current law, there are no licensing standards for
3366 these facilities, only authority for the Department of Health and Human Services to adopt
3377 rules governing licensing standards. The bill both codifies existing department rules
Page 5 - 132LR0260(01)
318 governing the licensing of ICF/IIDs and updates these licensing standards to align with
329 similar licensing laws. The bill updates related statutory language and a headnote.
3 The bill also amends the provision of law governing the reporting of sentinel events at
4 health care facilities by removing ICF/IIDs from the list of health care facilities that are
5 required to make reports to the department under this provision.

24 Sec. 5. 22 MRSA §8752, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2011, c. 542, Pt. A, §48, is
25 further amended to read:
26 2. Health care facility. "Health care facility" or "facility" means a state institution as
27 defined under Title 34‑B, chapter 1 or a health care facility licensed by the division, except
28 that it does not include a facility licensed as a nursing facility or licensed under chapter
29 1664. "Health care facility" includes a general and specialty hospital, an ambulatory
30 surgical facility, and an end-stage renal disease facility and an intermediate care facility for
31 persons with intellectual disabilities or other developmental disabilities.
32 SUMMARY
3333 This bill updates the provision of law governing the licensing of intermediate care
3344 facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities, or ICF/IIDs, to establish specific
3355 licensing requirements in statute. Under current law, there are no licensing standards for
3366 these facilities, only authority for the Department of Health and Human Services to adopt
3377 rules governing licensing standards. The bill both codifies existing department rules
Page 5 - 132LR0260(01)

318 governing the licensing of ICF/IIDs and updates these licensing standards to align with
329 similar licensing laws. The bill updates related statutory language and a headnote.
3 The bill also amends the provision of law governing the reporting of sentinel events at
4 health care facilities by removing ICF/IIDs from the list of health care facilities that are
5 required to make reports to the department under this provision.
