1 §7757. Enforcement
2 1. Enforcement; violation. Notwithstanding section 12-A, a violation of this chapter
3 is subject to enforcement under the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act, including any of the

10 1. No less restrictive than federal law. This chapter may not be construed or applied
11 to be less restrictive than federal law for a person or entity regulated by this chapter.
12 2. No conflict with federal law and regulation or other laws of this State. This
13 chapter may not be construed or applied in any manner that conflicts with:
14 A. Applicable federal law and related regulations; or
15 B. Other laws of this State if the law is compatible with applicable federal law.'
16 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section
17 number to read consecutively.
18 SUMMARY
1199 This amendment replaces the bill and prohibits discrimination by pharmaceutical
2200 manufacturers, health insurance carriers, pharmacy benefits managers and their agents
2211 against pharmacies and health care providers that participate in the federal prescription
2222 drug discount program, known as the 340B drug discount program, solely on the basis of
2233 participation in the 340B drug discount program. The amendment clarifies that the
2244 language prohibiting discrimination does not extend to the use of preferred networks by
2255 health insurance carriers and pharmacy benefits managers. The amendment requires that
2266 pharmacies and health care providers participating in the program must contract, to the
2277 extent possible and as permitted under federal law and regulation, with pharmacies located
2288 in this State. The amendment provides that enforcement under the Maine Unfair Trade
2299 Practices Act is the exclusive enforcement mechanism and does not authorize a private
3300 cause of action for enforcement. These provisions do not apply to the MaineCare program
3311 and include language to clarify that the provisions may not be construed or applied in a
3322 way that conflicts with federal law.
33 The amendment also requires hospitals that participate in the 340B drug discount
34 program to annually report additional information to the Maine Health Data Organization
35 related to their participation in the program beginning July 1, 2026.

15 conditions on any 340B entity that differ from such terms or conditions applied to entities

1 4. Discrimination against 340B entity that interferes with patient choice.
2 Discriminate against a 340B entity in a manner that prevents or interferes with a patient's
3 choice to receive 340B drugs from the 340B entity, including the administration of the
4 drugs. For purposes of this subsection, it is considered a discriminatory practice that
5 prevents or interferes with a patient's choice to receive drugs at a 340B entity if a health
6 insurance issuer, pharmacy benefits manager or other 3rd-party payor places any additional
7 requirements, restrictions or burdens upon the 340B entity that differ from the terms and
8 conditions applied to entities that are not 340B entities that result in administrative costs or
9 fees to the 340B entity, including, but not limited to, requiring a claim for a drug dispensed
10 by a pharmacy to include any identification, billing modifier, attestation or other indication
11 that a drug is a 340B drug in order to be processed or resubmitted unless it is required by
12 the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and
13 Medicaid Services or the Department of Health and Human Services for the administration
14 of the MaineCare program;
15 5. Discrimination against 340B entity that interferes with patient choice of
16 delivery method. Include any other provision in a contract between a health insurance
17 issuer, pharmacy benefits manager or other 3rd-party payor and a 340B entity that differs
18 from the terms and conditions applied to entities that are not 340B entities that
19 discriminates against the 340B entity that participates in the 340B program or prevents or
20 interferes with a patient's choice to receive a 340B drug from a 340B entity, whether by
21 direct administration, in-person dispensing, direct delivery, mail or other form of shipment;
22 6. Restrictions or additional charges prohibited. Place a restriction or additional
23 charge on a patient who chooses to receive 340B drugs from a 340B entity if the restriction
24 or additional charge differs from the terms and conditions applied when patients choose to
25 receive drugs that are not 340B drugs from an entity that is not a 340B entity or from a
26 pharmacy that is not a 340B contract pharmacy;
27 7. Submission of data pertaining to ingredient costs or pricing of 340B drugs

29 to 340B drugs from a 340B entity to any health insurance issuer, pharmacy benefits
30 manager or other 3rd-party payor; or
31 8. Exclusion from pharmacy network prohibited. Exclude any 340B entity from the
32 health insurance issuer, pharmacy benefits manager or other 3rd-party payor network on
33 the basis that the 340B entity dispenses 340B drugs or refuse to contract with a 340B entity
34 for reasons other than those that apply equally to entities that are not 340B entities.
35 This section may not be construed to limit a health insurance issuer's ability to use
36 certain preferred pharmacies or develop networks of preferred pharmacies as long as a
37 health insurance issuer's decision is not based on an entity's status as a 340B entity.
38 §7755. MaineCare program not affected
39 This chapter does not apply to the MaineCare program as a payor when the MaineCare
40 program provides reimbursement for covered outpatient drugs as defined in 42 United
41 States Code, Section 1396r-8(k)(2).
42 §7756. Contracting under 340B program
43 As permitted under federal law and regulation, a 340B entity shall, to the extent
44 possible, contract with a 340B contract pharmacy that is located in this State.

1 §7757. Enforcement
2 1. Enforcement; violation. Notwithstanding section 12-A, a violation of this chapter
3 is subject to enforcement under the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act, including any of the
4 remedies provided for in that Act. A violation is committed each time a prohibited act
5 under this chapter occurs. An investigation of a violation by a manufacturer may include a
6 wholesaler or 3rd party that may possess evidence supporting that investigation.
7 2. Exemption from enforcement. The limited distribution of a drug required under 21
8 United States Code, Section 355-1 is not a violation of this chapter.
9 §7758. Federal preemption; statutory construction
10 1. No less restrictive than federal law. This chapter may not be construed or applied
11 to be less restrictive than federal law for a person or entity regulated by this chapter.
12 2. No conflict with federal law and regulation or other laws of this State. This
13 chapter may not be construed or applied in any manner that conflicts with:
14 A. Applicable federal law and related regulations; or
15 B. Other laws of this State if the law is compatible with applicable federal law.'
16 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section
17 number to read consecutively.
18 SUMMARY
1199 This amendment replaces the bill and prohibits discrimination by pharmaceutical
2200 manufacturers, health insurance carriers, pharmacy benefits managers and their agents
2211 against pharmacies and health care providers that participate in the federal prescription
2222 drug discount program, known as the 340B drug discount program, solely on the basis of
2233 participation in the 340B drug discount program. The amendment clarifies that the
2244 language prohibiting discrimination does not extend to the use of preferred networks by
2255 health insurance carriers and pharmacy benefits managers. The amendment requires that
2266 pharmacies and health care providers participating in the program must contract, to the
2277 extent possible and as permitted under federal law and regulation, with pharmacies located
2288 in this State. The amendment provides that enforcement under the Maine Unfair Trade
2299 Practices Act is the exclusive enforcement mechanism and does not authorize a private
3300 cause of action for enforcement. These provisions do not apply to the MaineCare program
3311 and include language to clarify that the provisions may not be construed or applied in a
3322 way that conflicts with federal law.
33 The amendment also requires hospitals that participate in the 340B drug discount
34 program to annually report additional information to the Maine Health Data Organization
35 related to their participation in the program beginning July 1, 2026.
