to some issuers for calendar year 2025 but leave a portion of the state ceiling unallocated
and do not provide sufficient allocations for certain types of private activity bonds that may
require an allocation prior to the effective date of this Act if it is not enacted on an
emergency basis; and

ceiling, the rates and terms under which these bonds may be issued may be adversely
affected, resulting in increased costs to beneficiaries or even unavailability of financing for
certain projects; and
