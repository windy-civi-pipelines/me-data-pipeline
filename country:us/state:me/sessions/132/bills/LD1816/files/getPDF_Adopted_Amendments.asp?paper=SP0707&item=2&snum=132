12 Amend the bill by inserting after the title and before the emergency preamble the
13 following:
14 'Mandate preamble. This measure requires one or more local units of government
15 to expand or modify activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures from local
16 revenues but does not provide funding for at least 90% of those expenditures. Pursuant to
17 the Constitution of Maine, Article IX, Section 21, 2/3 of all of the members elected to each
18 House have determined it necessary to enact this measure; and'
19 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the
20 emergency clause and inserting the following:
21 'Sec. 1. 24 MRSA §2986, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2025, c. 109, §3, is further
22 amended to read:
23 3. Completed kit. If the victim has not reported the alleged offense to a law
24 enforcement agency when the examination is complete, the hospital or health care
25 practitioner shall then notify the nearest law enforcement agency, which shall transport and
26 store the completed forensic examination kit for 8 20 years. The completed kit may be
27 identified only by the tracking number. If during that storage period a victim decides to
28 report the alleged offense to a law enforcement agency, the victim may contact the hospital
29 or health care practitioner to determine the tracking number. The hospital or health care
30 practitioner shall provide the victim with the tracking number on the forensic examination
31 kit and shall inform the victim which law enforcement agency is storing the kit.
32 If the victim reports the alleged offense to a law enforcement agency by the time the
33 examination is complete, the investigating agency shall retain custody of the forensic
34 examination kit.

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to S.P. 707, L.D. 1816
1 If an examination is performed under subsection 5 and the victim does not, within 60 days,
2 regain a state of consciousness adequate to decide whether or not to report the alleged
3 offense, the State may file a motion in the District Court relating to the storing or processing
4 analysis of the forensic examination kit. Upon finding good cause and after considering
5 factors, including, but not limited to, the possible benefits to public safety in processing
6 analyzing the kit and the likelihood of the victim's regaining a state of consciousness
7 adequate to decide whether or not to report the alleged offense in a reasonable time, the
8 District Court may order either that the kit be stored for additional time or that the kit be
9 transported to the Maine State Police Crime Laboratory for processing analysis in
10 accordance with the laboratory's practices and procedures, or such other disposition that
11 the court determines just. In the interests of justice or upon motion by the State, the District
12 Court may conduct hearings required under this paragraph confidentially and in camera
13 and may impound pleadings and other records related to them.
14 A law enforcement agency shall store a completed forensic examination kit involving
15 sexual assault for 20 years regardless of whether the alleged offense is reported to a law
16 enforcement agency.
