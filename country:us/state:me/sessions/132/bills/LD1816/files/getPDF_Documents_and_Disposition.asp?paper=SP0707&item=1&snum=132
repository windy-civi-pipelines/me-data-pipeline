1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the creation of a statewide sexual assault forensic examination kit tracking
4 system and an inventory of all sexual assault forensic examination kits in the possession of
5 law enforcement agencies has begun pursuant to a federal grant, which will end in June
6 2025, leaving the tracking system and inventory partially complete; and
7 Whereas, this legislation requires the establishment of a forensic examination kit
8 tracking system, allowing the work that has commenced to establish a statewide tracking
9 system to continue without interruption; and
10 Whereas, the immediate passage of this legislation is critical to strengthen the State's
11 enforcement of sexual assault laws and response to sexual assault; and
12 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
13 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
14 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
15 therefore,
16 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
17 Sec. 1. 24 MRSA §2986, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2019, c. 94, §1, is further
18 amended to read:
19 3. Completed kit. If the alleged victim has not reported the alleged offense to a law
20 enforcement agency when the examination is complete, the hospital or health care
21 practitioner shall then notify the nearest law enforcement agency, which shall transport and
22 store the completed forensic examination kit for 8 20 years. The completed kit may be
23 identified only by the tracking number. If during that storage period an alleged victim
24 decides to report the alleged offense to a law enforcement agency, the alleged victim may
25 contact the hospital or health care practitioner to determine the tracking number. The
26 hospital or health care practitioner shall provide the alleged victim with the tracking
27 number on the forensic examination kit and shall inform the alleged victim which law
28 enforcement agency is storing the kit.
29 If the alleged victim reports the alleged offense to a law enforcement agency by the time
30 the examination is complete, the investigating agency shall retain custody of the forensic
31 examination kit.
32 If an examination is performed under subsection 5 and the alleged victim does not, within
33 60 days, regain a state of consciousness adequate to decide whether or not to report the
34 alleged offense, the State may file a motion in the District Court relating to the storing or
35 processing analysis of the forensic examination kit. Upon finding good cause and after
36 considering factors, including, but not limited to, the possible benefits to public safety in
37 processing analyzing the kit and the likelihood of the alleged victim's regaining a state of
38 consciousness adequate to decide whether or not to report the alleged offense in a
39 reasonable time, the District Court may order either that the kit be stored for additional time
40 or that the kit be transported to the Maine State Police Crime Laboratory for processing
41 analysis in accordance with the laboratory's practices and procedures, or such other
42 disposition that the court determines just. In the interests of justice or upon motion by the
Page 1 - 132LR1224(01)

413 State, the District Court may conduct hearings required under this paragraph confidentially
424 and in camera and may impound pleadings and other records related to them.
3 A law enforcement agency shall store a completed forensic examination kit involving
4 sexual assault for 20 years regardless of whether the alleged offense is reported to a law
5 enforcement agency.

1144 is required to submit a report by January 1, 2027, and annually thereafter, to the joint
1155 standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over criminal justice and public
1166 safety matters and the Governor concerning information related to the status of sexual

1188 requirements for the tracking system and requires the department to adopt routine technical
1199 rules, including rules regarding participation in the tracking system, confidentiality and the
2200 operation of the tracking system.
21 The bill directs that, by June 1, 2026, a law enforcement agency that receives,
22 maintains, stores or preserves sexual assault forensic examination kits must complete an
23 inventory of all kits in its possession and report its findings to the Department of Public
24 Safety. The department must compile all agency reports and present findings of the
25 inventory by January 1, 2027 to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having
26 jurisdiction over criminal justice and public safety matters and at the same time post the
27 report on the department's publicly accessible website.
