4 this resolve, the sale must be made to the highest bidder subject to the following provisions.
5 1. In accordance with the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 36, section 943-C, at least 90
6 days prior to listing property for sale, the State Tax Assessor shall send a written notice to
7 the last known address of the former owner by United States Postal Service certified mail,
8 return receipt requested, and first-class mail of the sale process under Title 36, section
9 943-C, subsection 3.
10 2. After 90 days, the State Tax Assessor shall list and sell the property with a real
11 estate broker or agent licensed under Title 32, chapter 114 using the sale process described
12 in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 36, section 943-C, subsection 3.
13 3. If, after 3 attempts, the State Tax Assessor is unable to contract with a real estate
14 broker or agent for the sale of the property, or the broker or agent is unable to sell the
15 property within 12 months after listing, the State Tax Assessor shall sell the property to the
