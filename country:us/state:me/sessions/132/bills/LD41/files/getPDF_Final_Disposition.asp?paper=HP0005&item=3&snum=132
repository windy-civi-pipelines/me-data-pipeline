this resolve, the sale must be made to the highest bidder subject to the following provisions.
1. In accordance with the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 36, section 943-C, at least 90
days prior to listing property for sale, the State Tax Assessor shall send a written notice to
the last known address of the former owner by United States Postal Service certified mail,
return receipt requested, and first-class mail of the sale process under Title 36, section
943-C, subsection 3.
2. After 90 days, the State Tax Assessor shall list and sell the property with a real
estate broker or agent licensed under Title 32, chapter 114 using the sale process described
in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 36, section 943-C, subsection 3.
3. If, after 3 attempts, the State Tax Assessor is unable to contract with a real estate
broker or agent for the sale of the property, or the broker or agent is unable to sell the
property within 12 months after listing, the State Tax Assessor shall sell the property to the
highest bidder for an amount not less than the outstanding taxes, interest, deed and other
costs. Notice of the sale must be published 3 times prior to the sale, once each week for 3
consecutive weeks in a newspaper in the county where the real estate lies, except in those
cases in which the sale is to be made to a specific individual or individuals as authorized in
this resolve, in which case notice need not be published.
4. Following the sale of any property under this resolve, the State Tax Assessor shall
pay the former owner any excess sale proceeds in accordance with the Maine Revised
Statutes, Title 36, section 943-C, subsection 3.
If bids in the minimum amount recommended in this resolve are not received after the
notice of sale under subsection 3, the State Tax Assessor may sell the property for not less
than the minimum amount without again asking for bids if the property is sold on or before
August 1, 2026.
