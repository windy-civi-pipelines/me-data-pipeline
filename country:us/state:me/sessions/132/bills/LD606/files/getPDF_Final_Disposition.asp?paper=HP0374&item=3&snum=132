become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, farmers and food producers are facing increasing challenges when trying
to access both state and federal grant programs; and
Whereas, this legislation needs to take effect before the expiration of the 90-day
period to allow the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, Bureau of
Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources to study the bureau's financial assistance programs
to identify barriers to and improve effectiveness of these programs as soon as possible; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within

stakeholder input on lowering barriers to financial assistance programs.
Resolved: That the Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry shall direct
