16 ยง580-I. Climate Superfund Cost Recovery Program
17 The Climate Superfund Cost Recovery Program is established within and administered
18 by the department. The purposes of the program are:
19 1. Compensatory payments. To secure compensatory payments from responsible
20 parties based on a standard of strict liability to provide a source of revenue for climate
21 change adaptation projects within the State;
22 2. Proportional liabilities. To determine proportional liability of responsible parties;
23 3. Cost recovery demands. To impose cost recovery demands on responsible parties
24 and issue notices of cost recovery demands;
25 4. Responsible party payments. To accept and collect payment from responsible
26 parties;
27 5. Strategy. To develop, adopt, implement and update the strategy in order to identify
28 and prioritize climate change adaptation projects; and
29 6. Funds dispersal. To disperse funds to climate change adaptation projects identified
30 in the strategy.
31 ยง580-J. Liability of responsible parties
32 1. Responsible party liability. A responsible party is strictly liable for a share of the
33 costs of climate change adaptation projects and all qualifying expenditures from the fund.
34 For purposes of this section, entities in a controlled group:
35 A. Must be treated by the department as a single entity for the purposes of identifying
36 responsible parties; and
37 B. Are jointly and severally liable for payment of any cost recovery demand owed by
38 any entity in the controlled group.
39 2. Cost recovery demand. With respect to each responsible party, the cost recovery
40 demand is equal to an amount that bears the same ratio to the cost to the State and its
41 residents, as calculated by the Treasurer of State, from the emission of covered greenhouse
Page 3 - 132LR0022(01)

412 gases during the covered period as the responsible party's applicable share of covered
423 greenhouse gas emissions bears to the aggregate applicable shares of covered greenhouse
434 gas emissions resulting from the use of fossil fuels extracted or refined during the covered
445 period.
5 3. Minority interest. If a responsible party owns a minority interest of 10% or more
6 in another entity, the responsible party's applicable share of covered greenhouse gas
7 emissions is increased by the applicable share of covered greenhouse gas emissions for the
8 entity in which the responsible party holds a minority interest multiplied by the percentage
9 of the minority interest held by the responsible party.
10 4. Greenhouse gas emissions. The department shall use the United States
11 Environmental Protection Agency's emissions factors for greenhouse gas inventories as
12 applied to the fossil fuel volume data for the purpose of determining the amount of covered
13 greenhouse gas emissions attributable to any entity from the fossil fuels attributable to the
14 entity.
15 5. Adjustments. The department may adjust the cost recovery demand amount of a
16 responsible party who refined petroleum products or who is a successor in interest to an
17 entity that refines petroleum products if the responsible party establishes to the satisfaction
18 of the department that:
19 A. A portion of the cost recovery demand amount was attributable to the refining of
20 crude oil extracted by another responsible party; and
21 B. The crude oil extracted by the other entity was accounted for when the department
22 determined the cost recovery demand amount for the other entity or a successor in
23 interest or the other entity.
24 6. Payments; installments. A responsible party shall pay the cost recovery demand
25 amount in full not later than 6 months following the department's issuance of the cost
26 recovery demand, except that a responsible party may elect to pay the cost recovery demand
27 amount in 9 annual installments in accordance with this subsection.
28 The first installment must be paid not later than 6 months following the department's
29 issuance of the cost recovery demand and is equal to 20% of the total cost recovery demand
30 amount. Each subsequent installment must be paid not later than one year from the initial
31 payment and each subsequent year and must be equal to 10% of the total cost recovery
32 demand amount. The commissioner may charge reasonable interest on each installment
33 payment or a delayed payment and, at the commissioner's discretion, may adjust the amount
34 of a subsequent installment payment or a delayed payment to reflect increases or decreases
35 in the Consumer Price Index. The unpaid balance of all remaining installments becomes
36 due immediately if:
37 A. The responsible party fails to pay any installment in a timely manner, as specified
38 in department rules;
39 B. There is a liquidation or sale of substantially all the assets of the responsible party,
40 except that, in the case of a sale of substantially all the assets of a responsible party,
41 the remaining installments do not become due immediately if the buyer enters into an
42 agreement with the department under which the buyer assumes liability for the
43 remaining installments due under this subsection in the same manner as if the buyer
44 were the responsible party; or
Page 4 - 132LR0022(01)

1 C. The responsible party ceases to do business.
2 7. Fund deposits. The department shall deposit cost recovery payments collected
3 under this chapter into the fund.
4 8. Reconsideration. A responsible party aggrieved by the issuance of a notice of cost
5 recovery demand may file a request for reconsideration with the department within 30 days
6 following issuance of the notice of cost recovery demand. A request for reconsideration
7 must state the grounds for the request and include supporting documentation. The
8 department shall notify the responsible party of the final decision by issuing a subsequent
9 notice of cost recovery demand. A responsible party aggrieved by the issuance of a final
10 notice of cost recovery demand under this subsection may bring an action in the Superior
11 Court of Kennebec County seeking an order annulling, altering or modifying the notice of
12 cost recovery demand.
13 ยง580-K. Climate Superfund Cost Recovery Program Fund
14 1. Fund established. The Climate Superfund Cost Recovery Program Fund is
15 established and is administered by the commissioner to provide funding for climate change
16 adaptation projects in the State. The fund consists of:
17 A. Cost recovery payments deposited into the fund under section 580-J;
18 B. Funds from time to time appropriated to the fund by the Legislature; and
19 C. Gifts, donations or other funds received from any source, public or private,

28 SUMMARY
2299 This bill establishes the Climate Superfund Cost Recovery Program within the
3300 Department of Environmental Protection. Under the program, an entity or a successor in
3311 interest to an entity that was engaged in the trade or business of extracting fossil fuel or
3322 refining crude oil between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2024 is assessed a cost
3333 recovery demand for the entity's share of fossil fuel extraction or refinement contributing
3344 to greenhouse gas-related costs in the State. An entity is assessed a cost recovery demand
3355 only if the department determines that the entity's products were responsible for more than
3366 one billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. Cost recovery payments received by
3377 the department are deposited into the Climate Superfund Cost Recovery Program Fund to
3388 provide funding for climate change adaptation projects in the State, which the department
3399 is directed to prioritize through the adoption of a resilience implementation strategy.
