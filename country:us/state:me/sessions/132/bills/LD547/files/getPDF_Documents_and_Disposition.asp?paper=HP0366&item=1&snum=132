12 component, that does not compromise the integrity of the frame or any mechanical
13 component of the motor vehicle necessary for safe operation. "Exterior, nonstructural

15 rocker panel or pickup bed. "Exterior, nonstructural corrosion" does not include corrosion
16 that affects the interior of the motor vehicle's passenger compartment. The Chief of the

19 SUMMARY
2200 This bill provides that a motor vehicle may not be rejected for violation of any
2211 inspection standard for exterior, nonstructural corrosion. It defines "exterior, nonstructural
2222 corrosion" to be corrosion of a body component, including corrosion that has resulted in a
2233 hole or aperture in the body component, that does not compromise the integrity of the frame
2244 or any mechanical component of the motor vehicle necessary for safe operation. The bill
2255 specifies that "exterior, nonstructural corrosion" includes but is not limited to corrosion of
2266 a hood, trunk, hatch, door, fender, rocker panel or pickup bed but does not include corrosion
2277 that affects the interior of the motor vehicle's passenger compartment. The bill allows the
2288 Chief of the State Police to adopt rules to facilitate the application and administration of
2299 this provision.
