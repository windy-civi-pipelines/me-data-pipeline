28 SUMMARY
2299 The bill eliminates the existing law that requires the Department of Health and Human
3300 Services to adopt guidelines governing charity care and replaces it with a more
3311 comprehensive law governing charity care and other financial assistance programs
3322 provided by hospitals to patients to cover charges for services provided by that hospital.
3333 The bill does the following.
34 1. It requires that hospitals provide charity care or free health care services to patients
35 who are state residents and whose family income is equal to or less than 200% of the federal
36 poverty level.
37 2. It establishes requirements with respect to hospital-provided financial assistance
38 programs and specific requirements applying only to charity care that hospitals must follow
39 in accordance with rules adopted by the department concerning the application process,
40 language interpretation, eligibility determinations, notification of eligibility determinations
41 and, in the case of charity care, rights to a hearing following a denial.
42 3. It requires that hospitals widely publicize their financial assistance programs within
43 the community served by the hospital, including by publishing a summary of the programs
Page 7 - 132LR0979(01)
414 written in plain language; by providing physical copies of the summary, application and
425 application instructions in conspicuous locations within the hospital; and by posting a full,
436 accessible and downloadable version of the application on the hospital's publicly accessible
447 website.
5 4. It requires that a hospital provide individual written notice of the availability of
6 charity care to each patient. For inpatient services, the notice must be provided upon
7 admission, or in the case of emergency admission before discharge. For outpatient services,
8 individual notice must be included with the patient's bill or at the time service is provided.
9 5. It requires that a hospital notify a patient who is determined to be eligible for
10 financial assistance if any part of the services provided are not covered by the hospital's
11 financial assistance program. A hospital that fails to provide this notice is prohibited from
12 charging the patient for those services, but is permitted to charge the patient's health
13 insurance carrier for those services.
14 6. It provides that a hospital must offer, for patients with family incomes that do not
15 exceed 400% of the federal poverty level, a payment plan that requires monthly out-of-
16 pocket payments that do not exceed 3% of the patient's monthly family income that is not
17 exempt from attachment or garnishment under Maine law.
18 7. It requires hospitals to include on a patient's bill information concerning the process
19 for disputing charges.
20 8. It requires that hospitals provide an online option for applying for charity care.
21 9. It requires the department to enforce the provisions of this bill. The department must
22 establish a process to receive patient complaints for hospital noncompliance, conduct
23 reviews of those complaints and require a corrective action when a hospital is found to be
24 noncompliant.
25 10. It establishes a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000 for hospitals that knowingly or
26 willfully violate the provisions of this bill or engage in a pattern of noncompliance with
27 these provisions.
28 11. It requires the department to adopt rules by June 30, 2026 to carry out the purposes
29 of this bill.

28 SUMMARY
2299 The bill eliminates the existing law that requires the Department of Health and Human
3300 Services to adopt guidelines governing charity care and replaces it with a more
3311 comprehensive law governing charity care and other financial assistance programs
3322 provided by hospitals to patients to cover charges for services provided by that hospital.
3333 The bill does the following.
34 1. It requires that hospitals provide charity care or free health care services to patients
35 who are state residents and whose family income is equal to or less than 200% of the federal
36 poverty level.
37 2. It establishes requirements with respect to hospital-provided financial assistance
38 programs and specific requirements applying only to charity care that hospitals must follow
39 in accordance with rules adopted by the department concerning the application process,
40 language interpretation, eligibility determinations, notification of eligibility determinations
41 and, in the case of charity care, rights to a hearing following a denial.
42 3. It requires that hospitals widely publicize their financial assistance programs within
43 the community served by the hospital, including by publishing a summary of the programs
Page 7 - 132LR0979(01)

414 written in plain language; by providing physical copies of the summary, application and
425 application instructions in conspicuous locations within the hospital; and by posting a full,
436 accessible and downloadable version of the application on the hospital's publicly accessible
447 website.
5 4. It requires that a hospital provide individual written notice of the availability of
6 charity care to each patient. For inpatient services, the notice must be provided upon
7 admission, or in the case of emergency admission before discharge. For outpatient services,
8 individual notice must be included with the patient's bill or at the time service is provided.
9 5. It requires that a hospital notify a patient who is determined to be eligible for
10 financial assistance if any part of the services provided are not covered by the hospital's
11 financial assistance program. A hospital that fails to provide this notice is prohibited from
12 charging the patient for those services, but is permitted to charge the patient's health
13 insurance carrier for those services.
14 6. It provides that a hospital must offer, for patients with family incomes that do not
15 exceed 400% of the federal poverty level, a payment plan that requires monthly out-of-
16 pocket payments that do not exceed 3% of the patient's monthly family income that is not
17 exempt from attachment or garnishment under Maine law.
18 7. It requires hospitals to include on a patient's bill information concerning the process
19 for disputing charges.
20 8. It requires that hospitals provide an online option for applying for charity care.
21 9. It requires the department to enforce the provisions of this bill. The department must
22 establish a process to receive patient complaints for hospital noncompliance, conduct
23 reviews of those complaints and require a corrective action when a hospital is found to be
24 noncompliant.
25 10. It establishes a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000 for hospitals that knowingly or
26 willfully violate the provisions of this bill or engage in a pattern of noncompliance with
27 these provisions.
28 11. It requires the department to adopt rules by June 30, 2026 to carry out the purposes
29 of this bill.
