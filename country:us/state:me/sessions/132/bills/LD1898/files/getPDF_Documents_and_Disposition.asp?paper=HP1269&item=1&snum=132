28 SUMMARY
2299 This bill modifies provisions of the Maine Human Rights Act to correct references to
3300 protection orders that were sought or received under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title
3311 19-A, former section 4007, which was repealed effective January 1, 2023. The bill clarifies
3322 that it remains unlawful to discriminate against an individual on the basis of that
3333 individual's previous actions seeking or receiving an order of protection under the former
3344 law and that it is unlawful to discriminate against an individual on the basis of that
3355 individual's previous actions seeking or receiving a final protection order under the current
3366 law or under a substantially similar provision of the law of another state or nation.

28 SUMMARY
2299 This bill modifies provisions of the Maine Human Rights Act to correct references to
3300 protection orders that were sought or received under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title
3311 19-A, former section 4007, which was repealed effective January 1, 2023. The bill clarifies
3322 that it remains unlawful to discriminate against an individual on the basis of that
3333 individual's previous actions seeking or receiving an order of protection under the former
3344 law and that it is unlawful to discriminate against an individual on the basis of that
3355 individual's previous actions seeking or receiving a final protection order under the current
3366 law or under a substantially similar provision of the law of another state or nation.
