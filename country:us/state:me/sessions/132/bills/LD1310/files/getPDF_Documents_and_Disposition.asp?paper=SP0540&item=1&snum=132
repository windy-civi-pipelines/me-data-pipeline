4 3-A. Parity in cost sharing for primary care and behavioral health office visits;

16 Service determines that the benefits required by this section are permissible benefits in a
17 high deductible health plan as defined in the federal Internal Revenue Code, Section
18 223(c)(2) or to a health plan that has no deductible, no coinsurance and out-of-pocket limits
19 that meet the applicable federal requirements. The superintendent may adopt rules as
20 necessary to address the coordination of the requirements of this subsection for coverage
21 without cost sharing for the first primary care visit and the requirements of this section with

23 routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.
24 Sec. 2. 24-A MRSA §4320-A, sub-§3-B, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 638, §3, is

27 group health plan. A group health plan, other than a small group health plan subject to
28 subsection 3‑A, with an effective date on or after January 1, 2023 must provide coverage
29 without cost sharing for the first primary care office visit and first behavioral health office
30 visit in each plan year. After the first behavioral health office visit, a health plan may not
31 apply a copayment amount to a behavioral health office visit that is greater than the
32 copayment for a primary care office visit. For the purposes of this subsection, “behavioral
33 health office visit” means an office visit to address mental health and substance use
34 conditions. This subsection does not apply to a plan offered for use with a health savings
35 account unless the federal Internal Revenue Service determines that the benefits required
36 by this section are permissible benefits in a high deductible health plan as defined in the
37 federal Internal Revenue Code, Section 223(c)(2) or to a health plan that has no deductible,
38 no coinsurance and out-of-pocket limits that meet the applicable federal requirements. The
