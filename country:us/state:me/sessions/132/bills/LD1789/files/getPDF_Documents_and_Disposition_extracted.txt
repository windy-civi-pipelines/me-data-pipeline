38 board's own licensure requirements.

20 basis of substantial equivalency practice privilege reciprocity pursuant to section 12232
21 12232-A and complying with the restrictions on the scope of such a practice is
22 equivalent to an individual licensed as a certified public accountant under section
23 12230 or 12231 12231-B or a corresponding provision of prior law, and each reference
24 in this section to a licensed certified public accountant is deemed to include, on an
25 equal basis, such an individual;
26 B. A firm in compliance with section 12252, subsection 1 must, for the purposes of
27 this section, be deemed to hold a valid license issued under section 12252; and
28 C. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, it is not a violation of this
29 section for a firm that does not hold a valid license under section 12252 and that does
30 not maintain an office in this State to use the title "CPA" or "Certified Public
31 Accountants" as part of the firm's name and to provide professional services in this
32 State, and licensees and individuals with practice privileges may provide services on
33 behalf of such a firm if the firm complies with the requirements of section 12252,
34 subsection 1, paragraph A, subparagraph (3) or section 12252, subsection 1, paragraph
35 B or C, whichever is applicable. An individual or firm authorized under this paragraph
36 to use practice privileges in this State shall comply with the requirements otherwise
37 applicable to licensees under this section.

20 basis of substantial equivalency practice privilege reciprocity pursuant to section 12232
21 12232-A and complying with the restrictions on the scope of such a practice is
22 equivalent to an individual licensed as a certified public accountant under section
23 12230 or 12231 12231-B or a corresponding provision of prior law, and each reference
24 in this section to a licensed certified public accountant is deemed to include, on an
25 equal basis, such an individual;

27 this section, be deemed to hold a valid license issued under section 12252; and

29 section for a firm that does not hold a valid license under section 12252 and that does
30 not maintain an office in this State to use the title "CPA" or "Certified Public
31 Accountants" as part of the firm's name and to provide professional services in this
32 State, and licensees and individuals with practice privileges may provide services on
33 behalf of such a firm if the firm complies with the requirements of section 12252,
34 subsection 1, paragraph A, subparagraph (3) or section 12252, subsection 1, paragraph
35 B or C, whichever is applicable. An individual or firm authorized under this paragraph
