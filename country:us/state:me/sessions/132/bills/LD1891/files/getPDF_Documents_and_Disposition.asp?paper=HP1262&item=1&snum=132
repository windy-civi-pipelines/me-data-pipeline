7 §12307. Dentists for Maine's Future Scholarship Program
8 There is established the Dentists for Maine's Future Scholarship Program, referred to
9 in this section as "the scholarship program," to provide a tuition subsidy of 50% of the cost
10 of attendance, up to a maximum of $25,000 per student annually, for eligible students who
11 enter dental school programs in this State for the purpose of increasing the number of
12 dentists in this State who practice in extreme shortage areas. For the purposes of this
13 section, "cost of attendance" means the tuition and fees applicable to an eligible student,
14 together with estimated other expenses reasonably related to the cost of attendance at a
15 dental school program in this State.
16 1. Definition; eligible student. For purposes of this section, "eligible student" means
17 a student who meets eligibility requirements set by the authority by rule that include at least
18 the following:
19 A. That the student is or will be enrolled in a dental school program in this State; and
20 B. That the student has a substantial connection to the State as evidenced by factors
21 such as prior education in this State, a parent residing in this State and at least one year
22 of residence in this State for purposes other than education.
23 2. Priority. In awarding scholarships under the scholarship program, the authority
24 shall give priority to an eligible student who meets at least 2 of the following provisions:
25 A. The student has received a high school diploma, or its equivalent, in this State;
26 B. The student has received a bachelor's degree from a 4-year college or university in

32 program has raised matching funds pursuant to subsection 4 as of the January 1st
33 immediately preceding the scholarship award.
34 4. Matching funds. Beginning January 1, 2026, if a dental school program in this
35 State raises matching funds in an amount less than the amount of scholarship funds
36 allocable to it under this section from the State for a given year or does not have a sufficient
37 number of eligible students who apply to fill the number of scholarships allocable to it, the
38 number of scholarships allocated to that program must be reduced accordingly and
39 scholarships must be reallocated for that year to eligible students of other dental school
40 programs in this State. A dental school program in this State must use funds raised through
41 philanthropic and private dental education fundraising to increase the number of

9 earning, revolving fund under the jurisdiction of the authority, known as the Dentists for
10 Maine's Future Scholarship Fund, is created to carry out the purposes of this section. Any
11 unexpended balance in the fund carries over for continued use under this section. The
12 authority may receive, invest and expend on behalf of the fund money from gifts, grants,
13 bequests and donations or other sources in addition to money appropriated or allocated by
14 the State. Money in the fund must be invested by the authority, as provided by law, with
