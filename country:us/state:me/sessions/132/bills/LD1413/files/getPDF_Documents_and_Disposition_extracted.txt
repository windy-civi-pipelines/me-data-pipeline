28 B. Is seeking to replace a recently lost, stolen, broken or failing hearing aid with a
29 hearing aid of the same specifications; and

32 SUMMARY
3333 This bill changes provisions of law governing insurance coverage for hearing aids and
3344 hearing aid dealing and fitting practices to allow an exception to a requirement that an
3355 individual attend an ear or hearing examination prior to obtaining a replacement hearing
3366 aid if that individual is too ill or infirm to safely attend the examination.
