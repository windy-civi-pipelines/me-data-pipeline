12 Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following:
13 'An Act to Amend Laws Governing Hearing Aid Dealers to Allow an Exception to
14 Certain Hearing Examination Requirements'
15 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and inserting the
16 following:
17 'Sec. 1. 32 MRSA §17305, sub-§6, ¶K, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 369, Pt. C, §3
18 and affected by §5, is amended to read:
19 K. A Except as authorized in this paragraph, a dealer-licensee may not sell or furnish
20 a hearing aid to a person 18 years of age or younger without a written statement, signed
21 by a physician with specialized training in the field of otolaryngology, that the person
22 has had an ear or hearing examination within 90 days of the purchase or furnishing of
23 the hearing aid and that a hearing aid is recommended for the person. The board shall
24 adopt rules for the requirements for reexamination. Rules adopted pursuant to this
25 paragraph are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.
26 The board shall by rule list and define certain medical conditions affecting hearing. If
27 a dealer has notice of the existence of one or more of the conditions in the case of a
28 prospective purchaser of a hearing aid, whether by the dealer-licensee’s observation of
29 the prospective purchaser or by information furnished by the prospective purchaser,
30 fitting of the hearing aid must be delayed until the purchaser has had an ear or hearing
31 examination administered by a physician with specialized training in the field of
32 otolaryngology or by an audiologist who, as a result of such an examination,
33 recommends in writing a hearing aid for the prospective purchaser. Unless prohibited
34 by federal law or regulation, a dealer-licensee may sell or furnish a replacement hearing
35 aid of the same specifications as the original hearing aid to a prospective purchaser of
36 any age without evidence that the prospective purchaser has had a recent ear or hearing

317 examination if the prospective purchaser typically wears or is currently using a hearing
328 aid; is seeking to replace a recently lost, stolen, broken or failing hearing aid; and is
339 unable to attend a hearing examination because the prospective purchaser is too ill or
440 infirm to do so safely.
5 Nothing in this This chapter may not be construed to require an ear or hearing
6 examination by a physician or audiologist of a person who objects to the examination
7 on the grounds that the examination conflicts with the tenets and practices of a church
8 or religious denomination of which the person is a member or adherent.'
9 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section
10 number to read consecutively.
11 SUMMARY
