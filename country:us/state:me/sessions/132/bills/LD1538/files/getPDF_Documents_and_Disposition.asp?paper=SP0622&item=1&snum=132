24 The Special Administrative Expense Fund is created as a special fund in the State

26 contributions tendered as a contribution to this fund must be paid into this fund. The money
27 may not be expended or available for expenditure in any manner that would permit its
28 substitution for, or a corresponding reduction in, federal funds that would in the absence of
29 that money be available to finance expenditures for the administration of the Employment
30 Security Law Reemployment Assistance Program. Nothing in this This section prevents
31 does not prevent the money from being used as a revolving fund to cover expenditures,
32 necessary and proper under the law, for which federal funds have been duly requested but
33 not yet received, subject to the charging of those expenditures against those funds when
34 received. The money in this fund must be used by the commissioner either for the payment
35 of costs of administration that are found not to have been properly and validly chargeable
36 against federal grants or other funds received for or in the Employment Security
37 Administration Fund on or after January 1, 1943, to finance the Maine Wage Assurance
38 Fund established in section 632; for the payment of costs of administering chapter 26, for
39 which federal funds are not available; or to fund activities that will improve the solvency
40 of the Unemployment Compensation Fund. The money must be available either to satisfy
41 the obligations incurred by the bureau directly or by requesting the Treasurer of State to
42 transfer the required amount from the Special Administrative Expense Fund to the
Page 1 - 132LR1638(01)

413 Employment Security Administration Fund or the Maine Wage Assurance Fund. The
424 Treasurer of State shall upon receipt of a written request of the commissioner make any
435 such transfer. The commissioner shall give notice to the commission prior to any
446 expenditures from this fund. The commissioner shall order the transfer of the funds or the
457 payment of any such obligation and the funds must be paid by the Treasurer of State on
468 requisitions drawn by the commissioner directing the State Controller to issue the State
479 Controller's warrant for them. The warrant must be drawn by the State Controller based
580 upon bills of particulars and vouchers certified by an officer or employee designated by the
591 commissioner. The money in this fund is specifically made available to replace, within a
1502 reasonable time, any money received by this State pursuant to section Section 302 of the
1513 Federal federal Social Security Act as amended that, because of any action or contingency,
1524 has been lost or has been expended for purposes other than, or in amounts in excess of,
1535 those necessary for the proper administration of the Employment Security Law
1546 Reemployment Assistance Program. The money in this fund must be continuously
1557 available to the commissioner for expenditure in accordance with this section and may not
1568 lapse at any time or be transferred to any other fund except as provided. Any money in the
1579 Special Administrative Expense Fund may be used to make refunds of interest, penalties
1680 or fines erroneously collected and deposited in the Special Administrative Expense Fund.

2602 to the Unemployment Compensation Fund.
