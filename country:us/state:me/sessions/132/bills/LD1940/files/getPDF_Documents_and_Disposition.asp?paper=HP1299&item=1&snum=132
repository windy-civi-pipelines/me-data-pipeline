30 In order to comply with the requirement in section 4326 4326-A for each municipality
31 to adopt land use policies and land use ordinances to discourage incompatible development,
32 a municipality may adopt a transfer of development rights program for the transfer of
33 development rights within its boundaries. Two or more municipalities may adopt a
34 program that provides for the transfer of development rights between the municipalities if
35 the municipalities have entered into an interlocal agreement pursuant to chapter 115 for
36 this purpose.
37 Sec. 15. 30-A MRSA §4346, 2nd ¶, as amended by PL 2021, c. 590, Pt. A, §10, is
38 further amended to read:
39 The department may enter into financial assistance grants only to the extent that funds
40 are available. In making grants, the department shall consider the need for planning in a
41 municipality or multimunicipal region, the proximity of the municipality or multimunicipal
Page 12 - 132LR0289(01)

412 region to other areas that are conducting or have completed the planning process and the
423 economic and geographic role of the municipality or multimunicipal region within a
434 regional context. The department shall give priority in making grants to any municipality
445 or multimunicipal region that has adopted a local climate action plan and, if the
456 municipality or multimunicipal region has adopted a comprehensive plan or growth
467 management program, prepared a climate vulnerability assessment pursuant to section
478 4326, subsection 1, paragraph L. The department may consider other criteria in making
489 grants, as long as the criteria support the goal of encouraging and facilitating the adoption
590 and implementation of local and multimunicipal growth management programs consistent
1501 with the procedures, goals, requirements and guidelines established in this subchapter. In
1512 order to maximize the availability of the technical and financial assistance program to all
1523 municipalities, multimunicipal regions and regional councils, financial assistance programs
1534 administered competitively under this article are exempt from rules adopted by the
1545 Department of Administrative and Financial Services pursuant to Title 5, section 1825‑C
1556 for use in the purchase of services and the awarding of grants and contracts. The
1567 department shall publish a program statement describing its grant program and advertising
1578 its availability to eligible applicants.
18 Sec. 16. 30-A MRSA §4346, sub-§5, as amended by PL 2013, c. 300, §6, is further

27 development. Certification does not lapse in any year in which the Legislature does not
28 appropriate funds to the department for the purposes of reviewing programs for
29 recertification.
30 C. Upon a request for review under this section, the department may review rate of
31 growth, impact fee and zoning ordinances to determine whether the ordinances are
32 consistent with a comprehensive plan that has been found consistent under this section
33 without requiring submission of all elements of a growth management program. An
34 affirmative finding of consistency by the department is required for a municipality or
35 multimunicipal region to assert jurisdiction as provided in section 4349‑A.
36 Sec. 19. 30-A MRSA §4347-A, sub-§3, ¶C, as amended by PL 2011, c. 655, Pt.

9 requests a certificate of consistency for its growth management program, any
10 unmodified component of that program that has previously been reviewed by the
11 former State Planning Office or the department and has received a finding of
12 consistency will retain that finding during program certification review by the
13 department as long as the finding of consistency is current as defined in rules
14 adopted by the department;
15 Sec. 20. 30-A MRSA §4347-A, sub-§3-A, as amended by PL 2011, c. 655, Pt. JJ,

33 inconsistent based on a review of the requirements of this subchapter;
34 D. Within 10 business days of issuing notification that a comprehensive plan is
35 complete for purposes of review, issue findings specifically describing whether the
36 submitted plan is consistent with the procedures, goals and guidelines established in
37 this subchapter and identify which inconsistencies in the plan, if any, may directly
38 affect rate of growth, zoning or impact fee ordinances.
39 (1) In its findings, the department shall clearly indicate its position on any point
40 on which there are significant conflicts among the written comments submitted to
41 the department.
42 (2) If the department finds that the comprehensive plan was developed in
43 accordance with the procedures, goals and guidelines established in this
Page 15 - 132LR0289(01)

414 subchapter, the department shall issue a finding of consistency for the
425 comprehensive plan.

19 of the date of the finding without addressing any new review standards that are created
20 during that time interval. After 24 months, the plan must be resubmitted in its entirety
21 for state review under the department's most current review standards.
22 If the department finds that a plan is not consistent with the procedures, goals and
23 guidelines requirements established in this subchapter, and in the rules and guidance
24 adopted and established by the department, the municipality or multimunicipal district
25 region that submitted the plan may appeal that finding to the department within 20 business
26 days of receipt of the finding in accordance with rules adopted by the department, which
27 are routine technical rules pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.
28 The department's decision on consistency of a comprehensive plan constitutes final agency
29 action.

41 6. Effect on State. A zoning ordinance that is not consistent with a comprehensive
42 plan that is consistent with the provisions of section 4326 4326-A is advisory with respect
43 to the State. Except as provided in this section, a state agency shall comply with a zoning
44 ordinance consistent with a comprehensive plan that is consistent with the provisions of
Page 16 - 132LR0289(01)

415 section 4326 4326-A in seeking to develop any building, parking facility or other publicly
426 owned structure. The Governor or the Governor's designee may, after public notice and
437 opportunity for public comment, including written notice to the municipal officers, waive
448 any use restrictions in those ordinances upon finding that:
5 A. The proposed use is not allowed anywhere in the municipality;
6 B. There are no reasonable alternative sites for or configurations of the project within

16 JJ, §27 and affected by §41 and amended by c. 657, Pt. W, §5, is further amended by
17 amending subparagraph (2), division (a) to read:
18 (a) Has adopted a comprehensive plan that is determined by the Executive
19 Department, former State Planning Office or the Department of Agriculture,
20 Conservation and Forestry the Maine Office of Community Affairs,
21 established in Title 5, section 3202, to be consistent with section 4326,
22 subsections 1 to 4 4326-A.
23 Sec. 23. 30-A MRSA §5953-D, sub-§4-A, as amended by PL 2003, c. 288, §3, is
24 further amended to read:
25 4-A. Criteria; conditions for downtown improvement grants or loans. The
26 Department of Economic and Community Development, in conjunction with the bank,
27 shall develop criteria and conditions for the award of downtown improvement grants or
28 loans to eligible municipalities after consultation with the state agencies listed in subsection
29 5 and subject to the requirements of this section. The department shall establish a
30 preference for municipalities that are regional service centers or urban compact
31 municipalities or have adopted a comprehensive plan consistent with section 4326 4326-A.
32 Sec. 24. Office to adopt rules. The Maine Office of Community Affairs,
33 established in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, section 3202, shall amend existing rules
34 governing the growth management program to be consistent with the laws governing the
35 program as amended by this Act. Notwithstanding Title 30-A, section 4312, subsection 4,
36 rules adopted pursuant to this section are major substantive rules as defined in Title 5,
37 chapter 375, subchapter 2-A. The following placetype descriptions must be incorporated
38 into the rules.
39 1. Adjacent neighborhood. "Adjacent neighborhood" means a primarily residential
40 area located adjacent to a village center, downtown or high-impact corridor. Adjacent
41 neighborhoods are predominantly developed for residential activities and are typically
42 arranged along a network of interconnected streets.
Page 17 - 132LR0289(01)

1 2. Adjacent rural lands. "Adjacent rural lands" means large undeveloped land areas
2 adjacent to rural backlands and to areas where there is development activity. Adjacent rural
3 lands typically include land located behind lots along rural roads or adjacent to a rural
4 center, village center or other placetype. Adjacent rural lands can also be located adjacent
5 to suburban areas. Because of their proximity to land where development is present,
6 adjacent rural lands are a high priority for local planning and policy work to verify goals
7 for future land use.
8 3. Advanced suburban area. "Advanced suburban area" means an area where low-
9 density development has spread from the road frontage deeper into lots and to adjacent
10 rural land. Development within these areas is typically segregated by use and may include
11 commercial strip malls, regional shopping centers, so-called big box retail development,
12 office parks, residential subdivisions and other forms of single-use development.
13 Advanced suburban areas result in disconnected development and fragmented open spaces
14 disconnected from a larger network of habitat corridors, trails and other natural systems.
15 4. Rural backlands. "Rural backlands" means geographically isolated areas with no
16 direct frontage onto public roads. Rural backlands often have very little or no development
17 and may be intersected by trails and utility corridors. These areas may contain conserved
18 lands, critical natural resources and important natural resources. Depending on local
19 municipal land use policies, rural backlands may be targeted for conservation, as working
20 lands, or for development that limits impacts on wildlife, water management, agricultural
21 uses and active outdoor recreation activities.
22 5. Rural center. "Rural center" means an area with a grouping of 2 or more buildings
23 that have formed a center of community within a rural area. It may include historic or
24 architecturally important or significant buildings. A rural center can vary in size but is
25 geographically smaller in size than a village center placetype.
26 6. Rural farmstead. "Rural farmstead" means a parcel of land that serves or has the
27 potential to serve as a mixed-use, resource-based economic center of activity in a rural area.
28 A rural farmstead may consist of adjacent buildings on a single parcel that support the
29 commercial, residential and economic needs of a rural agricultural or forestry business. A
30 rural farmstead allows for mixed-use development in rural areas to provide economic
31 options to rural landowners while also safeguarding the agricultural and forest sectors from
32 fragmented low-density development.
33 7. Rural road. "Rural road" means a road that has the characteristics of a rural area,
34 with homes and businesses occurring at infrequent intervals on lots that often exceed 5
35 acres in size, and are frequently much larger, with driveways that typically occur an average
36 of every 500 feet or more. Rural roads have no geographic center, except where punctuated
37 by rural centers.
38 8. Suburban road. "Suburban road" means an area along the frontage of a road where
39 incremental development slowly transitions a rural road to a suburban one. Suburban roads
40 have more frequent curb cuts than a rural road, typically occurring an average of every 500
41 feet or less. Buildings are typically located on lots of one to 3 acres, created through lot
42 splits and subdivisions of larger parcels of land. Development typically includes a range
43 of uses, including residential, commercial, industrial and office uses, each separated from
44 the other. Buildings are typically located within view of the road and each other, changing
45 the perception of the area from rural to suburban.
Page 18 - 132LR0289(01)

1 9. Village center. "Village center" means an area with a loose grouping of buildings
2 accommodating a variety of uses and serving as a center for commerce, living, education
3 and social interaction within a community. Village centers typically include a loose
4 network of streets, with a main street running through the center. The placement of
5 buildings on lots, the distance between buildings and the pattern of streets and blocks are
6 looser and more irregular than a downtown placetype.
7 Sec. 25. Director to convene stakeholder group. Prior to initiating rulemaking
8 as required by this Act, the Director of the Maine Office of Community Affairs shall
9 convene a stakeholder group for the purpose of soliciting input on the development of rules
10 necessary to implement the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 30-A, chapter 187, subchapter 2,
11 as amended by this Act. The stakeholder group may not exceed 17 members, excluding
12 the director. Members of the stakeholder group are as follows:
13 1. The Director of the Maine Office of Community Affairs;
14 2. The program director of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's
15 Municipal Planning Assistance Program;
16 3. A representative of the Housing Opportunity Program established in Title 5, section
17 13056-J, as designated by the program's director;
18 4. A representative of the climate resilience program, as designated by the program's
19 director;
