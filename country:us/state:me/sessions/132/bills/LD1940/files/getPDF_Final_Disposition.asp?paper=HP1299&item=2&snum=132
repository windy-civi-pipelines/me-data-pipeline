10 developed during the planning process. The strategies and timetable must guide the
11 subsequent adoption of policies, programs and land use ordinances and periodic review
12 of the comprehensive plan, including a capital investment plan for the replacement and
13 expansion of public facilities and services required to meet projected growth and
