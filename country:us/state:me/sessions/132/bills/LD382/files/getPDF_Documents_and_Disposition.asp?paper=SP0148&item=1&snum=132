2 CONCEPT DRAFT
3 SUMMARY
44 This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5 This bill would establish a fair and equitable system of revenue sharing for the
6 commercial, industrial and recreational use and management of Maine's coastal resources
7 that ensures a direct benefit to the communities most affected by the use of those resources
8 and that promotes statewide economic growth. The bill would establish a standardized fee
9 and royalty schedule for the use of those resources based on the type and scale of activities
10 conducted and a formula for the distribution of the revenue generated, with a portion of the
11 funds to be retained by the State to support the administration, enforcement and oversight
12 of coastal resource activities and a portion of the funds to be distributed to affected
13 communities and stakeholders. Under the bill, collection of established fees and royalties
14 and distribution of that revenue would be administered and overseen by a statutorily
15 established revenue sharing board consisting of representatives from state agencies,
16 municipal governments and other stakeholders.
