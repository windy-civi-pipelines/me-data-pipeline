1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 17-A MRSA §2002, sub-§3, ¶B, as amended by PL 2021, c. 296, §1, is
3 further amended to read:
4 B. "Critical investigation expense" means a necessary expense incurred by a
5 government or by a victim while investigating or prosecuting suspected criminal
6 conduct. "Critical investigation expense" is limited to the cost of an audit or other
7 financial analysis when that analysis is necessary to determine whether and to what
8 extent a victim has suffered financial harm from criminal conduct by an employee or
9 other person in a position of trust and the cost of analysis of suspected illegal drugs if
10 the defendant is convicted of trafficking a scheduled drug under chapter 45 and the
11 court in sentencing the defendant makes a finding that the conduct underlying the
12 conviction was motivated by profit.
13 SUMMARY
1144 This bill removes the provision in the Maine Criminal Code regarding economic loss
1155 in the law governing restitution that the cost of analysis of suspected illegal drugs be
1166 considered a critical investigation expense only if the defendant is convicted of trafficking
1177 a scheduled drug and the court in sentencing the defendant makes a finding that the conduct
1188 underlying the conviction was motivated by profit.
