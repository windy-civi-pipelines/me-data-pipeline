Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, the rule designating the formulary for naturopathic doctors has not been
updated since 1996; and
Whereas, there is a statutory inconsistency that restricts the authority of the Board of
Complementary Health Care Providers to amend the formulary by rule; and
Whereas, this legislation corrects that inconsistency and must take effect immediately
so that the process to update the formulary can begin; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore,
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
Sec. 1. 32 MRSA §12522, sub-§4, ¶B, as enacted by PL 1995, c. 671, §13, is
amended to read:

following categories: homeopathic remedies, vitamins and minerals, hormones, local
anesthesia and immunizations that are designated by rule by a subcommittee of the
board consisting of the naturopathic members, the pharmacist member and the
allopathic or osteopathic physician member, as consistent with a naturopathic doctor's
education and training. A naturopathic doctor may not prescribe psychotropic
medications.

Complementary Health Care Providers shall update the formulary for naturopathic doctors
