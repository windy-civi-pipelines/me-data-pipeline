1 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the creation of a statewide sexual assault forensic examination kit tracking
4 system and an inventory of all sexual assault forensic examination kits in the possession of
5 law enforcement agencies has already begun pursuant to a federal grant, which will end in
6 June 2025, leaving the tracking system and inventory only partially complete; and
7 Whereas, this legislation requires the establishment of a tracking system, allowing
8 the already started work to continue without interruption; and
9 Whereas, the immediate passage of this legislation is critical to strengthen the State's
10 enforcement of sexual assault laws and response to sexual assault; and
11 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
12 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
13 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
14 therefore,
15 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
16 Sec. 1. 24 MRSA §2986, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2019, c. 94, §1, is further
17 amended to read:
18 3. Completed kit. If the alleged victim has not reported the alleged offense to a law
19 enforcement agency when the examination is complete, the hospital or health care
20 practitioner shall then notify the nearest law enforcement agency, which shall transport and
21 store the completed forensic examination kit for 8 20 years. The completed kit may be
22 identified only by the tracking number. If during that storage period an alleged victim
23 decides to report the alleged offense to a law enforcement agency, the alleged victim may
24 contact the hospital or health care practitioner to determine the tracking number. The
25 hospital or health care practitioner shall provide the alleged victim with the tracking
26 number on the forensic examination kit and shall inform the alleged victim which law
27 enforcement agency is storing the kit.
28 An alleged victim who has not reported the alleged offense to a law enforcement agency
29 may request that a completed forensic examination kit be transported to the Maine State
30 Police Crime Laboratory and be processed by signing a consent form indicating that the
31 alleged victim wants the kit to be tested, and the results of the analysis must be kept
32 anonymous.
33 If the alleged victim reports the alleged offense to a law enforcement agency by the time
34 the examination is complete, the investigating agency shall retain custody of the forensic
35 examination kit.
36 If an examination is performed under subsection 5 and the alleged victim does not, within
37 60 days, regain a state of consciousness adequate to decide whether or not to report the
38 alleged offense, the State may file a motion in the District Court relating to storing or
39 processing the forensic examination kit. Upon finding good cause and after considering
40 factors, including, but not limited to, the possible benefits to public safety in processing the
41 kit and the likelihood of the alleged victim's regaining a state of consciousness adequate to
42 decide whether or not to report the alleged offense in a reasonable time, the District Court
43 may order either that the kit be stored for additional time or that the kit be transported to
Page 1 - 132LR0053(01)

414 the Maine State Police Crime Laboratory for processing, or such other disposition that the
425 court determines just. In the interests of justice or upon motion by the State, the District
436 Court may conduct hearings required under this paragraph confidentially and in camera
447 and may impound pleadings and other records related to them.
5 A law enforcement agency shall store a completed forensic examination kit involving
6 alleged sexual assault for 20 years regardless of whether the alleged offense is reported to
7 a law enforcement agency.
8 Beginning January 1, 2027, completed forensic examination kits must be transported to the
9 Maine State Police Crime Laboratory and be processed.
10 Beginning January 1, 2027, and every 5 years thereafter, a law enforcement agency shall

14 State Police Crime Laboratory shall process those kits on a rolling basis. The Department

10 SUMMARY
1111 This bill directs the Department of Public Safety to establish, operate and maintain a
1122 sexual assault forensic examination kit tracking system. The system must provide relevant
1133 information for victims, both those who choose to report to a law enforcement agency and
1144 those who choose not to report, and other approved users regarding the processing, custody,
1155 analysis and destruction of evidence. The department is required to submit an annual report
1166 beginning January 1, 2027 to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having
1177 jurisdiction over criminal justice and public safety matters and the Governor concerning
1188 information related to the status of sexual assault forensic examination kits reported in the
1199 tracking system. The bill provides requirements for the tracking system and requires the
2200 department to adopt routine technical rules, including rules regarding participation in the
2211 tracking system, confidentiality and the operation of the tracking system.
22 The bill directs that, by June 1, 2026, a law enforcement agency that receives,
23 maintains, stores or preserves sexual assault forensic examination kits must complete an
24 inventory of all kits in its possession and report its findings to the Department of Public
25 Safety. The department must compile all agency reports and present findings of the
26 inventory by January 1, 2027 to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having
27 jurisdiction over criminal justice and public safety matters and at the same time post the
28 report on the department’s publicly accessible website.
29 Public Law 2023, chapter 236 changed a provision in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title
30 25 to require law enforcement agencies to store sexual assault forensic examination kits for
31 20 years. For consistency with that provision, this bill amends a provision in Title 24 to
32 require law enforcement agencies to store sexual assault forensic examination kits for 20
33 years.
34 The bill allows an alleged victim who has not reported an alleged offense to a law
35 enforcement agency to request that a completed kit be transported to the Maine State Police
36 Crime Laboratory to be processed by signing a consent form, and the results of the analysis
37 must be kept anonymous.
38 The bill requires that, beginning January 1, 2027, and every 5 years thereafter, all
39 completed kits that identify an alleged victim and are being stored by a law enforcement
40 agency must be transported to the Maine State Police Crime Laboratory and be processed
41 on a rolling basis, beginning with kits most recently stored.
Page 6 - 132LR0053(01)
