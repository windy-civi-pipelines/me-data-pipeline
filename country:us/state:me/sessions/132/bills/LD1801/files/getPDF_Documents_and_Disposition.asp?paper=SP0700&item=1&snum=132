15 SUMMARY
1166 This bill is reported out by the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary to implement
1177 recommendations of the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services. The committee
1188 has not taken a position on the substance of this bill. By reporting this bill out, the
1199 committee is not suggesting and does not intend to suggest that it agrees or disagrees with
2200 any aspect of this bill; instead, the committee is reporting the bill out for the sole purpose
2211 of having a bill printed that can be referred to the committee for an appropriate public
2222 hearing and subsequent processing in the normal course. The committee is taking this
2233 action to ensure clarity and transparency in the legislative review of the proposals contained
2244 in the bill.
25 The bill amends the definition of "indigent legal services" to include services that an
26 attorney performs at the direction of the commission and makes technical amendments to
27 the definitions of "employed counsel" and "public defender." It also provides that training
28 materials prepared or obtained by the commission in connection with providing or
29 preparing to provide training and evaluation programs for attorneys who are or may seek
30 to become assigned counsel, employed counsel, public defenders or contract counsel are
31 confidential, even if those materials are disseminated, for example at a commission-offered
32 training, in the furtherance of the commission's duties. Finally, the bill provides that a court
33 must, on request, disclose otherwise confidential records associated with child protection
34 actions to the commission for purposes of assigning, evaluating or supervising counsel.
