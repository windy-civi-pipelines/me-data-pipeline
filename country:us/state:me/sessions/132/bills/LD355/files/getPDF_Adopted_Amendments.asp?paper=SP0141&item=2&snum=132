29 of participation in the program. The amount of any penalty imposed by the board on a
30 covered employer for the failure to enroll a covered employee without reasonable cause
31 may not exceed the amounts set forth in this paragraph and is determined as follows:

425 requirements with respect to each covered employee by the end of the 90-day period
436 beginning on the first date the covered employer knew, or exercising reasonable
447 diligence would have known, that the failure existed. The covered employer is deemed
458 to have known that the failure existed after receiving 3 communications from the
469 program.
7 D. In the case of a failure that is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, all
8 or part of the penalty may be waived to the extent that the payment of the penalty would
9 be excessive or otherwise inequitable relative to the failure involved.
10 E. If a covered employer fails to remit a payroll deduction contribution to the program
11 on the earliest date the amount withheld from the covered employee's compensation
12 can reasonably be segregated from the covered employer's assets, but not later than the
13 15th day of the month following the month in which the covered employee's
14 contribution amounts are withheld from the covered employee's paycheck, the failure
15 to remit the contribution on a timely basis is subject to the same penalties as apply to

17 specified in paragraph A.

25 SUMMARY
2266 This amendment makes the following changes to the bill.

28 to offer the Maine Retirement Savings Program and maintains the requirement in current
29 law applying to covered employers with 5 or more employees.
30 2. It codifies language from rules that allow an employer to enroll a covered employee
31 at any time between the date of hire and the 120th date of employment.
32 3. It removes the requirement that an employer must automatically reenroll an
33 employee that has opted out of the program on an annual basis and instead allows an
34 employee to be provided the opportunity to be reenrolled.
35 4. It makes the establishment and enforcement of penalties against employers that fail
36 to enroll their employees in the program discretionary rather than mandatory and specifies
37 that the amount of any penalty may not exceed the amount set forth in current law. It delays
38 the starting dates that employers may be subject to financial penalties for failing to enroll
39 their employees by one year.
