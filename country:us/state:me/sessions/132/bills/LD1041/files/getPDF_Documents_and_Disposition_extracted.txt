19 Failure to provide notice as required by this subsection does not reduce the 90-day period

21 may submit, in writing, the intention to pursue the option described in subsection 2.
22 Sec. 4. 30-A MRSA §4973, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2023, c. 218, §4, is further

26 section at its current appraised value, as determined by appraisers for the owner of the
27 property and the holder that has stated the intention to exercise the option to purchase
28 within 90 days of receiving the notice required by subsection 1. The municipal housing
29 authority must have opportunity to exercise the option to purchase. The holder has the
30 option throughout the 90-day period. Failure to exercise the option to purchase within 90
31 days constitutes a waiver of that option by the holder. By stating in writing its intention to
32 pursue its option during the 90-day period, the holder has an additional 90 days, beginning

36 day period and any agreed upon extension beginning on the date the appraised value is
37 determined is automatically extended for any additional time required to obtain
38 governmental approvals of any sale or transfer transaction and an additional 60 days after
39 receipt of approval. The holder has the right to assign its option to a nonprofit corporation
40 upon such terms as the holder may determine, including, but not limited to, requiring the
41 assignee to agree to additional income eligibility restrictions and rental restrictions for a
42 duration as determined by the holder.
43 A. Nothing in this This section prevents may not prevent an owner of the property

Page 2 - 132LR0798(01)
415 withdrawal or revocation, or failure to close on a sale pursuant to the option within the
426 time provided in this subsection, extinguishes any option held by the holder or an
437 assignee.
4 Sec. 5. 30-A MRSA §4973, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2023, c. 218, §4, is further
5 amended to read:

7 contract with the seller, agrees to maintain the property as low-income housing without any
8 termination or other modification to the income eligibility restrictions or rental affordability
9 restrictions or financial assistance applicable to the property. The notice provisions of this
10 section apply to this subchapter.
11 Sec. 6. 30-A MRSA §4973, as amended by PL 2023, c. 218, §4, is further amended
12 by enacting at the end a new paragraph to read:
13 The notice provisions of this section apply to this subchapter.
14 Sec. 7. 30-A MRSA §4976, first ¶, as amended by PL 1993, c. 175, §12, is further
15 amended to read:
16 Any owner or purchaser of low-income rental housing who sells, transfers title or takes
17 other action in regard to that property that would result in the termination of financial
18 assistance designed to make a rental unit affordable to low-income or moderate-income
19 people shall allow the current tenants to remain in the dwelling units for 6 months from the
20 date of sale, transfer of title or other action in regard to the property, at the same rents or
21 portion of the total rents charged to the tenants before that sale, transfer of title or other
22 action in regard to the property, or the owner may relocate the tenants to comparable units
23 with comparable rents in accordance with the procedure established by rules of the Maine
24 State Housing Authority.
25 SUMMARY
2266 This bill amends the notice an owner of an affordable rental housing property is
2277 required to provide when the limitation of the rent amount an owner may charge or the
2288 income a person or family needs to qualify to rent in an affordable housing development is

3300 financial assistance or other action taken by the owner. The notice requirements for the
3311 end of the limitation due to the termination of federal and state financial assistance is set at

3333 assistance will end in less than 2 years from the effective date of this legislation. The notice
3344 requirement for any other termination of the limitation remains at 90 days. The bill makes
3355 other changes to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 30-A, subchapter 12 to adjust for the
3366 amended language.
