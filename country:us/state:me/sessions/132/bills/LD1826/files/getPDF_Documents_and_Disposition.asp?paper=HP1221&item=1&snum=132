1144 statutory changes recommended by the Right to Know Advisory Committee. The joint
1155 standing committee has not taken a position on the substance of this bill. By reporting this
1166 bill out, the joint standing committee is not suggesting and does not intend to suggest that

1188 bill out for the sole purpose of having a bill printed that can be referred to the committee

2200 joint standing committee is taking this action to ensure clarity and transparency in the
2211 legislative review of the proposals contained in the bill.
22 The bill adds a new section of law in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5 to make
23 confidential personally identifiable information obtained in furtherance of the Permanent
24 Commission on the Status of Racial, Indigenous and Tribal Populations' duties pursuant to
25 Title 5, section 25007, subsection 1, paragraph A to carry out research necessary to
26 determine the status of historically disadvantaged racial, indigenous and tribal populations,
27 except that the executive director may authorize disclosure of personally identifiable
28 information if the executive director has obtained the consent of the individual to whom
29 the personally identifiable information applies.
