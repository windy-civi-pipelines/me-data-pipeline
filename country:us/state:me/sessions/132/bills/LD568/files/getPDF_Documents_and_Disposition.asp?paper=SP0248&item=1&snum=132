1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 35-A MRSA §3212, sub-§2, ¶B, as enacted by PL 1997, c. 316, §3, is
3 amended to read:
4 B. The commission shall establish the maximum duration of a standard-offer service
5 contract after considering is 6 months. In choosing a standard-offer service provider,
6 the commission shall consider all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, market
7 risks and the need for price stability and contract flexibility. If at the expiration of a
8 contract the commission rejects all bids submitted for a new contract, the expiring
9 contract must continue until the commission accepts a bid for a new contract. If at the
10 expiration of a contract the standard-offer service provider submits a bid that increases
11 the rate for electricity that was offered in the expiring contract, the provider must
12 include justification for the rate increase.
13 SUMMARY
1144 This bill limits standard-offer electricity service provider contracts to 6 months and
1155 requires that if at the end of the contract the Public Utilities Commission rejects all bids for
1166 a new standard-offer service contract, the expiring contract continues until the commission
1177 accepts a bid for a new contract. The bill also requires that if at the end of a standard-offer
1188 electricity service contract the current standard-offer service provider submits a bid for a
1199 new contract at a higher rate for electricity than the expiring contract, the provider must
2200 include justification for the rate increase.
