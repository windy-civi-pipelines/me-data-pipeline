Resolve, Directing the Public Utilities Commission to Evaluate Different
Procurement Methods for Standard-offer Service
Sec. 1. Evaluation of standard-offer service procurement methods.
Resolved: That the Public Utilities Commission shall evaluate differing methods to
procure standard-offer service pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section
3212, including, but not limited to, establishing supply contracts of varying lengths that
may include soliciting bids for the procurement of standard-offer service more frequently
than once per year. The commission shall consider methods to procure standard-offer
service that are likely to result in:
1. Improved bid quality and quantity;
2. Lower electricity rates for customers; and
3. Electricity rate stability.
Sec. 2. Report. Resolved: That, no later than January 2, 2026, the Public Utilities
Commission shall submit to the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities and
Technology a report that:
1. Details the commission's evaluation under section 1;
2. Identifies whether the commission changed its procurement strategy for standard-
offer service beginning January 1, 2026 and whether any of the results identified in section
1 were achieved or are likely to be achieved;
3. Provides the commission's rationale if the commission did not change the
procurement strategy for standard-offer service beginning January 1, 2026; and
4. Includes other relevant information.
The committee may report out a bill related to the report to the Second Regular Session
of the 132nd Legislature.
