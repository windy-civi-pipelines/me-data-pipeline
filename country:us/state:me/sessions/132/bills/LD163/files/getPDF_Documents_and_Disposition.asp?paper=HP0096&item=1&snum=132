33 include nonprescription oral hormonal contraceptives and nonprescription emergency
44 contraceptives approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration. The bill provides
55 that a prescription is not required for insurance coverage for nonprescription oral hormonal
66 contraceptives and nonprescription emergency contraceptives and requires insurers to
77 establish mechanisms to ensure that an enrollee who purchases a nonprescription oral
88 hormonal contraceptive or nonprescription emergency contraceptive at a pharmacy has the
99 option to make the purchase pursuant to a standing order issued for billing purposes without
1100 a payment required at the point of sale or to make the purchase with a payment at the point
1111 of sale and submit a claim for reimbursement to the insurer. The requirements apply
1122 beginning January 1, 2026.
13 The bill requires health insurance carriers to notify enrollees, at least annually, of the
14 coverage requirements for contraceptive supplies and the procedures an enrollee must
15 follow to access coverage for nonprescription oral hormonal contraceptives and
16 nonprescription emergency contraceptives at a pharmacy without an out-of-pocket cost at
17 the point of sale or by submitting a claim for reimbursement. The bill also authorizes the
18 Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, Bureau of Insurance to adopt rules
19 to implement the provisions and also requires the bureau to monitor implementation by
20 health insurance carriers and to report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature
21 having jurisdiction over health coverage, insurance and financial services matters no later
22 than November 4, 2026.
