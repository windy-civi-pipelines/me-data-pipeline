4 SUMMARY
55 This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, strikes language in the
66 bill authorizing a pharmacist to use a standing order to facilitate billing for a
77 nonprescription oral hormonal contraceptive or nonprescription emergency contraceptive
88 and clarifies that enrollees must purchase contraceptives at the pharmacy counter in order
99 to be reimbursed by a health insurance carrier for an out-of-pocket payment. The
1100 amendment also removes from the bill the requirement that the Department of Professional
1111 and Financial Regulation, Bureau of Insurance submit a report to the Legislature but retains
1122 language requiring the bureau to monitor compliance with the bill's requirements on an
1133 ongoing basis.
