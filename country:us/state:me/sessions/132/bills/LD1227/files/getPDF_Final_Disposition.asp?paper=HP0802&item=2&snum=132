9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “ ” to H.P. 802, L.D. 1227, “An Act to Repeal the
10 Requirement That Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Equip Vehicles with a Standardized Data
11 Access Platform”
12 Amend the bill by inserting after the title and before the enacting clause the following:
13 'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
14 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
15 Whereas, Initiated Bill 2023, chapter 3 took effect on January 5, 2024, requiring
16 motor vehicle manufacturers to make mechanical data emanating directly from a motor
17 vehicle available to the motor vehicle owner and 3rd parties via a standardized platform;
18 and
19 Whereas, pending litigation in this State and in multiple jurisdictions regarding
20 similar laws has resulted in significant uncertainty for vehicle owners, manufacturers and
21 repair shops and, in some cases, the deactivation of the telematics systems to comply with
22 overlapping or conflicting regulations; and
23 Whereas, the automotive right to repair statute directly impacts the security of
24 consumer data in this State and creates ambiguity in the secure management and
25 transmission of information from a telematics system; and
26 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
27 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
28 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
29 therefore,'
30 Amend the bill by adding before the summary the following:
31 'Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation
32 takes effect when approved.'
33 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section
