36 facility or manufacturing facility that, prior to January 1, 2026, was issued by the
37 department a registration or other authorization to operate and was subsequently denied
38 such registration or other authorization based solely on the failure of the caregiver retail
39 store, registered dispensary, cannabis testing facility or manufacturing facility to obtain a
40 completed form provided by the department to demonstrate municipal approval or other
41 local authorization, or based solely on the failure of the municipality to adopt or amend an

5 SUMMARY
66 This bill makes the following changes to the Maine Medical Use of Cannabis Act.
7 1. It amends the definition of "caregiver retail store" to clarify that it is a retail store
8 with regular business hours at a location accessible to the general public where a registered
9 caregiver sells cannabis paraphernalia, cannabis plants, harvested cannabis, related
10 supplies or educational materials to qualifying patients without an appointment and other
11 items to the general public. It provides that a caregiver retail store does not include an
12 office at a location not accessible to the general public where a registered caregiver
13 provides consultation services, cannabis paraphernalia, cannabis plants, harvested
14 cannabis, related supplies or educational materials to qualifying patients by appointment.
15 2. It prohibits the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, except where
16 explicitly authorized or directed by law, from requiring a registered caregiver, registered
17 dispensary, cannabis testing facility or manufacturing facility to use a form issued by the
18 department in complying with the requirements of the Act or of adopted rules and from
19 issuing a guidance document or memorandum to such persons regarding compliance by
20 those persons with the requirements of the Act or of adopted rules. The bill directs the
21 department’s Office of Cannabis Policy to, as expeditiously as possible, rescind and
22 remove from public availability any noncompliant forms and guidance documents or
23 memoranda.
24 3. It repeals the provision of law that authorizes a caregiver to receive reasonable
25 monetary compensation for costs associated with cultivating cannabis plants or assisting a
26 qualifying patient with that patient's medical use of cannabis.
27 4. It provides that a caregiver is authorized to transport, sell, offer to sell or furnish
28 cannabis plants or harvested cannabis on the property or premises owned, leased or rented
29 by the caregiver; at trade shows, festivals or other cannabis industry-related events; or
30 through delivery to or private arrangement with a qualifying patient, caregiver or registered
31 dispensary.
32 5. It removes the process under the Act by which a person that is not a qualifying
33 patient, registered caregiver, registered dispensary or manufacturing facility may receive
34 authorization from the department to engage in cannabis extraction using an inherently
35 hazardous substance and prohibits such cannabis extraction other than by qualifying
36 patients, registered caregivers, registered dispensaries or manufacturing facilities. A
37 qualifying patient, registered caregiver, registered dispensary or manufacturing facility that
38 engages in cannabis extraction using an inherently hazardous substance must comply with
39 any rules regarding that activity adopted by the department by rule but is not required to
40 obtain additional approvals or authorizations from the department to do so.
41 6. It prohibits the department from posting on its publicly accessible website or
42 otherwise making publicly available, except upon request, applications, supporting
43 information and other nonconfidential information regarding a registered caregiver,
44 including any address where the registered caregiver cultivates, manufactures, tests,
Page 8 - 132LR0989(01)
415 packages, stores or sells cannabis plants or harvested cannabis under this chapter. The bill
426 directs the office to, as expeditiously as possible, remove from the office's website and
437 otherwise from public availability, except upon request, any such nonconfidential
448 information regarding registered caregivers.
5 7. It prohibits the department from requiring a caregiver retail store, registered
6 dispensary, cannabis testing facility or manufacturing facility to use a form provided by the
7 department to demonstrate municipal approval or other local authorization, if such approval
8 or authorization is required by the municipality in which the store, dispensary or facility is
9 seeking to operate.
10 8. It provides that a caregiver retail store, registered dispensary, cannabis testing
11 facility or manufacturing facility that was previously issued by the department a
12 registration or other authorization to operate and was subsequently denied such registration
13 or other authorization based solely on the failure of the store, dispensary or facility to obtain
14 a completed form provided by the department to demonstrate municipal approval or other
15 local authorization, or based solely on the failure of the municipality to adopt or amend an
16 ordinance or approve a warrant article as required by law, is deemed in compliance with
17 applicable municipal approval or local authorization requirements under the Act. A
18 caregiver retail store, registered dispensary, cannabis testing facility or manufacturing
19 facility deemed in compliance with applicable municipal approval or local authorization
20 requirements pursuant to this provision may request and the department shall issue a
21 registration or other authorization to renew operations, provided that: the store, dispensary

15 and approval of the store, dispensary or facility for the use of the premises consistent with
16 conduct authorized under this chapter, including, but not limited to, a conditional use
17 approval or site plan approval. "Municipal approval" does not include issuance of a

35 chapter to the contrary, a caregiver retail store, registered dispensary, cannabis testing
36 facility or manufacturing facility that, prior to January 1, 2026, was issued by the
37 department a registration or other authorization to operate and was subsequently denied
38 such registration or other authorization based solely on the failure of the caregiver retail
39 store, registered dispensary, cannabis testing facility or manufacturing facility to obtain a
40 completed form provided by the department to demonstrate municipal approval or other
41 local authorization, or based solely on the failure of the municipality to adopt or amend an
42 ordinance or approve a warrant article as required by subsection 3, is deemed in compliance

560 authorization to operate by the department; and the caregiver retail store, registered
571 dispensary, cannabis testing facility or manufacturing facility satisfies all other applicable
582 registration or authorization requirements pursuant to this chapter and the rules adopted
593 pursuant to this chapter, excluding any such requirements relating to municipal approval
1504 or local authorization and any such requirements that the caregiver retail store, registered

Page 7 - 132LR0989(01)

416 including any address where the registered caregiver cultivates, manufactures, tests,

438 Medical Use of Cannabis Act, and shall otherwise ensure that such information is no longer
449 made publicly available, except upon request.
5 SUMMARY
66 This bill makes the following changes to the Maine Medical Use of Cannabis Act.
7 1. It amends the definition of "caregiver retail store" to clarify that it is a retail store
8 with regular business hours at a location accessible to the general public where a registered
9 caregiver sells cannabis paraphernalia, cannabis plants, harvested cannabis, related
10 supplies or educational materials to qualifying patients without an appointment and other
11 items to the general public. It provides that a caregiver retail store does not include an
12 office at a location not accessible to the general public where a registered caregiver
13 provides consultation services, cannabis paraphernalia, cannabis plants, harvested
14 cannabis, related supplies or educational materials to qualifying patients by appointment.
15 2. It prohibits the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, except where
16 explicitly authorized or directed by law, from requiring a registered caregiver, registered
17 dispensary, cannabis testing facility or manufacturing facility to use a form issued by the
18 department in complying with the requirements of the Act or of adopted rules and from
19 issuing a guidance document or memorandum to such persons regarding compliance by
20 those persons with the requirements of the Act or of adopted rules. The bill directs the
21 department’s Office of Cannabis Policy to, as expeditiously as possible, rescind and
22 remove from public availability any noncompliant forms and guidance documents or
23 memoranda.
24 3. It repeals the provision of law that authorizes a caregiver to receive reasonable
25 monetary compensation for costs associated with cultivating cannabis plants or assisting a
26 qualifying patient with that patient's medical use of cannabis.
27 4. It provides that a caregiver is authorized to transport, sell, offer to sell or furnish
28 cannabis plants or harvested cannabis on the property or premises owned, leased or rented
29 by the caregiver; at trade shows, festivals or other cannabis industry-related events; or
30 through delivery to or private arrangement with a qualifying patient, caregiver or registered
31 dispensary.
32 5. It removes the process under the Act by which a person that is not a qualifying
33 patient, registered caregiver, registered dispensary or manufacturing facility may receive
34 authorization from the department to engage in cannabis extraction using an inherently
35 hazardous substance and prohibits such cannabis extraction other than by qualifying
36 patients, registered caregivers, registered dispensaries or manufacturing facilities. A
37 qualifying patient, registered caregiver, registered dispensary or manufacturing facility that
38 engages in cannabis extraction using an inherently hazardous substance must comply with
39 any rules regarding that activity adopted by the department by rule but is not required to
40 obtain additional approvals or authorizations from the department to do so.
41 6. It prohibits the department from posting on its publicly accessible website or
42 otherwise making publicly available, except upon request, applications, supporting
43 information and other nonconfidential information regarding a registered caregiver,
44 including any address where the registered caregiver cultivates, manufactures, tests,
Page 8 - 132LR0989(01)

415 packages, stores or sells cannabis plants or harvested cannabis under this chapter. The bill
426 directs the office to, as expeditiously as possible, remove from the office's website and
437 otherwise from public availability, except upon request, any such nonconfidential
448 information regarding registered caregivers.
5 7. It prohibits the department from requiring a caregiver retail store, registered
6 dispensary, cannabis testing facility or manufacturing facility to use a form provided by the
7 department to demonstrate municipal approval or other local authorization, if such approval
8 or authorization is required by the municipality in which the store, dispensary or facility is
9 seeking to operate.
10 8. It provides that a caregiver retail store, registered dispensary, cannabis testing
11 facility or manufacturing facility that was previously issued by the department a
12 registration or other authorization to operate and was subsequently denied such registration
13 or other authorization based solely on the failure of the store, dispensary or facility to obtain
14 a completed form provided by the department to demonstrate municipal approval or other
15 local authorization, or based solely on the failure of the municipality to adopt or amend an
16 ordinance or approve a warrant article as required by law, is deemed in compliance with
17 applicable municipal approval or local authorization requirements under the Act. A
18 caregiver retail store, registered dispensary, cannabis testing facility or manufacturing
19 facility deemed in compliance with applicable municipal approval or local authorization
20 requirements pursuant to this provision may request and the department shall issue a
21 registration or other authorization to renew operations, provided that: the store, dispensary
22 or facility is to be located in the same municipality in which it was located when last issued
23 a registration or other authorization to operate by the department; and the store, dispensary
24 or facility satisfies all other applicable registration or authorization requirements pursuant
25 to the Act and adopted rules, excluding any such requirements relating to municipal
26 approval or local authorization and any such requirements that the store, dispensary or
27 facility maintain continuous operation since it was last issued a registration or other
28 authorization to operate by the department.
29 9. It provides that the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, in its
30 annual report to the Legislature regarding the medical cannabis program, must include
31 information regarding the gross sales of cannabis for medical use for the current and prior
32 fiscal years.
33 10. It directs the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Office of
34 Cannabis Policy, on or before January 9, 2026, to provisionally adopt and submit for
35 legislative review major substantive rules necessary to implement the medical cannabis
36 research grant program in accordance with the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, section
37 2430, subsection 5.
