8 SUMMARY
99 This bill establishes a managed care program for MaineCare services.
10 The bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to issue a request for
11 proposals to contract with 3 managed care organizations to provide MaineCare services.
12 Managed care refers to a system of delivering services through arrangements with selected
13 providers to furnish health care services and financial incentives for patients to use the
14 participating providers and procedures included in the managed care program. The model
15 also requires that the department reimburse the managed care organizations primarily using
16 negotiated monthly rate per enrollee, rather than a fee-for-service model.
17 The bill establishes a number of requirements for developing the procurement process
18 and essential contract terms. The bill establishes deadlines by which specific categories of
19 eligible enrollees must be enrolled in the managed care program, beginning February 1,
20 2029. The department must submit a report to the Legislature by December 3, 2025
21 detailing its plan for implementing the program within the timeline established by this
22 legislation. The bill also includes a deadline of April 1, 2026, by which time the department
23 must submit all waivers and amendments for the state Medicaid plan that are necessary to
24 implement this legislation. The department is authorized to adopt rules. Rules adopted are
25 considered major substantive rules under the Maine Administrative Procedure Act.
