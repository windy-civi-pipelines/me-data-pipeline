11 Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following:
12 'An Act to Amend the Law Prohibiting Places of Business from Being Open to the
13 Public on Sundays and Holidays'
14 Amend the bill by striking out all of section 2 and inserting the following:
15 'Sec. 2. 17 MRSA §3204, sub-§2, ¶HH, as enacted by PL 2003, c. 452, Pt. I, §55
16 and affected by Pt. X, §2, is amended to read:
17 HH. Stores with more than 5,000 square feet of interior customer selling space that
18 engage in retail sales and that do not require, as a condition of employment, that their
19 employees work on Sundays. If an employer decreases the average weekly work hours
20 of an employee who has declined to work on Sundays, it is prima facie evidence that
21 the employer has required Sunday work as a condition of employment in violation of
22 this section, unless the employer and employee agreed that the employee would work
23 on Sundays when the employee was initially hired. In no event, however, may any
24 store having more than 5,000 square feet of interior customer selling space be open on
25 Easter Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day, except that a grocery store as
26 defined in Title 22, section 2491, subsection 7-B that has no more than 10,000 square
27 feet of interior customer selling space may be open on Thanksgiving Day.'
28 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section
29 number to read consecutively.
