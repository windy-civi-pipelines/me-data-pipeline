24 SUMMARY
2255 This amendment revises the definition of "opportunity buying" to mean the purchasing
2266 of food and food products from Maine food producers, rather than from vendors at a
2277 significant discount as proposed in the bill, that are only available for a short period of time
2288 before the food or food products become unavailable for purchase. The amendment defines
2299 "state institutions" as the Department of Corrections; the Dorothea Dix Psychiatric Center
3300 and the Riverview Psychiatric Center within the Department of Health and Human
3311 Services; and the Maine Veterans' Homes for the purpose of the Maine foods procurement
3322 program proposed in the bill. The amendment specifies the responsibilities of the
3333 institutional food procurement coordinator within the Department of Agriculture,
3344 Conservation and Forestry.
35 The amendment also provides that state institutions may negotiate directly with Maine
36 food producers and execute agreements for off-contract purchases of food by commodity
37 type and provides that food or food products purchased under an off-contract purchase
38 agreement may be priced up to 15% higher than the same food or food product available
39 under contract.
40 The amendment removes from the bill the requirement that the coordinator convene an
41 annual meeting. Instead, the amendment authorizes the coordinator to convene an annual
42 meeting to the extent practicable and within existing resources.
