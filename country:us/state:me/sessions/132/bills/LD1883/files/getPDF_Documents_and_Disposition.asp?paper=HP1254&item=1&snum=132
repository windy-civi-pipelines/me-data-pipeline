27 assumes financial responsibility for care provided under the terms of the contract along
28 with additional health care benefits covered by the All Maine Health Plan. Retirees who
29 elect to reside out of the State are eligible for benefits under the terms and conditions of the
30 retirees' employer-employee contract. The board may establish financial arrangements

413 Maine Health Plan replaces those programs. The board shall adopt rules to insure the All
424 Maine Health Plan against unforeseen expenditures or revenue shortfalls not covered by

8 unearned income, and a business health tax based on payroll;

11 D. Coordinate with existing, ongoing funding sources from federal and state programs;
12 E. Base the premium structure developed under paragraph B on ability to pay; and
13 F. Before implementation, submit to the Governor and the Legislature a report on the

16 2. Federal funds. All federal funding received by the State, including the premium
17 subsidies under the federal Affordable Care Act, is appropriated to the All Maine Health
18 Fund to be used to administer the All Maine Health Plan under this chapter. Federal
19 funding that is received for implementing and administering the All Maine Health Plan
20 must be used to provide health care for residents of this State.
21 3. Funds from outside sources. Institutional providers operating under All Maine
22 Health Plan operating budgets may raise and expend funds from sources other than the All
23 Maine Health Plan, including private donors.
24 4. Governmental payments. The Governor and, if required under federal law, the
25 Commissioner of Health and Human Services and the Commissioner of Economic and
26 Community Development shall seek all necessary waivers, exemptions, agreements and
27 legislation so that all applicable federal payments to the State, including the premium tax
28 credits under the federal Affordable Care Act, are paid directly to the All Maine Health
29 Fund. When all required waivers, exemptions, agreements and legislation are obtained, the
30 All Maine Health Plan assumes responsibility for all health care benefits and health care
31 services previously paid for with federal funds. In obtaining the waivers, exemptions,
32 agreements or legislation, the Governor and, if required, commissioners shall seek from the
33 Federal Government a contribution for health care services in the State that reflects:
34 medical inflation, the state gross domestic product, the size and age of the population of
35 the State, the number of residents of the State living below the poverty level and the number
36 of individuals in this State eligible for Medicare and services from the United States
37 Department of Veterans Affairs and that does not decrease in relation to the federal
38 contributions to other states as a result of the waivers, exemptions, agreements or savings
39 from implementation of the All Maine Health Plan.
40 5. Federal preemption. The board shall seek to secure a repeal or a waiver of any
41 provision of federal law that preempts any provision of this chapter. The Commissioner of
42 Health and Human Services shall provide all necessary assistance in this matter. In the
43 application for an innovation waiver under Section 1332 of the federal Affordable Care
Page 6 - 132LR1436(01)

414 Act, the board shall request to waive any provisions of the federal Social Security Act and
425 any of the following provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act to the extent necessary
436 to implement this Act:
4 A. In 42 United States Code, Sections 18021 to 18024;
5 B. In 42 United States Code, Sections 18031 to 18033;
6 C. In 42 United States Code, Section 18071; and
7 D. In 26 United States Code, Sections 36B and 5000A.
8 The request for a waiver of the federal Social Security Act must seek authorization for the
9 All Maine Health Plan to operate as a Medicare Advantage plan for eligible individuals.
10 If a repeal or a waiver of law or regulations cannot be secured, the board shall adopt rules,
11 or seek conforming state legislation or state plan amendments, consistent with federal law,
12 in an effort to best fulfill the purposes of this chapter.
13 6. Secondary to federal government programs. The All Maine Health Plan's
14 responsibility for providing care is secondary to existing federal government programs for
15 health care services to the extent that funding for these programs is not transferred to the
16 All Maine Health Fund or that the transfer is delayed beyond the date on which initial
17 benefits are provided under the All Maine Health Plan.
18 7. Minimal cost sharing. The board may impose a minimal deductible, copayment,
19 coinsurance or other cost-sharing requirement with respect to covered benefits.
20 §7808. Subrogation
21 1. Collateral source. If coverage of an individual by other payers for health care has
22 been terminated, All Maine Health shall seek to collect the cost of medical services
23 provided to the individual that are, or may be, covered services under a policy of insurance
24 from any other collateral source available to that individual, or to collect the cost of medical
25 services when the individual has a right of action for compensation for those services under
26 law.
27 A. As used in this section, "collateral source" includes:
28 (1) Health insurance policies and the medical components of automobile,
29 homeowner's and other forms of insurance;
30 (2) Medical components of workers' compensation;
31 (3) Pension plans;
32 (4) Employer plans;
33 (5) Employee benefit contracts;
34 (6) Government benefit programs;
35 (7) A judgment for damages for personal injury;
36 (8) The state of last domicile for individuals moving to the State for medical care
37 who have extraordinary medical needs; and
38 (9) Any 3rd party who is or may be liable to an individual for health care services
39 or costs.
Page 7 - 132LR1436(01)

1 B. As used in this section, "collateral source" does not include:
2 (1) A contract or plan that is subject to federal preemption; or
3 (2) Any governmental unit, agency or service to the extent that subrogation is
4 prohibited by law. An entity described in paragraph A is not excluded from the
5 obligations imposed by this section by virtue of a contract or relationship with a
6 governmental unit, agency or service.
7 C. The board shall negotiate waivers, seek federal legislation or make other
8 arrangements to incorporate collateral sources into the All Maine Health Plan.
9 2. Notification. When an individual who receives health care services under the All
10 Maine Health Plan is entitled to coverage, reimbursement, indemnity or other
11 compensation from a collateral source, the individual shall notify the health care provider
12 and provide information identifying the collateral source, the nature and extent of coverage
13 or entitlement and other relevant information. The health care provider shall forward this
14 information to the board. The individual entitled to coverage, reimbursement, indemnity
15 or other compensation from a collateral source shall provide additional information as
16 requested by the board.
17 3. Reimbursement. The All Maine Health Board shall seek reimbursement from the
18 collateral source for services provided to the individual and may institute appropriate
19 action, including legal proceedings, to recover the reimbursement. Upon demand, the
20 collateral source shall pay to the All Maine Health Fund the sums it would have paid or
21 expended on behalf of the individual for the health care services provided by the All Maine
22 Health Plan.
23 A. In addition to any other right to recovery provided in this section, the board has the
24 same right to recover the reasonable value of health care benefits from a collateral
25 source as provided to the Commissioner of Health and Human Services.
26 B. If a collateral source is exempt from subrogation or the obligation to reimburse the
27 All Maine Health Plan, the board may require that an individual who is entitled to
28 medical services from the source first seek those services from that source before
29 seeking those services from the All Maine Health Plan.
30 C. To the extent permitted by federal law, the board has the same right of subrogation
31 over contractual retiree health care benefits provided by employers as other contracts,
32 allowing the All Maine Health Plan to recover the cost of health care services provided
33 to individuals covered by the retiree benefits, unless arrangements are made to transfer
34 the revenues of the health care benefits directly to the All Maine Health Fund.
35 4. Defaults, underpayments and late payments. Default, underpayment or late
36 payment of any tax or other obligation imposed by this chapter results in the remedies and
37 penalties provided by law, except as provided in this section. Eligibility for health care
38 benefits under this chapter may not be impaired by any default, underpayment or late
39 payment of any premium or other obligation imposed by this chapter.
40 §7809. Provider payments

42 other providers as determined by the board, may participate in the All Maine Health Plan.

414 governing referral fees and fee splitting, including, but not limited to, 42 United States
425 Code, Sections 1320a-7b and 1395nn, whether reimbursed by federal funds or not. A fee
436 schedule or financial incentive may not adversely affect the care a patient receives or the
447 care a health care provider recommends.
5 2. Payments to noninstitutional providers. The All Maine Health Board shall
6 establish and oversee a fair and efficient payment system for noninstitutional providers in
7 accordance with this subsection.
8 A. The board shall pay noninstitutional providers based on rates negotiated with
9 providers. Rates must take into account the need to address provider shortages.
10 B. The board shall establish payment criteria and methods of payment for care
11 coordination for patients, especially those with chronic illness and complex medical
12 needs.

14 health care service may not bill the patient for the covered health care service except
15 as provided under a federal program.
16 D. Providers must be paid in a timely manner for claims filed in accordance with
17 procedures established by the board.
18 3. Payments to institutional providers. The board shall set annual budgets for
19 institutional providers. These budgets must consist of an operating budget and a capital
20 budget. An institution's annual budget must be set to cover its anticipated health care
21 services costs for the next year based on past performance and projected changes in prices
22 and health care service levels. The annual budget for each institutional provider must be
23 set separately. The board may not set a joint budget for a group of more than one
24 institutional provider or for a parent corporation that owns or operates one or more
25 institutional providers.
26 4. No balance billing. Providers who accept any payment from the All Maine Health
27 Plan for a covered health care service may not bill the patient for the covered health care
28 service except as provided under a federal program.
29 5. Capital investment plan. The board shall periodically develop a capital investment
30 plan that will serve as a guide in determining the annual budgets of institutional providers
31 and in deciding whether to approve applications for approval of capital expenditures by
32 noninstitutional providers in accordance with the criteria described in Title 22, section 327.
33 The board may alter the threshold expenditure level that triggers the requirement to submit
34 information on capital expenditures. Institutional providers shall propose these
35 expenditures and submit the required information as part of the annual budget they submit
36 to the board. Noninstitutional providers shall submit applications for approval of these
37 expenditures to the board. The board shall respond to capital expenditure applications in a
38 timely manner.
