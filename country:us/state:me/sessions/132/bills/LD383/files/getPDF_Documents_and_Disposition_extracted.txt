16 5. Provisions for establishing a landowner rights advisory board within the combined
17 entity to ensure that the operation of the combined entity and the rules adopted and enforced
18 by the combined entity are designed to uphold and protect the rights of landowners. The

28 regarding all applications, licenses, permits and other approvals may be accessed. Any
29 denial of approval for an applied-for license, permit or other approval must be based on

31 denial by the applicant must be issued by the combined entity within 30 days of the date
32 the appeal is filed;

37 impose financial burdens on landowners or businesses to identify appropriate funding to
38 address or develop an implementation plan to reduce those financial burdens. The
39 combined entity may not impose a new fee or increase an existing fee without the approval
40 of the Legislature. For any rule that unreasonably burdens a landowner's property use and

42 landowner for that financial loss. The combined entity must establish and provide funding
43 for a property rights compensation fund to ensure landowner compensation for such losses;
44 8. Provisions for requiring any proposed new rule of the combined entity to undergo a
45 cost-benefit analysis to assess financial impacts on landowners, local government and
Page 5 - 132LR0604(01)
416 businesses. Any new rule adopted by the combined entity must include provisions for
427 ensuring that the rule is subject to review every 5 years, during which time the combined
438 entity must decide to renew, amend or repeal the rule based on the assessed economic
449 burden of the rule and its impact on landowner rights. All rules adopted or amended by the
550 combined entity must be designated as major substantive rules as defined in the Maine
561 Revised Statutes, Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A; and
7 9. Identification of all statutory, administrative, technical and other changes or actions

28 regarding all applications, licenses, permits and other approvals may be accessed. Any
29 denial of approval for an applied-for license, permit or other approval must be based on

31 denial by the applicant must be issued by the combined entity within 30 days of the date

40 of the Legislature. For any rule that unreasonably burdens a landowner's property use and

43 for a property rights compensation fund to ensure landowner compensation for such losses;
44 8. Provisions for requiring any proposed new rule of the combined entity to undergo a
45 cost-benefit analysis to assess financial impacts on landowners, local government and
Page 5 - 132LR0604(01)

416 businesses. Any new rule adopted by the combined entity must include provisions for
427 ensuring that the rule is subject to review every 5 years, during which time the combined
438 entity must decide to renew, amend or repeal the rule based on the assessed economic
449 burden of the rule and its impact on landowner rights. All rules adopted or amended by the

561 Revised Statutes, Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A; and
