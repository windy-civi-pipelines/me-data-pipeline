Funding Disruptions
Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, uncertainty and lack of clarity surrounds the distribution of federal funding
to state agencies; and
Whereas, without federal funding, certain state agencies may have to lay off valuable
state employees; and
Whereas, if there are unavoidable layoffs, the State is bound, by contractual
obligations, to give 10 days' notice of an impending layoff to any bargaining unit employee;
and
Whereas, any state employee subject to a layoff due to lack of federal funding may
qualify for unemployment benefits; and
Whereas, state agencies will have to fund these unemployment benefits, which were
likely not accounted for in prior budgeting; and
Whereas, it is critically important that this legislation take effect before the expiration
of the 90-day period; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore,
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
Sec. 1. Transfer from Reserve for General Fund Operating Capital to
Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Departments and
Agencies - Statewide program, General Fund account. Notwithstanding any
provision of law to the contrary, the State Controller may transfer up to $2,500,000 from

shortfalls in an agency’s unemployment fund due to these unexpected layoffs.
Sec. 3. Transfer to Reserve for General Fund Operating Capital.
Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the State Controller on or before
June 30, 2026 shall transfer the unobligated balance from the Departments and Agencies -
