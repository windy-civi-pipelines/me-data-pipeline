8 obligations, to give 10 days' notice of an impending layoff to any bargaining unit employee;
9 and
10 Whereas, any state employee subject to a layoff due to lack of federal funding may
11 qualify for unemployment benefits; and

40 notice period that is contractually required when a state employee is laid off and to cover
41 shortfalls in an agency’s unemployment fund due to these unexpected layoffs.
