4 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:

6 Sec. A-1. Authorization of bonds. The Treasurer of State is authorized, under the
7 direction of the Governor, to issue bonds in the name and on behalf of the State in an
8 amount not exceeding $10,000,000 for the purposes described in section 5 of this Part. The
9 bonds are a pledge of the full faith and credit of the State. The bonds may not run for a
10 period longer than 10 years from the date of the original issue of the bonds.
11 Sec. A-2. Records of bonds issued; Treasurer of State. The Treasurer of State
12 shall ensure that an account of each bond is kept showing the number of the bond, the name
13 of the successful bidder to whom sold, the amount received for the bond, the date of sale
14 and the date when payable.
15 Sec. A-3. Sale; how negotiated; proceeds appropriated. The Treasurer of
16 State may negotiate the sale of the bonds by direction of the Governor, but no bond may
17 be loaned, pledged or hypothecated on behalf of the State. The proceeds of the sale of the
18 bonds, which must be held by the Treasurer of State and paid by the Treasurer of State
19 upon warrants drawn by the State Controller, are appropriated solely for the purposes set
20 forth in this Part. Any unencumbered balances remaining at the completion of the project
21 in this Part lapse to the Office of the Treasurer of State to be used for the retirement of
22 general obligation bonds.
23 Sec. A-4. Interest and debt retirement. The Treasurer of State shall pay interest
24 due or accruing on any bonds issued under this Part and all sums coming due for payment
25 of bonds at maturity.

38 all unencumbered appropriation balances representing state money carry forward. Bond
39 proceeds that have not been expended within 10 years after the date of the sale of the bonds
40 lapse to the Office of the Treasurer of State to be used for the retirement of general
41 obligation bonds.

13 State's opportunity zones?"
14 The legal voters of each city, town and plantation shall vote by ballot on this question
15 and designate their choice by a cross or check mark placed within a corresponding square

19 returns. If a majority of the legal votes are cast in favor of this Part, the Governor shall
20 proclaim the result without delay and this Part becomes effective 30 days after the date of
21 the proclamation.
22 The Secretary of State shall prepare and furnish to each city, town and plantation all
23 ballots, returns and copies of this Part necessary to carry out the purposes of this
24 referendum.
