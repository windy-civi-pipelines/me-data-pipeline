2 Sec. 1. 5 MRSA §7070, sub-§2, ¶E, as amended by PL 2023, c. 615, §2, is further
3 amended to read:
4 E. Except as provided in paragraph F and section 7070‑A, complaints, charges or
5 accusations of misconduct, replies to those complaints, charges or accusations and any
6 other information or materials that may result in disciplinary action. If disciplinary
7 action is taken, and that disciplinary action is of a nature that imposes or results in a
8 financial disadvantage, including, but not limited to, termination, demotion or
9 suspension without pay, the final written decision relating to that action is no longer
10 confidential after the decision is completed if it imposes or upholds discipline. The
11 decision must state the conduct or other facts on the basis of which disciplinary action
12 is being imposed and the conclusions of the acting authority as to the reasons for that
13 action. If an arbitrator completely overturns or removes disciplinary action from an
14 employee personnel file, the final written decision is public except that the employee's
15 name must be deleted from the final written decision and kept confidential. If the
16 employee whose name was deleted from the final written decision discloses that the
17 employee is the person who is the subject of the final written decision, the entire final
18 written report, with regard to that employee, is public.
19 For purposes of this paragraph, "final written decision" means:
20 (1) The final written administrative decision that is not appealed pursuant to a
21 grievance arbitration procedure; or
22 (2) If the final written administrative decision is appealed to arbitration, the final
23 written decision of a neutral arbitrator.
24 A final written administrative decision that is appealed to arbitration is no longer
25 confidential 120 days after a written request for the decision is made to the employer
26 if the final written decision of the neutral arbitrator is not issued and released before
27 the expiration of the 120 days; and
28 Sec. 2. 30-A MRSA §503, sub-§1, ¶B, as amended by PL 2023, c. 159, §2, is
29 further amended by amending subparagraph (5) to read:
30 (5) Complaints, charges or accusations of misconduct, replies to those complaints,
31 charges or accusations and any other information or materials that may result in
32 disciplinary action. If disciplinary action is taken, and that disciplinary action is
33 of a nature that imposes or results in a financial disadvantage, including, but not
34 limited to, termination, demotion or suspension without pay, the final written
35 decision relating to that action is no longer confidential after the decision is
36 completed if it imposes or upholds discipline. The decision must state the conduct
37 or other facts on the basis of which disciplinary action is being imposed and the
38 conclusions of the acting authority as to the reasons for that action. If an arbitrator
39 completely overturns or removes disciplinary action from an employee personnel
40 file, the final written decision is public except that the employee's name must be
41 deleted from the final written decision and kept confidential. If the employee
42 whose name was deleted from the final written decision discloses that the
43 employee is the person who is the subject of the final written decision, the entire
44 final written report, with regard to that employee, is public.

1 For purposes of this subparagraph, "final written decision" means:
2 (a) The final written administrative decision that is not appealed pursuant to a
3 grievance arbitration procedure; or
4 (b) If the final written administrative decision is appealed to arbitration, the
5 final written decision of a neutral arbitrator.
6 A final written administrative decision that is appealed to arbitration is no longer
7 confidential 120 days after a written request for the decision is made to the
8 employer if the final written decision of the neutral arbitrator is not issued and
9 released before the expiration of the 120 days; and
10 Sec. 3. 30-A MRSA §2702, sub-§1, ¶B, as amended by PL 2019, c. 451, §3, is
11 further amended by amending subparagraph (5) to read:
12 (5) Complaints, charges or accusations of misconduct, replies to those complaints,
13 charges or accusations and any other information or materials that may result in
14 disciplinary action. If disciplinary action is taken, and that disciplinary action is
15 of a nature that imposes or results in a financial disadvantage, including, but not
16 limited to, termination, demotion or suspension without pay, the final written
17 decision relating to that action is no longer confidential after the decision is
18 completed if it imposes or upholds discipline. The decision must state the conduct
19 or other facts on the basis of which disciplinary action is being imposed and the
20 conclusions of the acting authority as to the reasons for that action. If an arbitrator

23 deleted from the final written decision and kept confidential. If the employee
24 whose name was deleted from the final written decision discloses that the

26 final written report, with regard to that employee, is public.
27 For purposes of this subparagraph, "final written decision" means:

29 grievance arbitration procedure; or

35 released before the expiration of the 120 days; and
36 SUMMARY
3377 This bill modifies provisions of law related to the confidentiality of certain employee
3388 records. Under current law, if disciplinary action is taken against a state, county or
3399 municipal employee, the final written decision associated with the disciplinary action is not
4400 confidential. Under the bill, only disciplinary actions that are of a nature that impose or
4411 result in a financial disadvantage, including, but not limited to, termination, demotion or
4422 suspension without pay, may become public.
