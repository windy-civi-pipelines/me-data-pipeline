JOINT RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING MAY 1, 2025 AS
PUREBRED DOG DAY
WHEREAS, purebred dogs are living legacies of the cultures that created them, and
historically these dogs worked alongside their people and provided them companionship; and
WHEREAS, the service of these breeds continues today as they work alongside humans
while serving as guide dogs, service dogs, conservation dogs, livestock guardians, search and
rescue dogs, earthdogs, police dogs and canine soldiers serving alongside our military men and
women; and
WHEREAS, purebred dogs also serve as avalanche dogs, trackers, trailers, herders,
controllers of vermin, water rescuers, carting and sled dogs, retrievers, protectors, hunters and
bird dogs; and
WHEREAS, purebred dogs have been of enormous help to medical science, serving as
models for many heritable human diseases, playing a role in humanity's understanding of the
human and canine genomes and benefiting pharmaceutical research and development; and
WHEREAS, purebred dogs are guardians of family, home and hearth, and always they are
companions near and dear to humans; and
WHEREAS, each purebred breed is indelibly etched in the history of the culture that
created it just as surely as are that culture's music, art and language; and
WHEREAS, all dogs should be valued, whatever their ancestry, but the purpose-bred dog
and the predictability of its breed should be cherished and preserved; and
WHEREAS, there is currently no day set aside to celebrate and acknowledge the
contributions of the purebred dog; now, therefore, be it
RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Thirty-second Legislature
now assembled in the First Regular Session, on behalf of the people we represent, take this
opportunity to recognize May 1, 2025 as Purebred Dog Day in celebration of purebred dogs
and the many service and companion benefits they provide in Maine.
