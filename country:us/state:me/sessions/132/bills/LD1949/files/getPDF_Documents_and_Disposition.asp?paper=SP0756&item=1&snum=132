38 SUMMARY
3399 Part A of the bill requires the Public Utilities Commission to adopt rules prohibiting
4400 the disconnection of utility services of a residential customer for nonpayment if the
4411 residential customer is enrolled in, has begun the process to enroll in or has been denied
4422 enrollment in an assistance program administered by the Public Utilities Commission or
4433 another state agency and the customer attests to the utility that the customer or a member
Page 8 - 132LR2159(01)
414 of the customer's household is 65 years of age or older, is incapacitated or dependent or has
425 been certified within the last 12 months as having a medical condition or disability by a
436 medical professional or government authority. It also prohibits disconnections if a member
447 of the customer's household has not attained 12 months of age. The commission is required
458 to adopt a process by which a public utility may petition the commission to proceed with a
469 disconnection of a residential customer's service that would otherwise be prohibited. Part
570 A also prohibits a competitive electricity provider from entering into an agreement to
581 provide service to or renew a contract for generation service for a residential consumer that,
592 in the 12-month period prior to entering into the agreement or renewing a contract, has
1503 received low-income assistance unless the commission finds that the consumer would
1514 receive a lower rate by enrolling in or renewing the contract when compared to the
1525 standard-offer service available to that consumer.
13 Part B prohibits certain expenses from being included in a public utility's rates,
14 including fines and penalties, costs associated with travel, lodging and food for officers and
15 members of a public utility's or affiliated interest's board of directors, expenditures for
16 investor relations and certain costs associated with the attendance at, participation in,
17 preparation for or appeal of any contested rate case proceeding conducted before the
18 commission. If a public utility includes any prohibited expenses in rates, it is subject to
19 administrative penalties and the commission may direct the utility to use a portion of the
20 administrative penalties owed for the payment of a rebate to the public utility's customers.
21 In addition to an administrative penalty, the commission is required to order the public
22 utility to issue a refund to the public utility's customers, including interest.
23 Part C requires the commission to adopt rules to require public utilities with over
24 50,000 customers to file a quarterly docket with the commission containing data from the
25 previous quarter applicable to residential and nonresidential customers. The rules must
26 require that the filing data include information regarding customer overdue accounts,
27 disconnections, reconnections, deposits and payment plans. Part C also requires the
28 commission, within existing resources, to conduct a proceeding at least once every 5 years
29 to review administrative charges collected by a public utility with over 50,000 customers
30 during the preceding 5-year period to ensure that such administrative charges are in
31 compliance with applicable law. Part C also requires that if an investor-owned transmission
32 and distribution utility includes on a customer's bill a public policy charge, the utility must
33 include an accurate and comprehensive description of the costs and benefits of the
34 components of public policy charges, including, but not limited to, energy efficiency
35 programs, renewable energy programs and low-income energy assistance programs.
36 Part D amends the definition of "assisted project" in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title
37 26, section 1304, subsection 1-A to lower the size threshold of a project to which the
38 definition applies. It requires that certain percentages of total labor hours of the
39 construction, alteration or repair of a generation facility are performed by qualified
40 apprentices. Part D also requires the Public Utilities Commission, in executing its duties,
41 powers and regulatory functions under Title 35-A, while ensuring system reliability and
42 resource adequacy, to consider and incorporate environmental justice principles. It requires

38 SUMMARY
3399 Part A of the bill requires the Public Utilities Commission to adopt rules prohibiting
4400 the disconnection of utility services of a residential customer for nonpayment if the
4411 residential customer is enrolled in, has begun the process to enroll in or has been denied
4422 enrollment in an assistance program administered by the Public Utilities Commission or
4433 another state agency and the customer attests to the utility that the customer or a member
Page 8 - 132LR2159(01)

414 of the customer's household is 65 years of age or older, is incapacitated or dependent or has
425 been certified within the last 12 months as having a medical condition or disability by a
436 medical professional or government authority. It also prohibits disconnections if a member
447 of the customer's household has not attained 12 months of age. The commission is required
458 to adopt a process by which a public utility may petition the commission to proceed with a
469 disconnection of a residential customer's service that would otherwise be prohibited. Part
570 A also prohibits a competitive electricity provider from entering into an agreement to
581 provide service to or renew a contract for generation service for a residential consumer that,
592 in the 12-month period prior to entering into the agreement or renewing a contract, has
1503 received low-income assistance unless the commission finds that the consumer would
1514 receive a lower rate by enrolling in or renewing the contract when compared to the
1525 standard-offer service available to that consumer.
13 Part B prohibits certain expenses from being included in a public utility's rates,
14 including fines and penalties, costs associated with travel, lodging and food for officers and
15 members of a public utility's or affiliated interest's board of directors, expenditures for
16 investor relations and certain costs associated with the attendance at, participation in,
17 preparation for or appeal of any contested rate case proceeding conducted before the
18 commission. If a public utility includes any prohibited expenses in rates, it is subject to
19 administrative penalties and the commission may direct the utility to use a portion of the
20 administrative penalties owed for the payment of a rebate to the public utility's customers.
21 In addition to an administrative penalty, the commission is required to order the public
22 utility to issue a refund to the public utility's customers, including interest.
23 Part C requires the commission to adopt rules to require public utilities with over
24 50,000 customers to file a quarterly docket with the commission containing data from the
25 previous quarter applicable to residential and nonresidential customers. The rules must
26 require that the filing data include information regarding customer overdue accounts,
27 disconnections, reconnections, deposits and payment plans. Part C also requires the
28 commission, within existing resources, to conduct a proceeding at least once every 5 years
29 to review administrative charges collected by a public utility with over 50,000 customers
30 during the preceding 5-year period to ensure that such administrative charges are in
31 compliance with applicable law. Part C also requires that if an investor-owned transmission
32 and distribution utility includes on a customer's bill a public policy charge, the utility must
33 include an accurate and comprehensive description of the costs and benefits of the
34 components of public policy charges, including, but not limited to, energy efficiency
35 programs, renewable energy programs and low-income energy assistance programs.
36 Part D amends the definition of "assisted project" in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title
37 26, section 1304, subsection 1-A to lower the size threshold of a project to which the
38 definition applies. It requires that certain percentages of total labor hours of the
39 construction, alteration or repair of a generation facility are performed by qualified
40 apprentices. Part D also requires the Public Utilities Commission, in executing its duties,
41 powers and regulatory functions under Title 35-A, while ensuring system reliability and
42 resource adequacy, to consider and incorporate environmental justice principles. It requires
43 the commission, on or before April 1, 2026 and within existing resources, to establish a
44 community engagement plan.
