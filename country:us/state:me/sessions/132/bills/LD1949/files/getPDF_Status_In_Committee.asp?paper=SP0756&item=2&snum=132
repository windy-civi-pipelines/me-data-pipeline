2266 This amendment does the following.
27 1. It changes the eligibility criteria for a residential customer who is protected from
28 disconnection by a public utility for nonpayment and limits the criteria to customers of a
29 transmission and distribution utility.
30 2. It removes the provisions of the bill addressing sales practices of competitive
31 electricity providers.
32 3. In the section of the bill establishing limitations on expenses that may be included
33 in a public utility's rates, it excepts certain consumer-owned utilities from the prohibition
34 on the inclusion in rates of contributions to a trade association, chamber of commerce or
35 public charity, including, but not limited to, a charity managed by the public utility or
36 affiliated interest. It removes the prohibition on the inclusion in rates compensation for an
37 employee of a public utility or an employee of an affiliated interest if any portion of that
38 compensation is used by the employee for lobbying or paid by that employee to a federal,
39 state or local government official in an effort to influence any official decisions of or
40 legislative decisions by the governmental official. It also defines "investor relations" and
41 establishes an exception to the prohibition on the inclusion of expenditures for investor
42 relations. The amendment also establishes a cap on the monthly costs that may be included
43 in rates associated with any contested rate case proceeding conducted before the Public
44 Utilities Commission in which the Office of the Public Advocate participated.
