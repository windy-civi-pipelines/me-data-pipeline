18 B. The commission shall allocate to each investor-owned transmission and distribution

23 must be applied to offset the net energy billing costs allocated under this paragraph
24 subsection. The allocation must be based on each utility's total retail kilowatt-hour
25 energy sales to ratepayers that pay net energy billing costs. The commission may
26 determine the means to be used for the allocation required under this subsection, and
27 those means may include the direct transfer of funds between transmission and
28 distribution utilities.
29 Sec. 2. 35-A MRSA §3209-C, sub-§2, ¶C is enacted to read:
30 C. The commission shall allocate net energy billing costs by aggregating each rate
31 class across both investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities.
32 Sec. 3. 35-A MRSA §3210-F, sub-§3, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 454, §2, is

24 SUMMARY
2255 This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, replaces the bill, which
2266 is a concept draft, and changes the title. It repeals provisions of law requiring the Public
2277 Utilities Commission to allocate to each investor-owned transmission and distribution
2288 utility its pro rata share of certain costs and instead requires the commission to allocate
2299 those costs by aggregating each rate class across both investor-owned transmission and
3300 distribution utilities. It requires the commission, within 14 days of the effective date this
3311 legislation, to initiate a proceeding to allocate net energy billing costs and the eligible costs
3322 and benefits associated with long-term contracts by aggregating each rate class across both
3333 investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities. The commission is required to
3344 submit a report by January 10, 2026 to the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities
3355 and Technology that summarizes the proceeding, including any relevant data and any order
3366 issued by the commission. The committee may report out a bill to the Second Regular
3377 Session of the 132nd Legislature based on the commission's report.
