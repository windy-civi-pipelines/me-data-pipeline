Resolve, to Support Rural Health Care Workforce Recruitment
Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
Whereas, the State is experiencing a serious shortage of health care providers,
particularly in rural communities; and
Whereas, the changes to the Department of Labor's rules relating to equal pay
provided for in this legislation are designed to alleviate that health care provider shortage;
and
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
therefore, be it
Sec. 1. Department of Labor; rulemaking. Resolved: That the Department of
Labor shall initiate rulemaking to amend its Bureau of Labor Standards rule Chapter 12:
Rules Relating to Equal Pay, as follows:
1. The rule must be amended in Section I(G) to clarify, for the purposes of the
definition of "establishment," that different entities or facilities operated by a hospital or
health care entity at different physical locations are not considered a single establishment;
and
2. The rule must be amended in Section I(K) to clarify, for the purposes of the
definition of "seniority system," that preference under a seniority system must be given to
workers based on years of service or based on pertinent experience or credentials.
The rule changes directed under this section must be finally adopted by the department
no later than October 1, 2025. Rules adopted pursuant to this section are routine technical
rules as defined in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation
takes effect when approved.
