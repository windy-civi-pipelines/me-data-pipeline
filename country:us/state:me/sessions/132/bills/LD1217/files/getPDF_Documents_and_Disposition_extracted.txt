32 low-income community investment is considered to be held by the issuer through the
33 qualified equity investment's final credit allowance date.
34 SUMMARY
3355 This bill amends the Maine New Markets Capital Investment Program and the new
3366 markets capital investment income tax credit to establish a new tax credit authority, referred
3377 to as "the program 2 tax credit authority," for tax credit authority allocated by the Finance
3388 Authority of Maine on or after January 1, 2026. This bill establishes an application process
3399 for community development entities recognized as Maine funds and diverse Maine funds
4400 to receive an allocation of tax credit authority.
41 The effect of this change on the Maine New Markets Capital Investment Program is to
42 shorten the period, from 24 months to 6 months after receipt of the notice of allocation of
43 the tax credit authority, by which a community development entity must issue the equity
Page 5 - 132LR1143(01)
414 investments or debt securities and receive cash in the total amount of tax credits authorized.
425 The limit on the amount of tax credits authorized is unchanged.
3 The effect of this change on the new markets capital investment tax credit is to shorten
4 the time, from 24 months to 12 months after issuance of the qualified equity investment,
5 by which a community development entity must invest at least 85% of the purchase price
6 of the qualified equity investment in qualified low-income community investments before
7 recapture of the credit is allowed.
8 This bill makes conforming changes to the new markets capital investment tax credit
9 provisions to integrate impact qualified equity investments into the existing provisions
10 governing the eligibility for an allocation of tax credits under the Maine New Markets
11 Capital Investment Program. Under the bill, "impact qualified equity investment" means a
12 qualified equity investment if the cash purchase price is used to make an investment in a
13 qualified active low-income community business, which is a corporation, including a
14 nonprofit corporation, that serves economically disadvantaged areas, that has a principal
15 business operations location in this State and that is more than 50% owned by individuals
16 who are racial or ethnic minorities; members of a federally recognized Indian nation, tribe
17 or band; or veterans who are disabled.
18 Under the bill, the Finance Authority of Maine is required to certify $30,000,000 in
19 impact qualified equity investments, which may be made in exchange for tax credits. Fifty
20 percent of impact qualified equity investments must be reserved for diverse Maine funds,
21 which are community development financial institutions that have their principal place of
22 business in this State and are more than 50% owned and controlled by individuals who are
23 racial or ethnic minorities or members of a federally recognized Indian nation, tribe or band
24 in this State or are governed by a board of directors more than 50% of which is composed
25 of individuals who are racial or ethnic minorities or members of a federally recognized
26 Indian nation, tribe or band in this State.
27 The maximum amount of an investment made with a qualified equity investment by a
28 qualified community development entity in a qualified active low-income community
29 business is $5,000,000.

32 low-income community investment is considered to be held by the issuer through the
33 qualified equity investment's final credit allowance date.
34 SUMMARY
3355 This bill amends the Maine New Markets Capital Investment Program and the new
3366 markets capital investment income tax credit to establish a new tax credit authority, referred
3377 to as "the program 2 tax credit authority," for tax credit authority allocated by the Finance
3388 Authority of Maine on or after January 1, 2026. This bill establishes an application process
3399 for community development entities recognized as Maine funds and diverse Maine funds
4400 to receive an allocation of tax credit authority.
41 The effect of this change on the Maine New Markets Capital Investment Program is to
42 shorten the period, from 24 months to 6 months after receipt of the notice of allocation of
43 the tax credit authority, by which a community development entity must issue the equity
Page 5 - 132LR1143(01)

414 investments or debt securities and receive cash in the total amount of tax credits authorized.
425 The limit on the amount of tax credits authorized is unchanged.
3 The effect of this change on the new markets capital investment tax credit is to shorten
4 the time, from 24 months to 12 months after issuance of the qualified equity investment,
5 by which a community development entity must invest at least 85% of the purchase price
6 of the qualified equity investment in qualified low-income community investments before
7 recapture of the credit is allowed.
8 This bill makes conforming changes to the new markets capital investment tax credit
9 provisions to integrate impact qualified equity investments into the existing provisions
10 governing the eligibility for an allocation of tax credits under the Maine New Markets
11 Capital Investment Program. Under the bill, "impact qualified equity investment" means a
12 qualified equity investment if the cash purchase price is used to make an investment in a
13 qualified active low-income community business, which is a corporation, including a
14 nonprofit corporation, that serves economically disadvantaged areas, that has a principal
15 business operations location in this State and that is more than 50% owned by individuals
16 who are racial or ethnic minorities; members of a federally recognized Indian nation, tribe
17 or band; or veterans who are disabled.
18 Under the bill, the Finance Authority of Maine is required to certify $30,000,000 in
19 impact qualified equity investments, which may be made in exchange for tax credits. Fifty
20 percent of impact qualified equity investments must be reserved for diverse Maine funds,
21 which are community development financial institutions that have their principal place of
22 business in this State and are more than 50% owned and controlled by individuals who are
23 racial or ethnic minorities or members of a federally recognized Indian nation, tribe or band
24 in this State or are governed by a board of directors more than 50% of which is composed
25 of individuals who are racial or ethnic minorities or members of a federally recognized
26 Indian nation, tribe or band in this State.
27 The maximum amount of an investment made with a qualified equity investment by a
28 qualified community development entity in a qualified active low-income community
29 business is $5,000,000.
